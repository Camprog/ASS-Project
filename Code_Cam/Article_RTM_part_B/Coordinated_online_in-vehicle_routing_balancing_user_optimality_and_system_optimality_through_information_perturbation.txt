"Transportation Research Part B: MethodologicalCoordinated online in-vehicle routing balancing user optimality and system optimality through information perturbationAbstract The inconsistence between system optimality and user optimality represents one of the key difficulties on network traffic congestion control. The advanced connected vehicle systems, enabling smart vehicles to possess/exchange real-time information and conduct portable computation, provide new opportunities to address this challenge. Motivated by this view, this study proposes a coordinated online in-vehicle routing mechanism with intentional information provision perturbation (CRM-IP), which seeks to shape individual vehicles online routing decisions so that user optimality and system optimality are balanced, by exploiting bounded rationality of the users. The proposed CRM-IP is modeled as a pure strategy atomic routing game, and implemented by a sequentially updating distributed algorithm. The mathematical analysis is conducted to quantify the absolute gain of system optimality corresponding to the loss of user optimality resulting from a given level of the information perturbation in the worst case so that the efficiency of the information perturbation can be evaluated. Furthermore, numerical experiments conducted based on City of Sioux Falls network investigate the average effects of the CRM-IP on system optimality and user optimality under various network traffic conditions, comparing to the CRM developed by Du et al. (in press). The results indicate that the improvement of system optimality and the reduction of individual vehicles\u2019 travel time from the CRM is more significant when the network traffic is under an mild congestion state, such as under the levels of service (LOS\u2019s) C, D, and E, rather than under extremely sparse or congested states, such as under LOS\u2019s A and B, or F. Moreover, higher level of information perturbation benefits system optimality more, but the marginal effect decreases after the perturbation reaching certain level, such as \u03bb = 0.1 in this case study. In addition, a portion of vehicles may sacrifice user optimality due to the information perturbation, but the extent of the sacrifice is not significant, even though it increases with the information perturbation level. Hence, a small information perturbation is recommended to achieve an efficient network traffic control through the CRM-IP. Overall, this study proposes the CRM-IP as an efficient routing mechanism, which has a great potential to guide the routing decisions of individual vehicles so that their collective behavior improve network performance in both system optimality and user optimality.serial JL 271728 291210 291772 291817 31 Transportation Research Part B: Methodological TRANSPORTATIONRESEARCHPARTBMETHODOLOGICAL 2015-06-25 2015-06-25 2015-06-25 2015-06-25 2015-08-20T08:48:02 1-s2.0-S0191261515001241 S0191-2615(15)00124-1 S0191261515001241 10.1016/j.trb.2015.05.020 S300 S300.1 FULL-TEXT 1-s2.0-S0191261515X00075 2018-03-27T17:47:13.766088Z 0 0 20150901 20150930 2015 2015-06-25T04:44:40.879631Z absattachment articleinfo articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright crossmark dateloaded dateloadedtxt datesearch datesort dateupdated dco docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid indexeddate issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdateend pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype ssids alllist content subj subheadings suppl tomb volfirst volissue volumelist webpdf webpdfpagecount yearnav figure table e-component body mmlmath affil appendices articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authkeywords authlast footnotes highlightsabst primabst ref 0191-2615 01912615 true 79 79 C Volume 79 7 121 133 121 133 201509 September 2015 2015-09-01 2015-09-30 2015 article fla Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract The inconsistence between system optimality and user optimality represents one of the key difficulties on network traffic congestion control. The advanced connected vehicle systems, enabling smart vehicles to possess/exchange real-time information and conduct portable computation, provide new opportunities to address this challenge. Motivated by this view, this study proposes a coordinated online in-vehicle routing mechanism with intentional information provision perturbation (CRM-IP), which seeks to shape individual vehicles online routing decisions so that user optimality and system optimality are balanced, by exploiting bounded rationality of the users. The proposed CRM-IP is modeled as a pure strategy atomic routing game, and implemented by a sequentially updating distributed algorithm. The mathematical analysis is conducted to quantify the absolute gain of system optimality corresponding to the loss of user optimality resulting from a given level of the information perturbation in the worst case so that the efficiency of the information perturbation can be evaluated. Furthermore, numerical experiments conducted based on City of Sioux Falls network investigate the average effects of the CRM-IP on system optimality and user optimality under various network traffic conditions, comparing to the CRM developed by Du et al. (in press). The results indicate that the improvement of system optimality and the reduction of individual vehicles\u2019 travel time from the CRM is more significant when the network traffic is under an mild congestion state, such as under the levels of service (LOS\u2019s) C, D, and E, rather than under extremely sparse or congested states, such as under LOS\u2019s A and B, or F. Moreover, higher level of information perturbation benefits system optimality more, but the marginal effect decreases after the perturbation reaching certain level, such as \u03bb = 0.1 in this case study. In addition, a portion of vehicles may sacrifice user optimality due to the information perturbation, but the extent of the sacrifice is not significant, even though it increases with the information perturbation level. Hence, a small information perturbation is recommended to achieve an efficient network traffic control through the CRM-IP. Overall, this study proposes the CRM-IP as an efficient routing mechanism, which has a great potential to guide the routing decisions of individual vehicles so that their collective behavior improve network performance in both system optimality and user optimality. Keywords Coordinated in-vehicle routing Information perturbation Routing game Distributed algorithms 1 Introduction and motivation Connected vehicle systems (CVS\u2019s) including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) information exchange have a great potential to address main challenges in current transportation systems such as traffic safety, mobility, as well as environmental relevant issues, and thus have attracted significant attention from both academia and industry. What interests this study most is that CVS\u2019s provide individual drivers the access to real-time traffic information as well as the mobility information of neighborhood vehicles, which enables two critical capabilities: (1) Individual vehicles may perform adaptive and intelligent route choice decision en-route to avoid traffic congestion. (2) Traffic controller may perform traffic congestion control through strategic information provision, which affects individual vehicles\u2019 route decisions to approach desired system performance. Namely, if proper route guidance combined with strategic information provision is provided, we expect that both system and individual vehicles will benefit from traffic congestion management, given vehicles still perform selfish and self-directed route choices. Motivated by the above features, Du et al. (in press) proposed a coordinated routing mechanism (CRM) that allows smart vehicles to \u201cnegotiate\u201d with each other when they make online routing decisions enroute, so that potential traffic congestion in the near future can be avoid to some extent. Even though the experiment results indicates the CRM leads to significant improvement of system performance compared to the traditional independent routing mechanism (IRM), 1 smart vehicles make best reaction according to the real-time information independently without coordination. 1 this study noticed that the CRM does not explicitly sustain system optimality (i.e., minimizing system total travel time) and only considers user optimality (i.e., no smart vehicles can benefit from deviating from an equilibrium joint routing decision; note that user(s) and vehicle(s) are exchangeable throughout the paper). It is well known that user optimality is crucial to ensure the complying of a routing guidance, but improving system performance is the ultimate gaol of a transportation congestion management. Unfortunately, user optimality and system optimality do not coincide most of the time in reality. This fact represents one of the key challenges for efficient traffic congestion management. At the mean time, recent studies of bounded rationality of the travelers (i.e., a small difference of the travel cost is usually not perceived) indicate that it is affordable to compromise user optimality to some extent in exchange for improved system performance. Inspired by the above views, this study moves forward from Du et al. (in press) and develops a coordinated online in-vehicle routing mechanism with information perturbation (CRM-IP), which balances user optimality and system optimality under the framework of the CRM by intentionally perturbing information provision. More specifically, this mechanism is built upon a system composed by the following items: (1) Smart vehicles which are about to make route choices forms a routing coordination group. Each smart vehicle here is willing to share traffic information including its (tentative) route choice; and (2) an information center that collects, processes, and dissimulates real-time information including general traffic condition, vehicles\u2019 tentative route choice, and travel time prediction among smart vehicles. The routing decision making process following the CRM-IP is described as follows. Smart vehicles in the coordination group propose their tentative route choices according to predicted route travel time provided by the information center, and then inform the information center their tentative route choices. The information center collects the tentative route choices, predicts the travel time, performs a strategic perturbation and then disseminates to smart vehicles. Next, the smart vehicles again propose their tentative route choices according to the newly predicted travel time. This process continues until no vehicles have the incentive to change their routes. This study models the CRM-IP as a pure strategy, 2 This game is called a pure strategy game since the vehicles\u2019 strategy set is composed of individual paths instead of the probability distributions on the paths. 2 atomic routing game possessing an equilibrium joint routing decision, which can be searched by a designed sequentially updating distributed algorithm (SUDA (Du et al., in press)). Both theoretical analyses and numerical experiments in this study prove that the proposed CRM-IP leads to a joint routing decision, for which the relative loss in user optimality (will be made precision later in the paper) can be bounded from above by how much perturbation is added; more importantly, the absolute gain in system performance can be bounded from below in terms of the absolute loss in user optimality. The main contributions of the paper are highlighted by: (i) proposing a coordinated online in-vehicle routing mechanism with information perturbation based on game theory; (ii) Rigourously bounding user optimality loss and system optimality improvement in terms of information perturbation level; and (iii) Conducting numerical experiments to demonstrate the effects of information perturbation on both user optimality and system optimality under the CRM-IP routing mechanism. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing relevant studies. Sections 3 and 4 together develop the CRM-IP by introducing the CRM and developing information provision strategy respectively. Mathematical analyses on the effects of this perturbation on system optimality and user optimality are also provided in Section 4. Further, Section 5 presents a distributed algorithm to search a joint routing decision of smart vehicles following the CRM-IP. Section 6 conducts numerical experiments to investigate the average performance of the CRM-IP; insights and discussions based on the experiment results are included. Section 7 concludes the paper. 2 Literature review Coordinated routing is a relatively new concept since it is only made possible in recent years due to the incredible progress in various enabling technologies including wireless communication, smart devices, portable computation, GPS based traffic sensing, and so on. Two pieces of closely related work in the literature are Du et al. (in press, 2014). Both papers concentrate on coordinated routing mechanisms, but differ in routing decision strategy. More exactly, Du et al. (in press) assumes that vehicles choose a single route among candidate routes (i.e., pure strategy), while Du et al. (2014) assumes that vehicles choose probability distribute among a few candidate routes (i.e., mixed strategy). However, neither of these two papers explicitly considers/guarantees system performance even though both of their experiment results indicate a great potential of improvement compared to the cases in which vehicles following IRM (independent routing mechanisms). This study is a major step forward on top of Du et al. (in press). The novelties and significant breakthrough stand on two aspects: (i) Affecting vehicles\u2019 collective behavior via artificially perturbing information provision so that a good balance of system optimality and user optimality can be archived; and (ii) Conducting mathematical analyses on the proposed approach, and providing theoretical proofs to sustain the effect of the proposed CRM-IP on system optimality and user optimality. The numerical experiments, based on a real world transportation network, further demonstrate the application potential of the proposed mechanism under various traffic regimes. From a broader point of view, the proposed research shares the same interests in developing real-time in-vehicle routing guidance systems in literature. Two reviews provided by Schmitt and Jula (2006) and Stier-Moses (2004) classify previous efforts into active guidance system (Pavlis and Papageorgiou, 1999; Wang et al., 2001; Papageorgiou, 1990; Minciardi and Gaetani, 2001; Deflorio, 2003; Jahn et al., 2005) vs. predictive guidance system (Kaufman et al., 1991; Kaysi et al., 1993; Messner and Papageorgiou, 1990; Kotsialos et al., 2002; Yang and Koutsopoulos, 1996). As discussed in Du et al. (in press), these papers mostly belong to the family of IRM, by following which individual vehicles independently make routing decisions without any coordination according to estimated/predicted real-time traffic information. More discussions on how they differ from the CRM can be found in Du et al. (in press, 2014). 3 CRM and pure strategy atomic routing game For completeness of the work, this section first briefly introduces the framework of the CRM without information perturbation. The CRM is developed for a transportation network denoted by a directed graph G ( N , A ) with N being the set of nodes and A being the set of arcs. Let the number of arcs be l = | A | and the total number of nodes be n = | N | . Suppose there are m vehicles (note that this study does not differentiate vehicle and smart vehicles in most of the places except it is specially stated), labeled by \u03bd = 1 , \u2026 , m , equipped with wireless communication and onboard computation equipments traversing the network. Each vehicle \u03bd has a specific origin\u2013destination (OD) pair given by ( o \u03bd , d \u03bd ) \u2208 N \u00d7 N with a set of k \u03bd possible paths connecting them, denoted by P \u03bd \u225c { p \u03bd 1 , \u2026 , p \u03bd k \u03bd } . Note that two vehicles may have the same OD pair. We assume that, real-time traffic information is collected and processed by an information center and then made available to all the vehicles. In particular, the information center is aware of two pieces of information: (i) the real-time flow/volume information on individual links; (ii) the real-time aggregated information on the vehicles\u2019 route choices. Both Information (i) and (ii) can be collected through the communication among individual vehicles (V2V communication), and between information center and smart vehicles (V2I communication). The privacy obstacle can be solved by privacy protection techniques, see Jung et al. (2012). With information (i) and (ii), the information center is able to predict the travel time on each link \u2113 given f \u2113 vehicles decide to take it. The link travel time function of traffic flow is denoted by C \u2113 ( f \u2113 ) , f \u2113 = 0 , \u2026 , n . We assume that C \u2113 ( \u00b7 ) is the well known BPR function, i.e., (1) C \u2113 ( f \u2113 ) = t \u2113 1 + \u03b1 f \u2113 C \u2113 \u03b2 , where t \u2113 represents the free flow travel time on link \u2113 ; C \u2113 represents the capacity on link \u2113 , \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the given positive scalars with \u03b2 normally greater than 3 to capture the natural of traffic congestion. It is clear that C \u2113 ( \u00b7 ) is differentiable, and its first derivative also increases as f \u2113 increases. The predicted link travel time based on information (i) and (ii) is disseminated to the vehicles through V2I communication, and the vehicles finds the shortest paths based on the link travel time obtained from the information center. Note that the travel time for each vehicle \u03bd depends on not only its own route choice p \u03bd but also the other vehicles tentative route choices p - \u03bd . Given a joint route choice decision ( p \u03bd , p - \u03bd ) for all vehicles \u03bd = 1 , \u2026 , m , the total number of vehicles choosing link \u2113 is given by (2) f \u2113 ( p \u03bd , p - \u03bd ) = \u2211 \u03bd = 1 m \u03b4 \u03bd \u2113 , where (3) \u03b4 \u03bd \u2113 = 1 , if \u2113 \u2208 p \u03bd 0 , otherwise . Therefore, the route travel time of vehicle \u03bd on route p \u03bd , given all other vehicles\u2019s route choices p - \u03bd , is formulated as T \u03bd ( p \u03bd , p - \u03bd ) = \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 p \u03bd C \u2113 ( f \u2113 ( p \u03bd , p - \u03bd ) ) , \u03bd = 1 , \u2026 , m . Note that here we regard f \u2113 ( \u00b7 ) as a function that maps a joint route choice to the corresponding volume on link \u2113 as shown in Eq. (2). In the rest of the paper, f \u2113 will be used to denote the volume on link \u2113 . As aforementioned, the CRM proposes an autonomous negotiation process involving all the m vehicles in the communication group, assuming each vehicle tries to minimize its only travel time given other vehicles\u2019 route choices are known. More exactly, the vehicles that are about to make their route choice decisions in a short time slot forms a communication group, in which they negotiate future route choice by proposing and re-propose their tentative route choices according to the aggregated route choice information from other vehicles. This process continues until an equilibrium is achieved. This coordinated routing process in a communication group forms a routing game among the vehicles. Clearly, the routing game is a pure-strategy and atomic game. The resolution of this game is an equilibrium joint routing decision, namely, a combination of the vehicles\u2019 route choices p \u2217 \u225c { p \u03bd \u2217 } \u03bd = 1 m = ( p \u03bd \u2217 , p - \u03bd \u2217 ) , in which for all vehicles \u03bd = 1 , \u2026 , m (4) T \u03bd ( p \u03bd \u2217 , p - \u03bd \u2217 ) \u2a7d T \u03bd ( p \u03bd , p - \u03bd \u2217 ) , \u2200 p \u03bd \u2208 P \u03bd , p \u03bd \u2260 p \u03bd \u2217 . That is to say no vehicles has the incentive to deviate from its current route choice unilaterally. Notice that the routing game we discussed is indeed a special case of the congestion game first proposed by Rosenthal (1973). Therefore, an equilibrium joint routing decision of the proposed mechanism can be explored by an equivalent integer programming model given in (5), in which the decision variables x \u03bd i are defined as follows: x \u03bd i = 1 if vehicle \u03bd takes path p \u03bd i 0 otherwise f \u2113 = number of vehicles taking link \u2113 . Equivalent Integer Program (EIP): (5) min F ( f \u2113 ) = \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l \u2211 z = 0 f \u2113 C \u2113 ( z ) s . t . \u2211 i = 1 k \u03bd x \u03bd i = 1 , \u2200 \u03bd = 1 , \u2026 , m , f \u2113 - \u2211 \u03bd = 1 M \u2211 p \u03bd i \u220b \u2113 x \u03bd i , = 0 , \u2200 \u2113 = 1 , \u2026 , l , x \u03bd i \u2208 { 0 , 1 } , \u2200 \u03bd = 1 , \u2026 , m , i = 1 , \u2026 , k \u03bd , f \u2113 \u2a7e 0 \u2200 \u2113 = 1 , \u2026 , l . In (5), the first constraint ensures each vehicle only takes one path and the rest of the constraints sustain the flow conservation. Then we have Theorem 1 stating the existence of the equilibrium joint routing decision. Its proof can be found in Rosenthal (1973) and so will not be included here. According to Theorem 1, the objective function of EIP in (5) is actually a potential function of the routing game (i.e., the CRM). Theorem 1 An equilibrium joint routing decision always exists for the routing game formed by the vehicles making routing decisions following the CRM. Moreover, let ( x \u203e , f \u203e ) be an optimal solution of the integer program (5), where x \u203e = { x \u203e \u03bd i } \u03bd = 1 , \u2026 , m ; i = 1 , \u2026 , k \u03bd and f \u203e = { f \u203e \u2113 } \u2113 = 1 , \u2026 , l , define (6) p \u03bd \u2217 = p \u03bd i , if x \u203e \u03bd i = 1 , \u2200 \u03bd = 1 , \u2026 , m , then p \u2217 = { p \u03bd \u2217 } \u03bd = 1 m is an equilibrium joint routing decision. 4 System performance and information perturbation While an equilibrium joint routing decision of the CRM guarantees user optimality, theoretically, the system cost at an equilibrium joint routing decision can be significantly worse than a system optimal joint routing decision in the worst case (price of anarchy), see Roughgarden and Tardos (2002) and many follow-up papers. On the other hand, user optimality is crucial for the vehicles (travelers) to follow the route suggested by the CRM, even though it does not have to be exactly optimal due to bounded rationality of the travelers. In particular, for a traveller, if the reduction in travel time by switching from the suggested route to another route is not significant enough, then he or she may not notice the difference, and hence comply the suggested route. Following this idea, this proposed CRM-IP, which exploits travelers\u2019 bounded rationality in the sense that we sacrifice user optimality to some extent by intentionally perturbing the provided travel time information to exchange for improvement in system performance under the routing mechanism of the CRM. The existence of the CRM-IP is also guaranteed by Theorem 1. This equilibrium joint route decision will be shown to violate user optimality (under the original travel time) by a limited amount but reduce the system cost (under the original travel time) significantly. This section is devoted to demonstrate how the aforementioned perturbation is implemented and provide mathematical analyses on its effects on system optimality and user optimality. To do so, we first exam the relationship between system optimal and equilibrium joint routing decisions. Given a joint routing decision { p \u03bd } \u03bd = 1 m , let the link volume be given by f \u2113 = \u2211 \u03bd = 1 m \u03b4 \u03bd \u2113 , where \u03b4 \u03bd \u2113 is defined in (3). The system performance, measured by the overall system travel time, is given by \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l f \u2113 C \u2113 ( f \u2113 ) . Using the same definitions of the decision variables as those in the EIP, we model the system optimal problem (SOP) below. (7) min \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l f \u2113 C \u2113 ( f \u2113 ) s . t . \u2211 i = 1 k \u03bd x \u03bd i = 1 , \u2200 \u03bd = 1 , \u2026 , m f \u2113 - \u2211 \u03bd = 1 m \u2211 p \u03bd i \u220b \u2113 x \u03bd i , = 0 , \u2200 \u2113 = 1 , \u2026 , l , x \u03bd i \u2208 { 0 , 1 } , \u2200 \u03bd = 1 , \u2026 , M , i = 1 , \u2026 , k \u03bd , f \u2113 \u2a7e 0 \u2200 \u2113 = 1 , \u2026 , l . 4.1 Information perpetuation It is noticed that the SOP in (7) shares the same set of constraints with the EIP in (5), but their objective functions are different. Then, it is possible that we revise the link cost function so that an equilibrium routing resolution satisfying the optimum of the EIP under the revised cost function corresponds to a system optimum of the SOP under the original link cost function. In particular, this study defines a revised link cost function for each link \u2113 as (8) C ^ \u2113 ( f ) = 0 if f = 0 fC \u2113 ( f ) - ( f - 1 ) C \u2113 ( f - 1 ) if f \u2a7e 1 . It can be demonstrated that the objective value of the EIP under C ^ \u2113 ( f ) is (9) \u2211 z = 0 f \u2113 C ^ \u2113 ( z ) = f \u2113 C \u2113 ( f \u2113 ) , \u2200 f \u2113 = 0 , 1 , \u2026 , which is the same to the system cost given in the SOP model as original travel time C \u2113 ( f \u2113 ) is applied. In addition, given C \u2113 ( f ) is a increasing function, C ^ \u2113 ( f ) is also an increasing function since C ^ \u2113 ( f + 1 ) - C ^ \u2113 ( f ) is always positive (see the demonstration below). C ^ \u2113 ( f + 1 ) - C ^ \u2113 ( f ) = C \u2113 ( 1 ) , if f = 0 , ( f + 1 ) C \u2113 ( f + 1 ) - ( f - 1 ) C \u2113 ( f - 1 ) , if f \u2a7e 1 , Therefore, we conclude Lemma 2 below. Lemma 2 Employing the revised travel cost given in (8), the CRM stops at an equilibrium solution (i.e., an optimal solution of the EIP model using the revised travel cost), which is a system optimal solution of the SOP model using un-revised travel cost. Inspired by Lemma 2, this study designs the perturbed link cost function as a convex combination of C \u2113 ( f ) and C ^ \u2113 ( f ) so that we can incorporate system optimality consideration into the routing guidance of the CRM-IP, i.e., (10) C \u223c \u2113 , \u03bb ( f ) = \u03bb C ^ \u2113 ( f ) + ( 1 - \u03bb ) C \u2113 ( f ) , \u03bb \u2208 [ 0 , 1 ] , \u2113 \u2208 l , where the parameter \u03bb represents the level of the information perturbation. Clearly, \u03bb = 0 represents a scenario with no information perturbation, and \u03bb = 1 indicates an overwhelming perturbation to pursue system optimality. Intuitively, a joint equilibrium routing decision of the CRM-IP should be somewhere between original equilibrium and system optimum, depending on the information perturbed level. We will prove a few results that make this intuition precise. Before moving on to the detailed analysis, this study first notices that an equilibrium joint routing decision under the CRM-IP with C \u223c \u2113 , \u03bb ( \u00b7 ) being the link cost can be obtained from solving the EIP model, but replacing C \u2113 ( \u00b7 ) by C \u2113 , \u03bb ( \u00b7 ) . Accordingly, we define a perturbed EIP, denoted by EIP \u223c \u03bb . 4.2 Effect of information perturbation on user optimality By using the information perturbation, it is possible that some users may sacrifice travel time (i.e., lose its optimality from the original travel time function), since the perturbed information presents certain level of information inferiority. If a user deviates from the route suggested by the CRM-IP and choices a different route (such as p \u03bd \u2032 ), it is possible that this user may decrease his/her travel time. Theorem 3 below bounds how much a user may lose his/her optimality due to following the CRM-IP in terms of a given information perturbation level \u03bb. Theorem 3 For any given \u03bb \u2208 [ 0 , 1 ] , an equilibrium joint routing decision p \u0303 ( \u03bb ) = { p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) } \u03bd = 1 m under the CRM-IP is a \u03bb \u03b2 -approximation to the equilibrium under the CRM, i.e., the route costs under the CRM and the CRM-IP have the relationship below: (11) \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) C \u2113 ( f \u0303 \u2113 ) \u2a7d ( 1 + \u03bb \u03b2 ) \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) \u2229 p \u03bd \u2032 C \u2113 ( f \u0303 \u2113 ) + \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 p \u03bd \u2032 \u29f9 p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) C \u2113 ( f \u0303 \u2113 + 1 ) , for all p \u03bd \u2032 \u2208 P \u03bd and all \u03bd = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , m . f \u0303 \u2113 ( \u03bb ) = f \u2113 ( p \u0303 ( \u03bb ) ) . Proof Note that for any \u2113 \u2208 p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) , we must have f \u0303 \u2113 \u2a7e 1 . In addition, if a user \u03bd switches to p \u03bd \u2032 , then f \u0303 \u2113 will not change for all the links belonging to both p \u03bd \u2032 and p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) (i.e., \u2113 \u2208 p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) \u2229 p \u03bd \u2032 ( \u03bb ) ), but f \u0303 \u2113 will increase one unit for links only in p \u03bd \u2032 ( \u03bb ) (i.e., \u2113 \u2208 p \u03bd \u2032 \u29f9 p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) ). Since p \u0303 ( \u03bb ) is an equilibrium under the link cost function C \u223c \u2113 , \u03bb ( \u00b7 ) , we must have the inequality for any \u03bd below, given any p \u03bd \u2032 \u2208 P \u03bd . (12) \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) C \u223c \u2113 , \u03bb ( f \u0303 \u2113 ) \u2a7d \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) \u2229 p \u03bd \u2032 C \u223c \u2113 , \u03bb ( f \u0303 \u2113 ) + \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 p \u03bd \u2032 \u29f9 p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) C \u223c \u2113 , \u03bb ( f \u0303 \u2113 + 1 ) According to (8) and (10), when f \u2a7e 1 , we have the perturbed link cost for a given \u03bb. (13) C \u223c \u2113 , \u03bb ( f ) = ( 1 - \u03bb ) C \u2113 ( f ) + \u03bb fC \u2113 ( f ) - \u03bb ( f - 1 ) C \u2113 ( f - 1 ) = ( 1 - \u03bb ) C \u2113 ( f ) + \u03bb C \u2113 ( f ) + \u03bb ( f - 1 ) C \u2113 ( f ) - \u03bb ( f - 1 ) C \u2113 ( f - 1 ) = C \u2113 ( f ) + \u03bb ( f - 1 ) ( C \u2113 ( f ) - C \u2113 ( f - 1 ) ) Then, the inequality in Eq. (12) can be further derived as follows.

For example, if \u03b2 = 4 , and we take \u03bb = 0.025 then we are guaranteed to obtain a 0.1-approximate equilibrium joint routing decision. The above study demonstrates the loss of user optimality resulting from information perturbation by a ratio of travel time loss, which is a function of \u03bb. Next, this study exams the loss of user optimality after information perturbation by the difference between the objective values of EIP and EIP \u223c \u03bb defined by (5). More exactly, the following lemma holds. Lemma 5 Let p \u0303 ( \u03bb ) = { p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) } \u03bd = 1 m be an equilibrium joint routing decision under the CRM-IP with C \u223c \u2113 , \u03bb ( \u00b7 ) being the link cost function, f \u0303 \u2113 represents the corresponding volume on link \u2113 . i.e., for each link \u2113 , f \u0303 \u2113 = f \u2113 ( p \u0303 ( \u03bb ) ) , and f \u2113 \u2217 1 , \u2026 , l represents an equilibrium link volume under link cost functions C \u2113 ( \u00b7 ) . This study denotes the difference between the objective values of EIP and EIP \u223c \u03bb by \u0394 \u03bb , i.e., (19) \u0394 \u03bb = \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l \u2211 z = 0 f \u0303 \u2113 C \u2113 ( z ) - \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l \u2211 z = 0 f \u2113 \u2217 C \u2113 ( z ) . Then it is concluded that for any vehicle \u03bd, its user optimality loss in travel time at most \u0394 \u03bb (if it deviates from joint routing decision { p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) } \u03bd = 1 m unilaterally), given information perturbation level is \u03bb. That is, for any \u03bd \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) C \u2113 ( f \u0303 \u2113 ) - \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 p \u03bd \u2032 C \u2113 ( f \u2113 \u2032 ) \u2a7d \u0394 \u03bb . for any p \u03bd \u2032 \u2208 P \u03bd , with f \u2113 \u2032 = f \u2113 ( p \u03bd \u2032 , p \u0303 - \u03bd ( \u03bb ) ) . Proof Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists a vehicle \u03bd and a path p \u03bd \u2032 \u2208 P \u03bd such that \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 p \u03bd \u2032 C \u2113 ( f \u2113 \u2032 ) < \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) C \u2113 ( f \u0303 \u2113 ) - \u0394 \u03bb . Note that the travel time on the links that are in both p \u03bd \u2032 and p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) has not been changed. So we have (20) \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 p \u03bd \u2032 , \u2113 \u2209 p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) C \u2113 ( f \u2113 \u2032 ) < \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) , \u2113 \u2209 p \u03bd \u2032 C \u2113 ( f \u0303 \u2113 ) - \u0394 \u03bb . It is also noticed that f \u2113 \u2032 = f \u0303 \u2113 + 1 for a link \u2113 which belongs to p \u03bd \u2032 but not p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) . Therefore, from (20) we have \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 p \u03bd \u2032 , \u2113 \u2209 p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) C \u2113 ( f \u0303 \u2113 + 1 ) < \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) , \u2113 \u2209 p \u03bd \u2032 C \u2113 ( f \u0303 \u2113 ) - \u0394 \u03bb . This implies that (21) \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l \u2211 z = 0 f \u2032 \u2113 C \u2113 ( z ) = \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l \u2211 z = 0 f \u0303 \u2113 C \u2113 ( z ) + \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 p \u03bd \u2032 , \u2113 \u2209 p \u0303 \u03bd C \u2113 ( f \u0303 \u2113 + 1 ) - \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) , \u2113 \u2209 p \u03bd \u2032 C \u2113 ( f \u0303 \u2113 ) < \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l \u2211 z = 0 f \u0303 \u2113 C \u2113 ( z ) - \u0394 = \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l \u2211 z = 0 f \u2113 \u2217 C \u2113 ( z ) , which contradicts Theorem 1.\u25a1 Remark 6 Lemma 5 tells us that, if an equilibrium joint routing decision under the CRM-IP causes the objective value of the EIP \u223c \u03bb increases by \u0394 \u03bb from the objective value of the EIP, then under this joint routing decision, each vehicle can at most decrease their travel time by \u0394 \u03bb if they deviate to another path unilaterally. Notice that in the proof of Lemma 5, the fact that p \u0303 ( \u03bb ) is an equilibrium joint routing decision under CRM-IP is not used. In fact, the conclusion of Lemma 5 holds for any arbitrary joint routing decision. 4.3 Impact of information perturbation on system optimality Next this study investigates how much system optimality we can gain if we do lose some user optimality. By utilizing Lemma 5, we provide a lower bound for system performance improvement by the CRM-IP stated in Theorem 7. Theorem 7 For any \u03bb \u2208 [ 0 , 1 ] , let \u0394 \u03bb be the same as defined in Lemma 5. Let \u0393 \u03bb represents the corresponding difference of the system cost, i.e., (22) \u0393 \u03bb = \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l f \u2113 \u2217 C \u2113 ( f \u2113 \u2217 ) - \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l f \u0303 \u2113 ( \u03bb ) C \u2113 ( f \u0303 \u2113 ( \u03bb ) ) , where f \u2217 and f \u0303 are defined as before. It holds that \u0393 \u03bb \u2a7e 1 - \u03bb \u03bb \u0394 \u03bb . Proof First, according to (9) and (10), it is noticed that for any \u03bb and volume f, we have \u2211 z = 0 f C \u223c \u2113 , \u03bb ( z ) = \u2211 z = 0 f ( 1 - \u03bb ) C \u2113 ( z ) + \u2211 z = 0 f \u03bb C ^ \u2113 ( z ) = ( 1 - \u03bb ) \u2211 z = 0 f C \u2113 ( z ) + \u03bb fC \u2113 ( f ) , for any link \u2113 . For any \u03bb \u2208 ( 0 , 1 ] , since { p \u0303 \u03bd ( \u03bb ) } \u03bd = 1 m corresponds to a minimizer of EIP \u223c \u03bb , we have (23) \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l \u2211 z = 0 f \u0303 \u2113 C \u223c \u2113 , \u03bb ( z ) \u2a7d \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l \u2211 z = 0 f \u2113 \u2217 C \u223c \u2113 , \u03bb ( z ) \u21d2 \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l ( 1 - \u03bb ) \u2211 z = 0 f \u0303 \u2113 C \u2113 ( z ) + \u03bb f \u0303 \u2113 C \u2113 ( f \u0303 \u2113 ) \u2a7d \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l ( 1 - \u03bb ) \u2211 z = 0 f \u2113 \u2217 C \u2113 ( z ) + \u03bb f \u2113 \u2217 C \u2113 ( f \u2113 \u2217 ) \u21d2 \u03bb \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l f \u0303 \u2113 C \u2113 ( f \u0303 \u2113 ) - \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l f \u2113 \u2217 C \u2113 ( f \u2113 \u2217 ) \u2a7d ( 1 - \u03bb ) \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l \u2211 z = 0 f \u2113 \u2217 C \u2113 ( z ) - \u2211 \u2113 = 1 l \u2211 z = 0 f \u0303 \u2113 C \u2113 ( z ) . By the definitions of \u0393 \u03bb and \u0394 \u03bb , we rewrite (23) as below, (24) - \u03bb \u0393 \u03bb \u2a7d - ( 1 - \u03bb ) \u0394 \u03bb \u21d2 \u0393 \u03bb \u2a7e 1 - \u03bb \u03bb \u0394 \u03bb . This concludes the proof for Theorem 7.\u25a1 Remark 8 Lemma 5 tells us that if the CRM-IP (using some \u03bb) causes some vehicles to lose certain amount of user optimality, then the loss of user optimality is bounded by \u0394 \u03bb defined in Eq. (19). More importantly, Eq. (24) further indicates that the system performance will improve by at least 1 - \u03bb \u03bb \u0394 \u03bb . When \u03bb is small, this leverage rate is high. For example, when \u03bb = 0.05 , then 1 - \u03bb \u03bb = 19 , which means that by sacrificing a small amount of user optimality, we can gain at least 19 times the loss in system performance. This fact further justifies the perturbation approach proposed in this paper.\u25a1 5 Distributed algorithm for CRM-IP This study implemented the CRM-IP by the sequentially updating distributed algorithm (SUDA) developed in Du et al. (in press), but includes some minor modifications to adapt to this study. For the completeness of this paper, we present the procedure below but omit the proof of the convergence given in Du et al. (in press). Initialization: Each vehicle picks a route p \u0303 \u03c9 1 and then synchronizes For n = 1 , 2 \u2026 , If \u03c9 = mod ( n , m ) then vehicle \u03c9 finds the shortest path p \u0303 \u03c9 \u2217 , n . If the cost of p \u0303 \u03c9 \u2217 , n is strictly less than the cost of p \u0303 \u03c9 n then p \u0303 \u03c9 n + 1 \u2190 p \u0303 v \u2217 , n , otherwise, p \u0303 \u03c9 n + 1 \u2190 p \u0303 \u03c9 n . Synchronize. If convergence criterion is satisfied then exit. There are a few remarks that we want to make regarding the procedure of SUDA. Remark 9 (i) mod ( n , m ) means the remainder of the division n / m . It generates the index of a vehicle which will conduct route update in iteration n. (ii) The travel cost of p \u0303 \u03c9 \u2217 , n is computed based on the link cost c \u0303 \u2113 , n defined by Eq. (27). If the travel cost of p \u0303 \u03c9 \u2217 , n and p \u03c9 n are the same, then the vehicle does not change its route choice, otherwise, p \u0303 \u03c9 n + 1 \u2190 p \u0303 \u03c9 \u2217 , n . (iii) In the synchronization step, all other vehicles receive vehicle \u03c9\u2019s new route choice (could be the same as before though), either directly from vehicle \u03c9 or from a central information collection facility. Finding new route p \u03c9 \u2217 , n . At each iteration, only one vehicle is allowed to update its route choice through solving a shortest path problem, given all other vehicles\u2019 route choices are known and fixed. After a new route choice is made, this information will be proposed and shared with other vehicles instantaneously. Suppose at the current iteration n, it is vehicle \u03c9\u2019s turn to update its route; and current route choice of other vehicle \u03bd is given by p \u03bd n . Let y - \u03c9 \u2113 , n be the total number of vehicles choosing link \u2113 excluding \u03c9 itself, i.e., (25) f \u0303 - \u03c9 \u2113 , n = \u2211 \u03bd \u2260 \u03c9 y \u03bd \u2113 , n , where (26) y \u03bd \u2113 , n = 1 if \u2113 \u2208 p \u03bd n 0 otherwise . With information perturbation, the cost on each link \u2113 is given by (27) c \u0303 \u2113 , n = C \u223c \u2113 ( f \u0303 - \u03c9 \u2113 , n + 1 ) , and vehicle \u03c9 then finds a shortest path p \u03c9 \u2217 , n with the cost on each link \u2113 being c \u0303 \u2113 , n . Remark 10 Note that C \u223c \u2113 ( \u00b7 ) is used to calculate the link travel time. This is where information perturbation happens. In particular, while C \u2113 ( \u00b7 ) provides the \u201ctrue\u201d travel time, the CRM-IP intentionally provides a perturbed travel time for the smart vehicles to determine their next route proposal. The effects of this perturbation has been studied in the previous sections. The convergence of the SUDA using the unperturbed travel cost function has been proved in Du et al. (in press). This proof applies to the case when the travel cost function is perturbed also. Therefore, the proof of the latter case is omitted here. The convergence result is stated formally in the following lemma. Lemma 11 The proposed distributed algorithm converges to an equilibrium joint routing decision under the CRM-IP in a finite number of iterations. 6 Numerical experiments Previous sections proved the bounds on the absolute improvement/loss of system/user optimality by the CRM-IP in the worst case, while the average relative improvement/loss and traffic regimes are not considered since it is hard to perform rigorous discussion on them. This section, therefore, conducts numerical experiments to further investigate the relative effects of the CRM-IP under different information perturbation levels measured by \u03bb and different network traffic conditions, i.e., levels of service (LOS\u2019s). More exactly, the experiments have two objectives: (I) explore the relative system optimality improvement by the CRM-IP compared to the CRM; (II) disclose the effect of the CRM-IP on individual travelers, i.e., the percentage of users that can benefit from the CRM-IP compared to the CRM, and to what extent each user can benefit, as well as the percentage of users will sacrifice, and to what extent each user need to sacrifice by following the CRM-IP. Note that the computational performance (including computation load and convergence) of the SUDA has been investigated in Du et al. (in press), hence is not included in this study. 6.1 Experiment implementation The CRM-IP routing mechanism is implemented by the SUDA with the following setup details: (i) Sioux Falls city network is selected as the test bed, which incudes 24 nodes and 76 links. (ii) BPR function in (1) is used as the link travel time function with the parameters values: \u03b1 = 0.15 and \u03b2 = 4 . Free flow link travel time t \u2113 and link capacity C \u2113 are randomly generated in all experiments. Even though BRP function usually takes the flow (number of vehicle per unit time) as the variable, it is still applicable here since we assume that the vehicles are traversing the network in a fixed time period, the number/volume of vehicles can be easily converted to flow. (iii) Assume all vehicles in the network are smart vehicles following the CRM-IP, which are randomly generated with assigned O-D pairs. The load of smart vehicles in the experiments varies from 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 3250 to 4000 corresponding to average LOS over network changing from A to F. (iv) Information perturbation level (i.e., the value of \u03bb) increases from 0 to 1 with the step size equals to 0.05. Clearly, \u03bb = 0 and \u03bb = 1 represent the scenarios that experiments stop at a joint equilibrium routing resolution under the CRM and a system optimal routing solution led by the CRM-IP respectively. \u03bb \u2208 ( 0 , 1 ) leads to a resolution with the information perturbation. (v) The SUDA is implemented in MATLAB R2013a without employing any existing transportation simulation software. (vi) Bellman-Ford-Moore Shortest Path algorithm is applied for the shortest path searching. (vi) The experiments are run on a computer with processor: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CUP E5\u20132603 0@1.8GHz 1.8GHz and RAM: 16.0GB. (vii) Each scenario specified by the value of \u03bb and smart vehicle volume is conducted multiple times (\u2a7e10 runs) to remove the effect of randomness. 6.2 Effect on system optimality The experiments first focus on objective I: exploring the relative improvement of system optimality by the CRM-IP. The results in Fig. 1 indicate that under each traffic LOS, the percentage of system performance improvement gradually increases along with the increasing of information perturbation level \u03bb. If network traffic condition is under LOS D, the improvement of system performance from the CRM by the CRM-IP can reach around 2%. This improvement decreases to 1% under LOS\u2019s C, E and F, and becomes very small under LOS\u2019s A and B. These observations indicate that the information perturbation is more beneficial to improve system performance when traffic congestions are present but not extremely severe in the network such as LOS is D, E or C. This is consistent to the intuition that traffic system performance will not have a great potential to be further improved when network traffic is extremely congested (such as LOS F) or sparse (such as LOS A and B). Moreover, it is noticed that the CRM-IP under the scenario of \u03bb \u2a7e 0.1 generates very good network system performance that is at most around 1% worse than optimal system performance ( \u03bb = 1 ). Also, for all LOS\u2019s, when the information perturbation level is low, the marginal benefit is relatively high. Thus, \u03bb \u2a7e 0.1 is recommended information perturbation levels here. 6.3 Effect on individual users This study next moves to objective II: disclosing the effects of the CRM-IP on individual vehicles from two perspectives: (II.a) how many and how much individual users will benefit from the CRM-IP compared to the CRM; (II.b) how many and how much individual users will sacrifice by following the CRM-IP compared to the CRM. Note that Theorem 3 provides a theoretical upper bound on how much individual users need to sacrifice by complying the CRP-IP suggested route. However, it is a worst-case analysis, therefore can sometimes be too conservative. In the numerical experiments, the average loss of user optimality across users and different scenarios is the focus. The experiment results in Figs. 2 and 3 present our findings for (II.a). Fig. 2 demonstrates how many users will benefit from CRM-IP. The results indicate that a significant percentage of users will benefit from the CRM-IP under different LOS\u2019s from A to F. With the same level of information perturbation, the percentage of users experiencing travel time reduction from the CRM by the CRM-IP presents a decreasing order from LOS\u2019s D, E, C, F, B, to A. This order demonstrates that the effect of the CRM-IP on individual users is more apparent under mildly congested flow (LOS\u2019s D, E, and C) than under extremely congested (LOS F) or sparse flow (LOS\u2019s A and B). The positive effects of the CRM-IP on individual users and system optimality is similar and they both are consistent to our intuition. Moreover, Fig. 2 shows that along with the increasing of the perturbation level \u03bb, the benefit from CRM-IP presents an apparently increasing trend under sparse traffic, but a weak parabolic shape (increasing first and then slightly decreasing after a point) under mildly or highly congested network traffic conditions. This observation tells that sparse traffic provides relatively more space for the CRM-IP to perturb information, which positively influences traffic load distribution over network and benefit more users; however, as traffic congestions are present, higher information perturbation may not lead to further improvement. Fig. 3 demonstrates how much a vehicle can benefit from the CRM-IP in terms of travel time reduction. The results demonstrate that on average vehicles will always have travel time reduction from the CRM by the CRM-IP but to different extents (from about 5% under LOS\u2019s D and E to less than 1% under LOS A). More exactly, a higher percentage of travel time reduction happens under highly (LOS F) or mildly congested network traffic conditions (LOS\u2019s D, E, C) than under free and sparse traffic (LOS A and LOS B). This observation is rational since the room to further reduce individual user\u2019s travel time is limited if the overall network is under free flow. It is more beneficial to adopt the CRM-IP which distributes traffic load with the consideration of system performance, thus benefits some vehicles on the travel time reduction, if the overall network is under mildly congested condition. Moreover, Fig. 3 indicates that a higher level of information perturbation will bring more travel time reduction under each traffic LOS, but the reduction rate is more prominent under a congested traffic condition than a free flow traffic condition. This observation reinsures the good characteristics of the CRM-IP: it benefits more significantly under congested network conditions than free flow traffic conditions. The experiment results presented in Figs. 4 and 5 present our findings for (II.b). Fig. 4 shows that as the information perturbation level increases, more vehicles need to sacrifice by following the CRM-IP. It means that they could better off by deviating from the route suggested by the CRM-IP route unilaterally. The percentage of sacrificing vehicles is higher for LOS\u2019s E, F and D, reaching above 20% when \u03bb is close to 1, compared to other LOS\u2019s. On the other hand, Fig. 5 shows that, even thought there are non-neglectable amount of vehicles that will sacrifice by following the CRM-IP strategy, the extent of their sacrifice on travel time is relatively small. In particular, Fig. 5 shows that a vehicle, if does sacrifice by following the CRM-IP route, can on average at most reduce its travel time by less than 6% by deviating from the CRM-IP strategy even if the information perturbation level is very high (\u03bb close to 1). When the information perturbation is at a lower level, the extent of their sacrifice is even smaller. For example, when \u03bb = 0.1 , the vehicles can on average reduce their travel time by at most 2% by not following the CRM-IP strategy for all different LOS. Due to the bounded rationality of users, we can consider that most of vehicles will follow the CRM-IP strategy. Hence, from benefiting user optimality point of view, \u03bb = 0.1 is a recommended information perturbation level for this case study. Overall, our experiments show that the CRM-IP pertains a great potential to benefit/balance user optimality and system optimality. Especially, \u03bb = 0.1 seems to be a very good choice of information perturbation level. Namely, the CRM-IP will lead to a desired system performance (i.e., system travel time is very close to system optimal (at most 1% worse)), while causes a small proportion of vehicles comprise slightly on individual travel time. 7 Conclusion and future work One of the main difficulties for roadway traffic congestion management/control is the conflict between user optimality and system optimality due to the selfish and self-driven driving behaviors. Recent integration of advanced wireless communication and portable computation capability into vehicles provides more accesses for traffic controllers to affect individual vehicles\u2019 online driving decisions so that desired system performance can be approached. Motivated by this view, Du et al. (in press) proposed the CRM which seeks to build up the coordination among smart vehicles\u2019s online routing decisions. Even though experimental results indicates the CRM has a great potential to improve system optimality from IRM, system optimality is not explicitly considered, thus is not sustained yet. In other words, the effect of the CRM on system optimality is unclear and it is not under control. To makeup this deficiency, the proposed research represents a significant progress along the line of the CRM initiated in Du et al. (in press). Specifically, this study proposes the CRM-IP, explicitly considering user optimality and system optimality by exploiting bounded rationality of the users. Moreover, the presented research rigorously proves that the CRM-IP is able to artfully balances user optimality and system optimality. The mathematical bounds are given to capture the absolute gain of the system optimality and the relative loss of user optimally due to certain level of information perturbation. Furthermore, the numerical experiments conducted on Sioux Falls city network further demonstrate the relative effects of the CRM-IP on system performance and individual users as well as several good qualities of the CRM-IP. The important insights are summarized as follows. (i) The CRM-IP will lead to system performance improvement and make significant percentage of individual users have considerable percentage of travel time reduction from the CRM under various traffic conditions. The effect is more significant when the network traffic is under a mildly congested state such as LOS\u2019s C, D, and E rather than the network traffic is under extremely sparse or congested states such as LOS\u2019s A and B, or F. (ii) Even though the high level of information perturbation likely benefits system performance more, the marginal effect will decrease after some point such as \u03bb = 0.1 in this case study. Hence, this study suggests that a small information perturbation will lead to satisfied system performance improvement. (iii) By following the CRM-IP, some vehicles may sacrifice in route travel time due to the information perturbation, but the sacrifice is not very significant, even though the extent of the sacrifice increases with the increasing of the information perturbation. (The maximum sacrifice is around 6% as \u03bb = 1 under LOS D and C in this case study). Overall, this study proposes the CRM-IP as an efficient routing mechanism, which has a great potential to improve traffic network performance as well as user travel experience.
