We find that such cooperation reduces traffic in markets where prior modal competition occurs, but may increase traffic in other markets of the network. The cooperation improves welfare, independent of whether or not the hub capacity is constrained, as long as the modal substitutability in the overlapping markets is low. However, if the modal substitutability is high, then hub capacity plays an important role in assessing the welfare impact: If the hub airports are significantly capacity-constrained, the cooperation improves welfare; otherwise, it is likely welfare reducing. Through simulations we further study the welfare effects of modal asymmetries in the demands and costs, heterogeneous passenger types, and economies of traffic density. Our analysis shows that the economies of traffic density alone cannot justify airline\u2013HSR cooperation.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    serial JL 271728 291210 291772 291817 31 Transportation Research Part B: Methodological TRANSPORTATIONRESEARCHPARTBMETHODOLOGICAL 2013-12-29 2013-12-29 2014-02-01T12:44:42 1-s2.0-S019126151300221X S0191-2615(13)00221-X S019126151300221X 10.1016/j.trb.2013.12.002 S300 S300.1 FULL-TEXT 1-s2.0-S0191261513X0013X 2015-05-14T05:39:52.915433-04:00 0 0 20140201 20140228 2014 2013-12-29T00:00:00Z articleinfo crossmark dco dateupdated tomb dateloaded datesearch indexeddate volumelist yearnav articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright dateloadedtxt docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdateend pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype subheadings suppl volfirst volissue webpdf webpdfpagecount figure table body mmlmath acknowledge affil appendices articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authkeywords authlast footnotes highlightsabst primabst ref alllist content subj ssids 0191-2615 01912615 true 60 60 C Volume 60 4 33 49 33 49 201402 February 2014 2014-02-01 2014-02-28 2014 article fla Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract This paper analyzes the effects of cooperation between a hub-and-spoke airline and a high-speed rail (HSR) operator when the hub airport may be capacity-constrained. We find that such cooperation reduces traffic in markets where prior modal competition occurs, but may increase traffic in other markets of the network. The cooperation improves welfare, independent of whether or not the hub capacity is constrained, as long as the modal substitutability in the overlapping markets is low. However, if the modal substitutability is high, then hub capacity plays an important role in assessing the welfare impact: If the hub airports are significantly capacity-constrained, the cooperation improves welfare; otherwise, it is likely welfare reducing. Through simulations we further study the welfare effects of modal asymmetries in the demands and costs, heterogeneous passenger types, and economies of traffic density. Our analysis shows that the economies of traffic density alone cannot justify airline\u2013HSR cooperation. Keywords High-speed rail Airline Cooperation Competition Hub airport capacity Traffic density 1 Introduction Since the first modern high-speed rail (HSR) began operation between Tokyo and Osaka, Japan in 1964, a number of countries including the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and South Korea have also successfully launched HSR lines. By 2012, China had the world\u2019s largest HSR network, amounting to 9300km of HSR coverage, with speeds between 200km and 350km per hour. In the United States, President Barack Obama\u2019s (fiscal year) 2012 budget allocated $8 billion for HSR development, representing the first installment of a six-year, $53 billion plan. As train speeds have increased over the years, HSR has been viewed as a de facto substitute and effective competitor of air transport, especially for routes with distances up to 1000km (e.g., Janic, 1993; Rothengatter, 2011). However, as pointed out by Givoni and Banister (2006), the relationship between HSR and air transport is far more complicated than pure competition alone. In particular, HSR can complement air service by offering connections between airports and nearby cities, and the potential for airline\u2013HSR cooperation exists due to the hub-and-spoke network adopted by most major airlines. Under hub-and-spoke operation, two flights (\u201clegs\u201d) are offered to passengers as one journey from their origin airport to the destination airport through a hub airport. With HSR, however, both these two legs need not be air flights: on legs where HSR service is comparable with flights in terms of (total) journey time and cost, HSR service may also be used in combination with a flight as one journey, with one booking for the entire two-leg trip. Such airline\u2013HSR cooperation may be viewed simply as a special type of \u201ccode sharing\u201d \u2013 i.e. two airlines cooperate to offer a hub-and-spoke operation with each offering one leg of a flight (and a non-operating carrier is allowed to put its code on the operating airline\u2019s flight number) \u2013 which has been a common practice in the airline industry (e.g. Oum et al., 1996; Brueckner, 2001; Ito and Lee, 2007; Gayle, 2008). There are several such airline\u2013HSR cooperations in Europe. The AIRail Service provided by Lufthansa and Deutsche Bahn has connected Frankfurt airport with Stuttgart since March 2001, and with Cologne since May 2003. Passengers purchase a single ticket for the entire trip, and the luggage coordination between the airline and the HSR enables the passengers to pick up their luggage at the final destination without worrying about the transfer problem. Onboard the train, Deutsche Bahn staff provides services comparable to the ones offered onboard European short-haul flights. In France, Air France and SNCF launched TGV AIR in 1994, under which the intermodal passenger transportation between Charles de Gaulle (CDG) and Lille is exclusively operated by TGV (all Air France flights are cancelled). The TGV journey has an associated flight number appearing in the airline\u2019s computer reservation system (CRS), but luggage check-in is not included in the intermodal service. Similarly, Thalys International has cooperated with several airlines (Air France, KLM, American Airlines, Lufthansa and SN Brussels) to provide intermodal services to passengers on three Thalys links, namely, Brussels-CDG, Anvers-Schiphol, and Paris (Nord)-Brussels National Airport. These agreements differ from TGV AIR in that travelers check in at the rail stations for the entire journey. In Switzerland, the Swiss railway operator, SBB, cooperates with Swiss Airlines and Finnair to offer an intermodal product, called FlugZug, which covers four destinations (Basel, Bern, Lausanne and Lucerne) beyond Zurich. This product is displayed on the airlines\u2019 CRSs such that it looks like a Swiss or Finnair \u201cflight.\u201d The traveler is \u201cthrough checked\u201d and obtains a boarding pass for the train leg of the journey. The service originally offered luggage through-check but the luggage transfer was stopped eventually due to under-utilization (Cokasova, 2006). While airline\u2013HSR cooperation has become more popular, overall it is still a relatively new phenomenon and so its market outcomes and welfare effects are largely unknown to date. Such cooperation can obviously hurt competition between the two modes in the markets where prior competition between the two occurs. A less obvious question is how such cooperation affects other \u201csecondary\u201d markets, owing to the network nature of a transportation system. The European Union appears to encourage such cooperation, stating in its White Paper that \u201cnetwork planning should therefore seek to take advantage of the ability of HSR to replace air transport and encourage rail companies, airlines and airport managers not just to compete, but also to cooperate\u201d (European Commission, 2001); no rigorous analysis was given however. In the existing literature the two main arguments in favor of airline\u2013HSR cooperation are (1) the relief of congestion at some major airports subject to capacity constraints and (2) the reduction of environmental pollutions (Givoni and Banister, 2006; Socorro and Viecens, 2013), as HSR service can divert airport traffic and is further considered a cleaner mode of transportation than air service, on a per-passenger basis. The arguments are made largely qualitatively with the use of empirical observations. The present paper investigates analytically air transport\u2013HSR interactions so as to address the impact of airline\u2013HSR cooperation on market outcome and social welfare. Our investigation incorporates some of the most salient features of the two modes: in addition to an explicit examination of potential hub airport capacity constraints, we consider modal asymmetries in the demands and costs, heterogeneous passenger types, and economies of traffic density. Such an exercise is important because airline\u2013HSR cooperation can involve substantial investment in access/connecting facilities and management time and effort. A better understanding of its impact is necessary and timely given that China is developing HSR quite ambitiously and countries like Brazil, India, Russia, Turkey, the UK and the US are evaluating the options of investing in HSR (Fu et al., 2012). We show that airline\u2013HSR cooperation will, as expected, reduce traffic in the markets where prior competition between the partners occurs, but may increase traffic in other markets of the network. The cooperation would improve social welfare, independent of whether or not the hub capacity is constrained, as long as the substitutability between air service and HSR service in the overlapping markets is low. However, if the modal substitutability is high (and hence the negative effect from dampening competition becomes larger), then hub capacity plays an important role in assessing the welfare impact. If the hub airports are significantly capacity-constrained, then airline\u2013HSR cooperation could help alleviate the constrained capacity and benefit passengers in the non-overlapping markets of the network, leading to a net welfare improvement. Otherwise, the cooperation should be carefully examined, owing to its likely welfare-reducing effect. Through simulations we further find that airline\u2013HSR cooperation is welfare enhancing irrespective of the hub capacity level if any one of the following conditions holds: (1) the unit cost of the HSR operator is sufficiently lower than that of the airline; (2) the HSR service is sufficiently superior to that of the airline; (3) the price sensitivity of HSR demand is higher than that of airline demand; and (4) a sufficiently large proportion of the passengers are business passengers. Our analysis shows that the economies of traffic density alone cannot justify airline\u2013HSR cooperation. Moreover, when the density effect in the air sector is strong, the cooperation is less likely to be welfare enhancing under hub capacity constraints; but when the density effect in the rail sector is strong, this cooperation is more likely to improve welfare. The existing literature focuses mainly on the competition aspect of the airline\u2013HSR interaction. For example, Gonzalez-Savignat (2004) indicates that HSR service significantly reduces the market share of air transport when the two modes compete head-on. Park and Ha (2006) find that the opening of the first HSR line in South Korea has a significant (negative) impact on the domestic air transport industry. Adler et al. (2010) use a game theory setting to analyze aviation\u2013HSR competition in the medium- to long-distance transport markets. They conclude that the European Union should encourage the development of the HSR network across Europe. With a Hotelling (differentiated Bertrand) model in which the HSR\u2019s objective is to maximize a weighted sum of welfare and profit, Yang and Zhang (2012) show that both airfare and HSR fare fall as the weight on welfare rises, and that airfare decreases, and HSR fare increases, in the airport access time. Behrens and Pels (2012) use pooled cross-sectional data from the London-Paris passenger market to identify the degree to and conditions under which HSR is a viable substitute for airline travel. They show empirically that there is fierce competition between aviation and HSR, and that the frequency of trips offered, total travel time and distance to the UK port are the main determinants of travelers\u2019 behavior in terms of their modal choice. Research on airline\u2013HSR cooperation is relatively rare in the literature, and is composed mostly of case studies and simulations. 1 This is in contrast to a large literature gauging the impacts of airline code sharing: International code-sharing alliances have been analyzed by, e.g., Oum et al. (1996), Brueckner and Whalen (2000), Brueckner (2001) and Whalen (2007). For analysis of US domestic airline alliances see, e.g., Clougherty (2000), Bamberger et al. (2004), Ito and Lee (2007), Gayle (2008) and Armantier and Richard (2008). 1 Using the case of London\u2019s Heathrow airport, Givoni and Banister (2006) examine the possibility of airline\u2013HSR intermodal integration and its potential benefits for airlines and the society. Cokasova (2006) undertakes a microscopic (operational) passenger and baggage movement simulation at an airline\u2013HSR intermodal airport terminal to analyze the impact of intermodal passenger flow on such factors as passenger throughput and passenger delays. The simulation results show that intermodal passenger movement is socially beneficial only at airports with a large volume of short-haul frequent traffic, but the intermodal movement nonetheless increases the level of passenger delays. Socorro and Viecens\u2019s (2013) paper is the only attempt besides ours to investigate the impact of airline\u2013HSR intermodal cooperation from an analytical point of view. They show that at capacity-constrained airports airline\u2013HSR integration will reduce airport traffic and thereby relieve hub airport capacity (and reduce aircraft emissions), but the overall effect of the integration on welfare is ambiguous. While Socorro and Viecens\u2019s work is the most relevant to ours, they model hub airport capacity in a specific manner and make strong assumptions about the airlines\u2019 priorities for different markets. In particular, they assume that the airlines have a given order of importance for different markets, and fulfill all demands in one market before they consider the demands in another market. We adopt a different framework in which we are able to endogenize the airlines\u2019 decisions of allocating hub airport capacity to different markets, and hence avoid assuming that some markets are exogenously more important than others. In addition, we study the impact of some important features including economies of traffic density, vertical differentiation between modes, difference in price sensitivity of demand and heterogeneous passenger types, which were not addressed in Socorro and Viecens (2013). To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first analytical work that uses an endogenous decision-making framework to study the effects of airline\u2013HSR cooperation with a specific consideration of hub airport capacity and other salient features of the two transport modes. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets up the basic model and characterizes our analytical benchmark (the competition case). Section 3 examines the effects of airline\u2013HSR cooperation on traffic and welfare, focusing on the role of hub airport capacity. Section 4 extends, using simulation analysis, the welfare analysis to situations with modal asymmetries in the demands and costs, heterogeneous passenger types, and economies of traffic density. Section 5 contains concluding remarks. 2 Model 2.1 Basic setting Consider a network structure in which there are three cities with inter-city transport services being offered on only two links. The situation is depicted in Fig. 1 , with three cities N1, N2 and N3. One link, N1N2, is operated only by an air carrier; while the other, N2N3, is served by both the airline and an HSR operator. The different market structures on the two links may be due to geographical reasons. For instance, the first link is a long-haul journey and can be competitively served only by airlines, whilst the second link is short-haul with no distinct journey time difference between flights and HSR service. 2 Janic (1993) and Rothengatter (2011), among others, find that fierce competition between HSR and air transport can occur on links with distances up to 1000km, most likely between 400km and 800km. HSR in general has little competitive impact on airlines for routes longer than 1200km. 2 It is also possible that cities N1 and N2 are separated by water or mountains, thus making HSR access technologically challenging. An example would be Morocco and Spain, which are not far away from each other in terms of distance but are separated by the Strait of Gibraltar, resulting in no train service between the two countries. 3 In some cases, geographical obstacles may be overcome by technologies like the Channel Tunnel, but these cases are rare since the infrastructures are extremely expensive to build. Note that the different market structures on the two links might be due to political or technological factors also. For example, the air-only link connects two cities located in different countries, as international train service will likely impose a much higher level of cooperation between the two countries in laws, customs, and rail track compatibility. 3 While relevant practically, this transportation network is also likely the simplest structure in which HSR\u2013airline cooperation under hub airport capacity constraint can be addressed. It contains not only the market in which HSR and air transport directly compete prior to their cooperation but also other markets which, as we shall show, will be affected by such cooperation owing to strategic interactions in a transportation network. 4 This network structure is similar to the airline networks examined in, e.g., Brueckner and Spiller (1991) and Oum et al. (1995). 4 With three cities there are in total three origin\u2013destination (OD) markets, which are N1N2, N2N3 and N1N3. As indicated above, the N1N2 market is served only by the airline (hereafter, the HSR-inaccessible market), whereas the N2N3 market is served by both the airline and the HSR (hereafter, the HSR-accessible market). In addition, the air carrier serves the N1N3 market using a hub-and-spoke strategy with N2 as its hub. That is, it carries passengers from N1 to N3 (and back) through hub N2 and so there is no direct flight service in the N1N3 market (hereafter, the connecting market). This structure is treated as exogenous for two reasons. First, major (legacy) carriers have adopted the hub-and-spoke strategy since the advent of deregulation (e.g., Zhang et al., 2011), which is long before HSR became a legitimate competitor to airlines. Competition from HSR, important and noteworthy as it is, does not appear to have forced airlines to change their networks from hub-and-spoke to \u201cpoint-to-point\u201d. 5 To our knowledge, there is no reported case of airline de-hubbing as a result of HSR competition. Fu et al. (2012) state that an effective hub-and-spoke network is a way to confront HSR competition, suggesting that even if an airline network were influenced by HSR competition, it would be from a point-to-point network to a hub-and-spoke network, not the other way around. 5 Second, the factors considered in this paper, including hub airport capacity constraint and economies of traffic density, will only be significant under a hub-and-spoke network. This is because the economies of traffic density are a major reason why airlines adopt hub-and-spoke in the first place (e.g., Hendricks et al., 1995; Oum et al., 1995) and hub airports usually encounter capacity constraints owing to their \u201cconnecting\u201d function (e.g., Ball et al., 2010). Following Singh and Vives (1984) we use a quadratic consumer utility function: (1) U = \u2211 i \u2211 j \u03b1 i j q i j - 1 2 \u2211 i \u2211 j \u03b2 i j q i j 2 + 2 \u03b3 \u220f j q i j where i =1, 2, 3 indicates the three OD markets (1 for N1N2, 2 for N2N3, and 3 for N1N3), whereas j indicates the transportation products. Specifically, only air service is available in the N1N2 market, so j = A when i =1 (A for air service). With both air flights and HSR service being provided in the N2N3 market, j = A or R when i =2 (R for HSR service). The connecting market (N1N3) requires special attention, since its market structure will be different under the two scenarios (competition and cooperation) investigated in this paper. We assume that when the airline and the HSR operator are pure competitors, a connecting flight is the only product available in this market; but if the airline cooperates with the HSR operator, passengers can choose connecting flight or flight\u2013HSR connecting service to complete their journeys. In other words, j = AA when i =3 under airline\u2013HSR competition (AA for connecting flight), but j = AA or AR when i =3 under airline\u2013HSR cooperation (AR for flight\u2013HSR connecting service). The assumption corresponds to the observation that cooperation between the two modes can significantly increase attractiveness of the flight\u2013HSR connecting service by integrating tickets, coordinating schedules, providing connections between airports and train stations and possibly streamlining baggage transfer. As a consequence, passengers could treat it as a valid alternative to the connecting-flight service (Cokasova, 2006; Grimme, 2007). Specification (1) implies that air service and HSR service are horizontally differentiated in the same market. This is justifiable by noting that for passengers the most important quality differentiator between the two modes is total journey time (e.g., Cokasova, 2006; Behrens and Pels, 2012). As analyzed in Yang and Zhang (2012), although air service results in a lower travel time for most routes, passengers in general need to spend more access/egress time for a flight, owing to its complicated check-in and security-check procedures as well as to the fact that airports are usually located far away from city centers. As a result, the total journey times of the two modes may vary across different passengers due to the access/egress times. Specifically, we consider that the two services are (imperfect) substitutes in the HSR-accessible market and the degree of substitutability is captured by parameter \u03b3, with \u03b3 \u220a[0,1] and larger values of \u03b3 indicating more substitutable services. For simplicity we first assume, in Sections 2 and 3, \u03b1 i j = \u03b1 and \u03b2 i j = 1 across all i\u2019s and j\u2019s. Note that \u03b1 i j measures service quality in a vertical sense, so the case of the two modes being vertically differentiated is abstracted away from the analysis. (We will relax these assumptions and consider, in Section 4, the case in which \u03b1 i j and \u03b2 i j are heterogeneous across the modes.) In the analysis, the common parameter \u03b1is used to represent the market size. 6 Another (and more accurate) interpretation of \u03b1 is the \u201chighest willingness-to-pay\u201d of passengers in a particular market, given that it is the intercept of the inverse demand functions. The intercept of the demand functions is the real \u201cmarket size\u201d. These two are identical for a monopoly market, but are slightly different for an oligopoly market. For a duopoly market, the real \u201cmarket size\u201d is \u03b1/(1+ \u03b3), which is related not only to \u03b1 but also to substitutability factor \u03b3. Overall these two concepts are closely related and can be used interchangeably. 6 Following Yang and Zhang (2012), we further consider that the airline and the HSR operator choose quantities to maximize their profits. That is, the two modes engage in Cournot competition, taking airport and other capacities as given. This is, in a sense, a direct consequence of our intention for the model to be short run (in which case assuming Cournot competition would probably be more appropriate, because of capacity constraints) rather than long run (in which case Bertrand competition would probably be more appropriate). 7 There are some good reasons to believe that quantity competition might be more realistic than price competition in the present case. First, Quinet and Vickerman (2004, p. 263) note: \u201cThe general idea which emerges from the theoretical analysis is that when transport capacities are high, or can be enlarged through the transfer of capacity from other locations, and the services provided are not differentiated, then competition is likely to be of a Bertrand type, based on price. \u2026If, on the other hand, capacity is difficult to increase, then competition is likely to be of a Cournot type, based on quantities. This is the case found, for example, in rail, maritime or inland waterway transport.\u201d The main reason why high-speed rail capacity is difficult to change (relative to the ease and rapidity with which prices can be adjusted) is that its investment is lumpy, time-consuming and irreversible. Second, Brander and Zhang (1990, 1993), for example, find some empirical evidence that rivalry between duopoly airlines is consistent with Cournot behavior. We discuss the issue further in the concluding remarks. 7 Another issue we need to address is the feasible range of parameter combinations. Here feasibility requires three groups of conditions: (1) the non-negativity conditions for (equilibrium) traffic volumes, prices, profits, marginal costs and marginal revenues; (2) the second-order conditions held for each maximization problem; and (3) the stability conditions of Cournot equilibrium. For the cases considered in Sections 2 and 3, feasibility does not impose any extra bounds for the parameters under consideration. However, it does play a role when other features (e.g., economies of traffic densities) are taken into account in Section 4. 2.2 Benchmark case: modal competition With passengers\u2019 maximizing utility subject to budget constraint, it is straightforward to obtain the inverse demand functions for the three markets. Under the competition scenario, these functions are given by (2) p 1 A = \u03b1 - q 1 A (3) p 2 A = \u03b1 - q 2 A - \u03b3 q 2 R (4) p 2 R = \u03b1 - q 2 R - \u03b3 q 2 A (5) p 3 AA = \u03b1 - q 3 AA Further, the airline\u2019s maximization problem is given as, (6) max { q 1 A , q 2 A , q 3 AA } \u03c0 A = p 1 A q 1 A + p 2 A q 2 A + p 3 AA q 3 AA - C 1 A ( q 1 A + q 3 AA ) - C 2 A ( q 2 A + q 3 AA ) s . t . q 1 A + q 2 A + 2 q 3 AA \u2a7d K where K denotes the hub airport capacity, which may be fully utilized; the superscripts of the cost functions ( C 1 A and C 2 A ) denote the operator (the same apply to the following expression for HSR) and the subscripts denote the links (1 for N1N2 and 2 for N2N3). Similarly, the problem of the HSR operator is given as, (7) max q 2 R \u03c0 R = p 2 R q 2 R - C 2 R ( q 2 R ) Social welfare is given by the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. In this benchmark case it is equal to (\u201chat\u201d denoting the values of variables in the competition case): (8) W ^ = CS ^ + \u03c0 \u02c6 A + \u03c0 \u02c6 R The consumer surplus is given by (9) CS ^ = \u03b1 ( q \u02c6 1 A + q \u02c6 2 A + q \u02c6 2 R + q \u02c6 3 AA ) - 1 2 ( q \u02c6 1 A 2 + q \u02c6 2 A 2 + q \u02c6 2 R 2 + q \u02c6 3 AA 2 + 2 \u03b3 q \u02c6 2 A q \u02c6 2 R ) - ( p \u02c6 1 A q \u02c6 1 A + p \u02c6 2 A q \u02c6 2 A + p \u02c6 2 R q \u02c6 2 R + p \u02c6 3 AA q \u02c6 3 AA ) For simplicity we first assume away cost asymmetry and the economies of traffic density: C i A ( Q ) = c A Q ( i = 1 , 2 ) , C 2 R ( Q ) = c R Q and cA = cR = cH , which is, without loss of generality, further normalized to be cH =0. A more complete analysis incorporating the modal cost asymmetry and economies of traffic density in both modes will be presented in Section 4. The consideration of capacity in a multi-market network problem may cause diversity in market structure, owing to potential market abandoning. More specifically, when the hub capacity is very limited, it is possible for the airline to abandon one or more markets such that the resources are used to serve the most profitable markets. In our model, the connecting market would be the first market to be relinquished by the airline when the hub capacity constraint reaches a certain level, given that serving this market imposes the highest opportunity cost. Here it is reasonable to assume that such withdrawal does not affect the demand functions of the other two markets. The assumption is needed to guarantee consistent and tractable analytical results that cover the entire feasible range of hub airport capacity. 8 The cost structure is also assumed to be unaffected by the airline\u2019s withdrawal from any of the markets, which is reasonable since the fixed cost an airline needs to pay for a specific link is relatively small and so its decision of entering or exiting a market is fairly flexible even in the short run. 8 It is also worth noting that whether the hub airport faces capacity constraint is determined not only by the capacity level but also by the market size. In effect, the Cournot equilibrium, characterized by the first-order conditions of problems (6) and (7), depends on the ratio of capacity over market size. We denote this ratio as k (k = K/\u03b1) and present, in Table 1 , the equilibrium traffic and welfare levels for different ranges of k under the competition scenario. 9 A technical appendix with detailed derivation that gives rise to Table 1 (and the subsequent tables) is available upon request from the authors. 9 Comparative statics analysis of the equilibrium traffic volumes in Table 1 gives rise to: Proposition 1 At the Cournot equilibrium (the competition scenario), (1) the number of passengers carried by the airline (non-strictly) increases with the hub capacity in all three markets, while the number of passengers carried by the HSR (non-strictly) decreases with the hub capacity. (2) If substitutability between air service and HSR service rises, then the number of passengers carried by the airline (non-strictly) increases in both the HSR-inaccessible market and the connecting market but (non-strictly) decreases in the HSR-accessible market, while the number of passengers carried by the HSR increases if the hub capacity is at a relatively low level, decreases if the hub capacity is at a relatively high level, and first falls and then rises for the middle capacity level. Part 1 of the proposition is intuitive. Under the (binding) hub capacity constraint an increase in capacity K raises the airline\u2019s (equilibrium) outputs in all three markets, noting that at equilibrium the marginal profit from each additional unit of hub capacity is equalized across all the markets. The airline\u2019s commitment to greater output in the HSR-accessible market would induce an output contraction by the rival HSR, since the firms\u2019 outputs are strategic substitutes under the quantity competition with linear demands and costs. The second part of Proposition 1 is concerned with the comparative statics with respect to air\u2013HSR substitutability. When the substitutability is higher, the rivalry in the HSR-accessible market is more intense, and the airline\u2019s profit margin in the market becomes lower as a result. The airline thus allocates more resources to the other two markets, increasing its outputs in these two markets and decreasing its output in the HSR-accessible market. The impact of a higher substitutability on the HSR operator is twofold: on the one hand, the more fierce the rivalry, the less output it would provide. On the other hand, due to the hub capacity constraint the airline is less aggressive in its rivalry with the HSR than it would have been without the constraint, which induces the HSR operator to act more aggressively. If the hub capacity is not too limited, the second effect is dominated by the first, leading to the HSR serving fewer passengers when the substitutability is higher. However, when the hub airport is seriously short of capacity, the second effect can become so strong that it dominates the first effect. In that case, the HSR\u2019s output is greater as the substitutability is higher. 3 Effects of airline\u2013HSR cooperation The competition case serves as a useful base for comparison with the case of airline\u2013HSR cooperation. Here we consider full-scale cooperation between the airline and the HSR, under which the two firms make decisions jointly to maximize their total profit. 10 Lower levels of cooperation also exist. As discussed in the introduction, airline-HSR cooperation exhibits various degrees of collaboration ranging from simple code sharing to joint schedule planning, single check-in and through baggage transfer. In these situations one firm could maximize its own profit and a fraction of its partner\u2019s profit (as in, e.g., Zhang and Zhang, 2006), and levels of cooperation could arise endogenously. The main insights obtained here can be extended to the partial cooperation cases as well. 10 Under this cooperation scenario, the demand functions become: (10) p 1 A = \u03b1 - q 1 A (11) p 2 A = \u03b1 - q 2 A - \u03b3 q 2 R (12) p 2 R = \u03b1 - q 2 R - \u03b3 q 2 A (13) p 3 AA = \u03b1 - q 3 AA - \u03b3 q 3 AR (14) p 3 AR = \u03b1 - q 3 AR - \u03b3 q 3 AA Note that Eqs. (10)\u2013(12) are the same as Eqs. (2)\u2013(4) as the cooperation will not alter the demand structures in the HSR-inaccessible market and the HSR-accessible market. The partners\u2019 problem is thus given by: (15) max { q 1 A , q 2 A , q 3 AA , q 2 R , q 3 AR } \u03c0 AR = p 1 A q 1 A + p 2 A q 2 A + p 2 R q 2 R + p 3 AA q 3 AA + p 3 AR q 3 AR - C 1 A ( q 1 A + q 3 AA + q 3 AR ) - C 2 A ( q 2 A + q 3 AA ) - C 2 R ( q 2 R + q 3 AR ) s . t . q 1 A + q 2 A + q 3 AR + 2 q 3 AA \u2a7d K It is assumed, again (in this section), that C i A ( Q ) = c A Q ( i = 1 , 2 ) , C 2 R ( Q ) = c R Q , cA = cR = cH and cH =0. 11 It can be easily seen that the total profit under cooperation will not be lower than that under competition, and so the airline and the HSR have incentives to cooperate. 11 Consumer surplus and social welfare are, respectively, expressed as (\u201cbar\u201d denoting the values of variables in the cooperation case): (16) CS \u203e = \u03b1 ( q \u00af 1 A + q \u00af 2 A + q \u00af 2 R + q \u00af 3 AA + q \u00af 3 AR ) - 1 2 ( q \u00af 1 A 2 + q \u00af 2 A 2 + q \u00af 2 R 2 + q \u00af 3 AA 2 + q \u00af 3 AR 2 + 2 \u03b3 q \u00af 2 A q \u00af 2 R + 2 \u03b3 q \u00af 3 AA q \u00af 3 AR ) - ( p \u00af 1 A q \u00af 1 A + p \u00af 2 A q \u00af 2 A + p \u00af 2 R q \u00af 2 R + p \u00af 3 AA q \u00af 3 AA + p \u00af 3 AR q \u00af 3 AR ) (17) W \u203e = CS \u203e + \u03c0 \u00af AR The (equilibrium) traffic and welfare levels in the cooperation case are summarized in Table 2 . It can be easily seen from the table that Proposition 1 holds largely for the cooperation case as well. The only difference is in the connecting market, due to the introduction of the flight\u2013HSR connecting service. When \u03b3 is small, the number of passengers taking the joint flight\u2013HSR service increases with the hub capacity level; but when \u03b3 is sufficiently large, this number first rises and then falls. The flight\u2013HSR connecting service is special because its provision requires the services of both the airline and the HSR operator. On one hand, the larger the hub capacity, the larger the number of passengers the airline can serve, raising the flight\u2013HSR connecting traffic. On the other hand, an increase in the hub capacity will increase the number of connecting flight passengers, which in turn will reduce the amount of flight\u2013HSR connecting traffic through a substitutability effect. When \u03b3 is large, the substitutability effect dominates the pure capacity effect, so the flight\u2013HSR connecting traffic falls. For this reason, the fall will only happen when the hub capacity is large enough to support both the connecting flights and the flight\u2013HSR connecting service. It should be noted that although Tables 1 and 2 cover all possible values of the airport capacity/market size ratio, it does not necessarily mean that these ranges are equally important. For instance, the situations when the hub airport is extremely capacity-constrained, which correspond to the first few rows in both tables, may not be very common in reality. Even if new terminals or new airports cannot be built due to certain reasons, alternative infrastructure solutions would be proposed and passenger behavior is also likely to adapt accordingly even in the short run. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to pay more attention to the bottom parts of the two tables. Bearing this in mind can be helpful for the interpretation of the tables. With Tables 1 and 2, we are able to compare the two scenarios and draw conclusions about the impact of the airline\u2013HSR cooperation on traffic volumes and welfare. The details are presented in Tables A1 and A2 (see Appendix A). The comparison first reveals underlying reasons for the diversified market forms observed in real-world airline\u2013HSR cooperation projects. 12 For example, ever since Air France and SNCF cooperated, all Air France flights between Lille to Charles de Gaulle have been cancelled, with only TGV train service being available on the route. However, passengers travelling between Frankfort and Stuttgart can choose a Lufthansa flight or a Deutsche Bahn train to complete their trips, despite the fact that these two companies have formed a close cooperative relationship in this market. In fact, both services can be purchased from the Lufthansa website. 12 In particular, the market form/product choice following airline\u2013HSR cooperation could depend on the hub capacity level also (rather than just on the degree of cooperation). We summarize the effects of the airline\u2013HSR cooperation in two propositions, one for traffic volumes (Proposition 2) and the other for welfare levels (Proposition 3): Proposition 2 The airline\u2013HSR cooperation will (non-strictly) reduce traffic in the HSR-accessible market and strictly increase traffic in the connecting market. Furthermore, it can increase or decrease traffic in the HSR-inaccessible market. It is noted that the effect of the airline\u2013HSR cooperation on traffic in the HSR-inaccessible market depends on the value of substitutability parameter \u03b3. For example, if \u03b3 is sufficiently large, q 1 A in the third row of Table A1 always rises following the cooperation, and q 1 A in the fourth row of Table A1 rises for large k but falls for small k. But for small \u03b3, q 1 A in the third row increases when k is large and decreases when k is small, whilst q 1 A in the fourth row always decreases. This reflects the impact of cooperation on resource reallocation. When air and HSR services are close substitutes, the cooperation will significantly reduce the airline\u2019s output in the HSR-accessible market, freeing up a large amount of hub capacity, which can be used in the HSR-inaccessible market. Thus traffic in the HSR-inaccessible market tends to rise for a large range of hub capacity levels when substitutability between the two modes is high. For the other two markets however, the results are clear-cut. In the HSR-accessible market, traffic will fall because of the dampening of competition following the airline\u2013HSR cooperation. In the connecting market, traffic always rises due to two reasons: first, the demand rises with the availability of the flight\u2013HSR connecting service. Second, the hub capacity is reallocated from the HSR-accessible market to the connecting market, thus relieving its input constraint and increasing connecting traffic. Proposition 3 The airline\u2013HSR cooperation improves welfare if either substitutability between air service and HSR service is sufficiently low, or the hub airport faces a severe capacity constraint. It reduces welfare, otherwise. Fig. 2 provides a graphical representation of Proposition 3. Instead of investigating the impact of the absolute level of hub capacity, K, on welfare, we introduce a measure of the relative hub capacity level as \u03c3K = K/Km , where Km denotes the minimum capacity level required for the hub airport to be not capacity-constrained. 13 Note that Km depends on substitutability parameter \u03b3 and market-size parameter \u03b1, so a certain value of K might be either sufficient or insufficient under different combinations of \u03b3 and \u03b1. Since it is the airport capacity discrepancy (rather than the airport capacity itself) that drives the implications of the airline\u2013HSR cooperation, \u03b1K is a more appropriate index for discussing if the hub is capacity-constrained or not. 13 Fig. 2 shows a threshold of substitutability parameter \u03b3 (i.e., the vertical demarcation line at \u03b3 =0.7) that divides the welfare comparison into two parts. On its left side, the airline\u2013HSR cooperation improves welfare regardless of hub capacity level \u03c3K . On the right side of the demarcation line, however, there exists a cutoff value of \u03c3K , above (below) which welfare falls (rises) following the airline\u2013HSR cooperation. This cutoff value, \u03c3 \u0303 K , is between 0.87 and 1 and is a function of \u03b3, i.e., \u03c3 \u0303 K = F \u03b3 ( \u03b3 ) with \u03b3 \u220a[0.7,1]. 14 F\u03b3 (\u03b3) can be shown to be monotonically decreasing in \u03b3, for \u03b3 \u220a[0.7,1]. 14 Thus, when the substitutability between air and HSR services is high (\u03b3 >0.7) and there is no or little capacity constraint at the hub airport, the airline\u2013HSR cooperation will reduce welfare. Proposition 3 has clear policy implications. First, it shows that the modal substitutability in the market where the airline and the HSR would compete (absent an airline\u2013HSR cooperation) plays a key role in assessing the welfare impact of such cooperation. As long as the modal substitutability is low, the cooperation would improve welfare, independent of whether or not the hub capacity is constrained. The social benefit comes from the fact that the flight\u2013HSR connecting service \u2013 made possible by the cooperation \u2013 raises total demand in the connecting market, while the negative effect of dampening competition in the HSR-accessible market is relatively small (owing to the low substitutability). Second, when the modal substitutability is high and hence the negative effect from dampening competition becomes larger, it would benefit policy makers to pay attention to hub capacity. If the hub is significantly capacity-constrained, then the airline\u2013HSR cooperation could help alleviate the constrained capacity and benefit passengers in other transport markets of the network, leading to a net welfare improvement. 15 In particular, the cooperation enables the partners to redistribute traffic from the capacity-constrained air sector to the (unconstrained) rail sector, accommodating more passengers and thus improving economic efficiency. This \u201ctraffic reallocation\u201d effect is increasing in the hub airport capacity shortage, so is decreasing in \u03c3K (and totally disappears when \u03c3 K \u2a7e 1 ). The larger the \u03b3 is, the larger the difference between the anticompetitive effect and the \u201cdemand stimulation\u201d effect would be, and a greater hub capacity shortage is needed to make the net welfare effect positive. That is why in Fig. 2 \u03c3 \u0303 K is decreasing in \u03b3. 15 Otherwise, the cooperation should be carefully examined, owing to its likely welfare-reducing effect. Furthermore, it would be interesting to see the impact of an airline\u2013HSR cooperation on firms and passengers separately. This is because welfare is, as defined here, an equally weighted sum of producer surplus and consumer surplus. Under some circumstances however, policy makers may put different weights on these two types of surplus, and the policy implication of airline\u2013HSR cooperation may be very different as a result. 16 Some papers such as Yang and Zhang (2012) have examined the importance of these \u201cweights\u201d in their analysis of airline-HSR interactions. 16 Since the airline\u2013HSR cooperation considered here will not reduce the joint profit but may under some conditions reduce welfare, the positive consumer-surplus effect of the cooperation is much less likely than the positive welfare effect. In particular, we find that the positive consumer-surplus effect arises only when the modal substitutability is very low and the hub airport is not capacity-constrained. 17 See the 5th columns of Tables A1 and A2 for detailed comparison results. 17 The passengers\u2019 gain comes mainly from the increased traffic in the connecting market due to the flight\u2013HSR connecting service. When the hub capacity is ample and the modal substitutability is low, this gain is significant and it dominates the negative market-power effect naturally associated with the cooperation (which is small when the substitutability is low). This finding is crucial in policy making where consumer surplus is considered more important than producer surplus; it suggests that a stricter attitude may be adopted in the evaluation of such cooperation. 4 Extended analysis on welfare effects 4.1 Baseline for simulation study In this section we relax our assumptions on cost and demand, in order to see the sensitivity of the welfare implications of the airline\u2013HSR cooperation. For this purpose, we first construct a baseline case with values of \u03b1 and \u03b3 estimated from relevant empirical studies, and then examine the impact of various factors one at a time. The baseline case is derived from Behrens and Pels (2012), who conduct an interesting analysis of the airlines\u2013HSR competition in the London\u2013Paris passenger market. They report both the direct and cross elasticities of demand for the two transport modes, from which we could obtain a reasonable estimate of substitutability parameter . This is then followed by an estimation of market-size parameter \u03b1, leading to our baseline of \u03b1 =600 and \u03b3 =0.71. 18 For the detailed procedure of parameter estimation, see Appendix B. 18 Note that this \u03b3 value is fairly large, which, while fitting the London\u2013Paris market well, may not be true for other markets. 19 Behrens and Pels (2012) suggest that there was fierce competition between the airlines and the HSR in the London-Paris passenger market. The distance between the two cities is 457km, which also falls into the \u201cfierce competition\u201d distance range defined by Janic (1993) and Rothengatter (2011). 19 For example, Fu et al. (2014) find that there exists substantial product differentiation between air travel and HSR service in Japan, suggesting a smaller value for \u03b3. An examination of the relevant literature (e.g., Ivaldi and Vibes, 2008; Meunier and Quinet, 2012) suggests that while \u03b3 may cover a wide range of values due to the diversity of market characteristics, it is more likely to be relatively large. 20 Ivaldi and Vibes (2008) study the Cologne\u2013Berlin market (600km long) and report both the own and cross price elasticities of demand for the rail and the air sectors. Their study would imply a relatively high modal substitutability in that market. Meunier and Quinet (2012) demonstrate the own and cross price elasticities of demand for the two modes based on simulations of a few European markets, which would also imply a relatively high modal substitutability. 20 As shown in Fig. 2 of Section 3, there exists a threshold of substitutability parameter \u03b3 (0.7) that breaks the welfare comparison into two parts. 21 Note that the baseline value of \u03b3 is higher than the threshold, meaning that the welfare implication of the airline\u2013HSR cooperation is not universal (depending on \u03c3K as well). 21 On one side of the threshold, the airline\u2013HSR cooperation improves welfare irrespective of relative hub capacity level \u03c3K . On the other side, there exists a cutoff value of \u03c3K , denoted \u03c3 \u0303 K , such that welfare rises only when \u03c3 K < \u03c3 \u0303 K . As shown below, similar patterns emerge for the variables investigated in this section, and these patterns will be illustrated using figures that are similar to Fig. 2. 4.2 Cost asymmetry (factor c) Consider first that cR =0 and cA = c where the constant c can be non-zero. While the \u201ccommon\u201d view would be c >0, it appears that the literature has yet to reach a consensus. Studies such as Froidh (2008) and Meunier and Quinet (2012) estimate that airlines have a higher unit operating cost than HSR operators. On the other hand, Levinson et al. (1997) report that HSR incurs a higher unit operating cost than airlines. Union Internationales des Chemins de Fer (UIC, 2008) suggests that low rail access charges need to be assumed for HSR to obtain a lower unit operating cost than airlines. For completeness, we do not impose restrictions on the sign of c. Nonetheless, if c is too large or too small, cases do exist in which one mode squeezes the other out of the market due to cost advantage. These cases are less relevant to our study and so are deliberately assumed away. As a consequence, the non-negativity condition in the feasibility analysis is more stringent than the other two groups of feasibility conditions. 22 We adopt the same treatment in the subsequent cases of this section. If similar patterns are found, we shall just present the feasible ranges without much discussion. 22 In particular, feasibility requires c \u220a(\u2212246,135). Similar to Section 3, the welfare implication of the airline\u2013HSR cooperation for the values of c and \u03c3K is illustrated in Fig. 3 . There is a vertical demarcation line (c =6.55in this case) that divides the welfare implication into two parts. When c >6.55, welfare always rises after the cooperation, irrespective of the relative hub capacity level. When c <6.55 however, there exists a cutoff value of \u03c3K , over which welfare is reduced by the cooperation. This value is an increasing function of c, denoted \u03c3 \u0303 K = F c ( c ) . That is, the larger (smaller) the HSR cost advantage (disadvantage), the more likely the cooperation is welfare improving. This finding is intuitive, because the demand-stimulation effect (a main positive impact of the airline\u2013HSR cooperation) will be strengthened if HSR is more cost efficient than the airline. In particular, the smaller the HSR cost, the more the flight\u2013HSR connecting traffic will be generated post-cooperation, and the greater the benefit of such cooperation. Therefore, the hub capacity shortage required to justify the cooperation decreases in c, and when c reaches a certain value, the airline\u2013HSR cooperation becomes welfare enhancing unambiguously. 4.3 Economies of traffic density (factors \u03b8A and \u03b8R ) A prominent feature in the air and the rail sectors is the economies of traffic density: the unit cost on a link declines with total traffic on the link. The existence of the density effect in the airline industry has been demonstrated by a number of empirical studies (e.g., Caves et al., 1984; Brueckner et al., 1992; Brueckner and Spiller, 1994); strong economies of traffic density have also been identified in the rail industry (Braeutigam and Turnquist, 1984; McGeehan, 1993; Graham et al., 2003). To capture this feature we follow such papers as Brueckner and Spiller (1991), Zhang (1996), Brueckner (2001) and Bilotkach (2007) by using the following cost function for each link: (18) C s ( Q ) = Q - \u03b8 s Q 2 where Q is the total traffic of a specific mode on the link and \u03b8s is a positive density effect parameter, with s=A, R representing the air and the rail modes, respectively. 23 Since link-specific total cost can be separated into variable costs and fixed costs, the economies can come from two sources: falling marginal costs and spreading fixed costs over more traffic. Specification (18) captures the case of falling marginal costs. Note that \u03b8s =0 represents the absence of density economies. 23 Given the baseline combination of \u03b1 and \u03b3, the feasible ranges for \u03b8A and \u03b8R are [0,0.0015) and [0,0.0028), respectively. We find that the thresholds over which the airline\u2013HSR cooperation unambiguously improves welfare are not within the feasible combinations of \u03b8A and \u03b8R . This suggests that economies of traffic density alone cannot justify the intermodal cooperation. However, if the hub airport faces a certain level of capacity constraint, the cooperation can still be welfare enhancing. In other words, we can still find \u03c3 \u0303 K . Fig. 4 is an illustration of how \u03c3 \u0303 K shifts with different combinations of \u03b8A and \u03b8R . In Fig. 4, the contour lines represent different values of \u03c3 \u0303 K . We observe that given a specific \u03b8A , the larger the \u03b8R is, the larger the \u03c3 \u0303 K will be. By contrast, given a specific \u03b8R , the larger the is, the smaller the \u03c3 \u0303 K will be. This means that the economies of traffic density in the two transport modes play different roles in the evaluation of the airline\u2013HSR cooperation. In particular, when the density effect in the air sector is strong, the intermodal cooperation is less likely to be socially beneficial under hub capacity constraints; but when the density effect in the rail sector is strong, this cooperation is more likely to improve welfare. The mechanism is similar to what we discussed in Section 4.2. Thus, the higher the cost advantage of the rail sector relative to the air sector (in terms of either the unit cost or the density effect), the more likely the cooperation is welfare enhancing. 4.4 Vertical differentiation (factor \u03b4 ) We have so far assumed that the two transportation modes are purely horizontally differentiated. As shown by Behrens and Pels (2012), vertical differentiation appears important between rail and air (in addition to the horizontal-differentiation aspect). This subsection considers a situation where the air\u2013HSR differentiation is not only horizontal but also vertical. Recall that assuming vertical differentiation is equivalent to assigning various values to \u03b1 i j in equation (1). Here we consider that vertical differentiation exists only across the two modes but not across markets: \u03b1 1 A = \u03b1 2 A = \u03b1 3 AA = \u03b1 = 600 whilst \u03b1 3 AR = \u03b1 2 R = \u03b4 \u03b1 = 600 \u03b4 , with \u03b4 >0capturing vertical differentiation between the two modes. Which transport mode possesses a higher quality, i.e., whether or not, is generally case-dependent. As suggested by the empirical literature (e.g., Gonzalez-Savignat, 2004; Ivaldi and Vibes, 2008; Behrens and Pels, 2012; Fu et al., 2014), such factors as travel time and frequency play an important role in affecting passengers\u2019 perception about quality and hence their modal choice. And these factors may vary across different markets for both modes. Therefore, to make our analysis robust we allow to be greater or smaller than 1. In effect, the feasible range of \u03b4 is (0.71, 1.41). We find that when \u03b4 is sufficiently large (>1.01) the airline\u2013HSR cooperation always improves welfare. And when \u03b4 is relatively small, a cutoff value of \u03c3K can be found, above which the cooperation reduces welfare. This value \u03c3 \u0303 K depends on \u03b4, denoted \u03c3 \u0303 K = F \u03b4 ( \u03b4 ) , and the corresponding welfare implication is illustrated in Fig. 5 . As can be seen from the figure, \u03c3 \u0303 K first decreases, and then increases, as \u03b4 rises. The analysis shows that the cooperation is more likely to be welfare improving when HSR is superior or much inferior to the airline with respect to quality. This is because two effects of the cooperation are related to the vertical differentiation between modes. First, the demand-stimulation effect increases monotonically with the relative attractiveness of the HSR, since the higher the quality of the HSR service is relative to the airline service, the more passengers will be attracted to the flight\u2013HSR connecting service. Second, a new type of reallocation effect (other than the one concerning hub capacity discussed in Section 3) arises following the cooperation, since the cooperation allows more passengers to be redistributed from a low-quality product to a high-quality product. This effect increases with the quality differentiation between the two modes. When \u03b4 >1, these two effects both increase in \u03b4, and they dominate the negative anticompetitive effect of the cooperation when \u03b4 >1.01. When \u03b4 <1, the demand-stimulation effect still increases but the reallocation effect decreases in \u03b4. The net (positive) effect first decreases and then increases in \u03b4, but is in general dominated by the negative anticompetitive effect. 4.5 Differential price sensitivities of demand (factor \u03b2) Next we examine the impact of differential values of \u03b2 i j which, for given \u03b1 i j and \u03b3, measure the price sensitivities of demand. 24 Assume that there are two products, m and n, in market i, the inverse demand function for product m is then given by p i m = \u03b1 i m - \u03b2 i m q i m - \u03b3 q i n . The corresponding demand function is q i m = [ \u03b2 i n ( \u03b1 i m - p i m ) - \u03b3 ( \u03b1 i n - p i n ) ] / ( \u03b2 i m \u03b2 i n - \u03b3 2 ) . The own price sensitivity of demand is thus \u03b2 i n / ( \u03b2 i m \u03b2 i n - \u03b3 2 ) . Given a specific \u03b2 i n and a specific \u03b3, the larger the \u03b2 i m , the smaller this sensitivity. 24 It is possible that \u03b2 i j is different across the transport modes due to the heterogeneity of service characteristics. Empirical findings also support this possibility. For example, Ivaldi and Vibes (2008), Meunier and Quinet (2012) and Behrens and Pels (2012) find very different own price elasticities for airlines and HSR. Consider that \u03b2 1 A = \u03b2 2 A = \u03b2 3 AA = 1 , while \u03b2 3 AR = \u03b2 2 R = \u03b2 , with \u03b2 >0. 25 Ivaldi and Vibes (2008), Meunier and Quinet (2012) and Behrens and Pels (2012) all find that the own elasticity of demand is lower for HSR than for airlines, suggesting \u03b2 >1. To keep the analysis complete however, we also consider the case of \u03b2 <1. 25 The feasibility analysis suggests that \u03b2 >0.71, which is reasonable given that \u03b3 =0.71. We find that within the feasible \u03b2 range, the airline\u2013HSR cooperation unambiguously increases welfare when \u03b2 is smaller than a particular value (0.97). For \u03b2 >0.97, the welfare implication of the cooperation can be ambiguous however, depending on both \u03b2 and \u03c3K . Similar to Sections 4.2 and 4.4, the welfare implication for the case of differential price sensitivities of demand is summarized in Fig. 6 . From Fig. 6 we can see that \u03c3 \u0303 K first decreases and then increases in \u03b2. Note that the larger the \u03b2, the smaller the price sensitivity of demand for HSR relative to the airline. This implies that it is more likely for the cooperation to be welfare enhancing when HSR demand is either very price sensitive or very price insensitive. The price sensitivity of demand would have an impact on both the demand-stimulation effect and the anticompetitive effect. On one hand, the higher the price sensitivity of HSR demand, the lower the flight\u2013HSR connecting service will be priced, and the more passengers will be served. In other words, the positive demand-stimulation effect monotonically decreases in \u03b2. On the other hand, when the price sensitivity of HSR demand is very high or very low, the anticompetitive effect of the cooperation is weak since the two modes do not compete fiercely in the first place. That is, the negative anticompetitive effect first increases and then decreases in \u03b2. When \u03b2 is small, the (strong) demand-stimulation effect dominates the (weak) anticompetitive effect, thereby improving welfare unambiguously. As \u03b2 increases, the anticompetitive effect first increases and dominates the ever decreasing demand-stimulation effect; and then the anticompetitive effect decreases, closing the gap between these two effects but never reversing the relationship again. 4.6 Heterogeneous passengers (factor \u03c6) Studies such as Gonzalez-Savignat (2004), Ivaldi and Vibes (2008), Czerny and Zhang (2011) and Behrens and Pels (2012) have stressed the distinction between different passenger groups, particularly between business and leisure passengers. It is suggested that these two groups exhibit large differences in both the willingness-to-pay and the degree of substitutability between transport modes (Ivaldi and Vibes, 2008). Therefore, where the aggregate demand is concerned, the percentage of these passenger groups may have an impact on both market size indicator \u03b1 and modal substitutability parameter \u03b3. In particular, the higher the percentage of business passengers in a market is, the larger the \u03b1 and the smaller the \u03b3. 26 Ivaldi and Vibes (2008) explicitly state that the degree of substitutability between rail and air transport is higher in the leisure market than in the business market. 26 Here we use parameter \u03c6 to denote the percentage of business passengers. Assuming that the interaction between this percentage and \u03b1 as well as \u03b3 are both linear, we estimate, based on the information derived from Behrens and Pels (2012), that \u03b1 =494+298\u03c6 and \u03b3 =0.825\u22120.235\u03c6. 27 Please refer to Appendix B for the detailed estimation procedure. Note that we adopt a very restricted functional form to describe the relationship between \u03c6 and \u03b1 as well as \u03b3, so as to give a rough idea about the role \u03c6 plays in the welfare implication of the airline-HSR cooperation. 27 Further, it can be shown that the feasible range for \u03c6 is between 0 and 1. It is straightforward to see that, when \u03c6 is larger than a specific value (0.535 in this case) the intermodal cooperation will improve welfare, irrespective of the hub capacity level. For \u03c6 <0.535however, only when the hub airport is capacity-constrained can the cooperation be welfare improving. The situation is depicted in Fig. 7 . The figure shows that \u03c3 \u0303 K increases with \u03c6 (when \u03c6 <0.535). Furthermore, the analysis reveals that the higher the percentage of business passengers in a market, the more likely the cooperation is welfare enhancing. This is because the higher the percentage of business passengers, the larger the market size and the smaller the modal substitutability. In other words, the (positive) demand-stimulation effect is larger while the (negative) anticompetitive effect is smaller, both pointing in the welfare-enhancing direction. 4.7 A reference case In this subsection, we attempt to offer a complete picture of the welfare implications of airline\u2013HSR cooperation. This is done with a reasonable case in which we incorporate all the factors that have been considered in the paper. More specifically, the utility function used to obtain the demand functions is given by: (19) U = \u03b1 ( q 1 A + q 2 A + q 3 AA ) + \u03b1 \u03b4 ( q 2 R + q 3 AR ) - 1 2 [ ( q 1 A 2 + q 2 A 2 + q 3 AA 2 ) + \u03b2 ( q 2 R 2 + q 3 AR 2 ) + 2 \u03b3 ( q 2 A q 2 R + q 3 AA q 3 AR ) ] whereas the cost functions for the two modes are: (20) C A ( Q ) = c A ( 1 - \u03b8 A Q ) Q C R ( Q ) = c R ( 1 - \u03b8 R Q ) Q Next, we need to derive a set of parameter estimates from relevant empirical studies. We first estimate \u03b1 and \u03b3 as well as \u03b4 and \u03b2 from Behrens and Pels (2012), and then obtain cA and \u03b8A from Brueckner and Spiller (1994). 28 Note that the data used in Brueckner and Spiller (1994) are from the fourth quarter of 1985, which is much earlier than the data sources of other empirical papers used for the estimation. It is reasonable to conjecture that cA would be lower while \u03b8A would be higher if more recent data were available, due to the fact that technology developments tend to improve cost efficiency. 28 The estimation of cR and \u03b8R , on the other hand, is based on information from Campos and de Rus (2009). 29 The information in Levinson et al. (1997) also gives very similar estimates. 29 The estimates are listed in Table 3 : With this combination of parameters we find that when the hub airport does not face capacity constraint, welfare falls following the airline\u2013HSR cooperation (226,687 vs. 236,672). Only when the hub capacity level is under a certain value (700), would the cooperation improve welfare. This reference case shows again the importance of hub capacity in assessing the welfare impact of airline\u2013HSR cooperation. 5 Concluding remarks This paper has developed a simple, tractable model to study the impact of cooperation between a hub-and-spoke airline and a high-speed rail (HSR) operator when the hub airport is under a possible capacity constraint. We found that the airline\u2013HSR cooperation reduces traffic in the HSR-accessible market where prior competition between the partners occurs. But outside of this direct market, the cooperation increases traffic in the hub-and-spoke connecting market, and has an ambiguous effect on traffic in the HSR-inaccessible market. The airline\u2013HSR cooperation improves welfare whenever the substitutability between air flights and HSR service is low \u2013 in this situation the anticompetitive effect of the intermodal cooperation is not strong and is likely to be dominated by its demand-stimulation effect in the connecting market. When the substitutability is high, then hub capacity plays an important role in assessing the welfare impact of airline\u2013HSR cooperation. Such cooperation improves (reduces) welfare if the hub airport is (is not) seriously capacity-constrained. We have further examined the impact of other factors on welfare through simulation. We found that the airline\u2013HSR cooperation is welfare enhancing irrespective of the hub capacity level if any one of the following conditions holds: (1) the unit cost of the HSR operator is sufficiently lower than that of the airline; (2) the HSR service is sufficiently superior to the airline service; (3) the price sensitivity of HSR demand is higher than that of airline demand; and (4) a sufficiently large proportion of the passengers are business passengers. Our analysis shows that economies of traffic density alone cannot justify the airline\u2013HSR cooperation. Furthermore, when the density effect in the air sector is strong, the cooperation is less likely to be welfare enhancing under hub capacity constraints. On the other hand, when the density effect in the rail sector is strong, this cooperation is more likely to be welfare enhancing. As airline\u2013HSR cooperative activities have become more popular (but have yet to draw serious attention from researchers and regulators), these findings are suggestive to policy makers. A careful examination of airport capacity, network interactions and other salient features in both modes is warranted. In particular, some less-mentioned benefits of the cooperation, such as the market-expansion effect due to the creation of new intermodal service and the allocation-efficiency effect due to modal asymmetry in quality, should draw policy makers\u2019 attention. The paper has also raised a number of issues and avenues for further research. First, we modeled airline\u2013HSR rivalry as quantity competition, with the intention of examining a short-run model. In general, which model of competition is applicable to a particular market depends in large part on the production technology (in addition to the time horizon). In quantity competition firms commit to quantities, and prices then adjust to clear the market, implying the industry is flexible in price adjustments, even in the short run. On the other hand, in price (Bertrand) competition, capacity is unlimited or easily adjusted in the short run. Although there are some good reasons to believe that quantity competition may be more relevant for the present paper, it would be interesting to see how the results might change with price competition, and to further study the empirical relevance of alternative oligopoly models to the transport markets under consideration. Second, we considered the case of a single airline and a single HSR operator. In reality the markets are likely to have more firms, especially in the airline sector. When multiple firms in each sector converge in a network of transportation markets, the possibilities of strategic interactions will be enlarged and complicated. Extending the analysis to a framework with more competitors would be a useful future study. Third, several empirical studies suggest that factors such as travel time and frequency can be important in airline\u2013HSR interactions (Gonzalez-Savignat, 2004; Ivaldi and Vibes, 2008; Behrens and Pels, 2012; Fu et al., 2014). While the present paper has implicitly modeled (and, to a certain extent, studied) their impacts as the modal differentiation, horizontally and/or vertically, it would be a natural extension to explicitly incorporate these factors into a more complete analytical framework. Finally, we have abstracted away the environmental effects from our analysis. Whether HSR service is superior to air flights with respect to emissions remains controversial empirically (e.g., Chester and Horvath, 2010). 30 Although it is generally accepted that HSR incurs less per passenger-km emission than airlines, it also leads to additional environmental costs in terms of land occupied, barrier effects, visual intrusion and noise (de Rus, 2011). The environmental effect of the HSR technology is particularly acute in the construction phase. Kageson (2009) concludes \u201cinvestment in high speed rail is under most circumstances likely to reduce greenhouse gases from traffic compared to a situation when the line was not built. The reduction, though, is small and it may take decades for it to compensate for the emissions caused by construction.\u201d This aspect is less relevant to our analysis since we study an existing HSR line, but it is still a notable point to consider in a more comprehensive investigation. 30 Even if environmental benefits do exist for HSR, some studies suggest that they are insignificant when deciding on the social desirability of HSR (de Rus, 2011). Furthermore, different countries may value environmental benefits differently, depending on their economic development stages and the focus of the government at the time. 31 In the present study we thus follow the advice of Sichelschmidt (1999) by focusing only on the \u201ceconomic\u201d issue. Nevertheless, as noted by an anonymous referee, there is little doubt that diverting air traffic to existing HSR lines is beneficial to the environment, and the environmental concern is a strong motive in individual circumstances for airline-HSR cooperation. See also Adler et al. (2010). 31 However, the environmental impact needs to be taken into account for a more complete policy assessment on airline\u2013HSR cooperation. A general conjecture may be that if HSR exhibits substantial advantage over air transport with respect to the environment, the intermodal cooperation tends to be more socially favorable.

Appendix A We summarize, in Tables A1 and A2 , the market structures before and after the airline\u2013HSR cooperation, as well as the impact of the cooperation on traffic volumes, welfare and consumer surplus levels under different combinations of \u03b3 and k. Note that the cutoff value when comparing (8\u22124\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3 2)/[4(4\u2212 \u03b3 2)] and \u03b3 is not exactly 2 - 1 , but it is very close. We neglect this small range for the sake of presentation clarity, but incorporating it will not alter our propositions. Appendix B B.1 Estimation of the utility function Behrens and Pels (2012) use revealed preference data and estimate two logit models (the nested multinomial logit and the mixed multinomial logit) to examine the demand patterns of two types of passengers (leisure and business). They thus obtain four groups of estimation results. In addition, they look at six airport-airline pairs that give different estimates (Heathrow/Air France, Heathrow/British Airways, Heathrow/British Midland Airways, Gatwick/British Airways, Luton/easyJet, and City/Air France). We exclude the Luton/easyJet pair because easyJet, a low-cost carrier, does not adopt the hub-and-spoke network considered in our model. The City/Air France pair is excluded due to low traffic volume. The cross elasticities of air demand with respect to the HSR fare are defined as \u025bAR =(\u2202 QA /\u2202 PR )(PR /QA ), where A represents an airport/airline pair and R represents the HSR. They are equal to PR /(\u03b3QA ) in our model after adjustment with the own elasticities. The elasticities, the average fares and the traffic volumes are all reported in Behrens and Pels (2012), so \u03b3can be easily estimated. We are able to obtain one \u03b3for every airport/airline combination in every choice model. Subsequently we use the traffic volumes as a weight to obtain a weighted-average value for every model. The four weighted average \u03b3\u2019s are 0.60 (nested-business), 0.81 (nested-leisure), 0.58 (mixed-business) and 0.84 (mixed-leisure). Taking weighted average again gives 0.71 as our final estimate. Given the estimation of \u03b3 and the other information provided by Behrens and Pels (2012) \u2013 i.e., average fares and traffic volumes of different modes \u2013 we can easily obtain \u03b1 by fitting the linear demand functions of our model. With the average traffic volume per hour, we obtain that \u03b1 is around 600. Taking into account the heterogeneity of passengers, we separate the estimates for business and leisure passengers. In particular, we establish that \u03b3 =0.59 for leisure passengers and \u03b3 =0.825 for business passengers. If a linear relationship is imposed between the business passenger percentage (\u03c6) and weighted average \u03b3, we have \u03b3 =0.825\u2212(0.825\u22120.59)\u03c6 =0.825\u22120.235\u03c6. A similar approach is adopted to obtain the relationship between \u03c6 and the weighted average \u03b1. The procedure to estimate \u03b2 is very similar to the one used to obtain \u03b3, but with own elasticities instead of cross elasticities. The estimation of \u03b4 is straightforward when the other parameters are given. B.2 Estimation of the cost functions Brueckner and Spiller (1994) estimate linear marginal cost for airlines, which can be directly used for our purpose. Campos and de Rus (2009) detail the operating statistics and the operating costs for 11 types of high-speed train in four European countries (namely, TGV Reseau, TGV DUPLEX and THALYS in France; ICE-1, ICE-2, ICE-3, ICE 3 Polyc. and ICE/T in Germany; ETR 500 and ETR 480 in Italy; and AVE in Spain). We assume that these high-speed train technologies have an identical cost structure and we estimate this cost structure based on the variability in seat capacities of these train models.
