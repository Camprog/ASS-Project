"Transportation Research Part B: MethodologicalEstimating the demand responses for different sizes of air passenger groupsAbstract This paper investigates the sensitivity of demand for air travel by singleton passengers, couples, and families. It examines how the demand for air travel by these groups is potentially different. In this study, a compound Poisson structure of the demand of different passenger groups is considered, and aggregate demand observations and maximum likelihood procedures are used to decompound the processes and estimate demand sensitivity of each group of customers to price, time, season, and the economic cycle. The methodology is applied to Canadian market data and the results indicate there are significant differences among the different groups of customers.serial JL 271728 291210 291772 291817 31 Transportation Research Part B: Methodological TRANSPORTATIONRESEARCHPARTBMETHODOLOGICAL 2013-02-13 2013-02-13 2013-02-27T13:47:23 1-s2.0-S0191261513000040 S0191-2615(13)00004-0 S0191261513000040 10.1016/j.trb.2012.11.004 S300 S300.1 FULL-TEXT 1-s2.0-S0191261513X00025 2015-05-14T05:39:52.915433-04:00 0 0 20130301 20130331 2013 2013-02-13T00:00:00Z articleinfo crossmark dco dateupdated tomb dateloaded datesearch indexeddate volumelist yearnav articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright dateloadedtxt docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdateend pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype subheadings suppl volfirst volissue webpdf webpdfpagecount figure table body mmlmath acknowledge affil appendices articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authkeywords authlast footnotes primabst ref specialabst alllist content subj ssids 0191-2615 01912615 true 49 49 C Volume 49 3 24 38 24 38 201303 March 2013 2013-03-01 2013-03-31 2013 article fla Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract This paper investigates the sensitivity of demand for air travel by singleton passengers, couples, and families. It examines how the demand for air travel by these groups is potentially different. In this study, a compound Poisson structure of the demand of different passenger groups is considered, and aggregate demand observations and maximum likelihood procedures are used to decompound the processes and estimate demand sensitivity of each group of customers to price, time, season, and the economic cycle. The methodology is applied to Canadian market data and the results indicate there are significant differences among the different groups of customers. Keywords Decompounding Compound Poisson Demand Groups Passenger Airline 1 Introduction The airline industry has turned price differentiation into a highly refined skill as it sets prices for different market segments and varies these prices against select criteria on a continuous basis (Su, 2007; Mantin and Koo, 2009). This practice, called yield management, is now also applied in pricing hotels, rental cars, concert tickets, and in other markets where there are a number of market segments with differing demand elasticities. There is also intertemporal price discrimination. For example, as the departure date approaches, airfares generally rise but not at the same rate across all fare classes. Such yield management requires highly detailed data as well as sophisticated forecasting systems and measures of customer responsiveness to changes in prices. The price sensitivity of passengers with differing trip purposes (i.e. business, leisure, visiting-friends and relatives) has been examined in both the economics and yield management literature. One can find hundreds of papers related to price sensitivity of different classes of customers and different routes. Summaries of these papers are published in (Oum et al., 1992; Gillen and Morrison, 2007). Although there is anecdotal evidence that price sensitivity differs as the size of the travel group increases, there has not been a systematic rigorous investigation of whether and by how much price elasticities may differ among singletons, couples and larger groups of travellers. 2 Some demand models have included a variable for the size of the group in the estimation equation. For example, Alperovich and Machnes (1994) reported they have included family size in the regression models but they did not discuss it since their coefficient was insignificant. 2 Additionally, there is the challenge of how such differences in price sensitivity would be revealed. In the case of, for example, business versus leisure travel, airlines can identify which passenger fits into which group; last minute bookings, short trips, time of flight, choice of destination are all possible means of discriminating. Booking data, unless one has access to actual records with the firm (i.e. airline, hotel, car rental, etc.), does not provide information on group size. Perhaps if the time of purchase and seat choice could be observed, one could make a judgment that three seats purchased at one time for the same flight is a group of three traveling together, but it may not necessarily be true. There is also nothing to reveal whether the group of three is more or less price sensitive than a couple for example. 3 Airlines do offer special pricing to larger groups but these are generally groups of nine or more. 3 An airline will observe the booking curve for a given flight and adjust fares depending on the degree to which the booking curve is deviating from the forecasted booking behaviour. The research questions we ask in this paper are: are differences in the price sensitivity contingent on the size of the group traveling together, and second, how can demand functions for different sizes of purchasing (in our case passenger) groups be estimated when only aggregated data are available. The answer, we argue can be found in the properties of integer numbers. A key requirement for a successful revenue management system is accurate demand information including measures of the sensitivity of demand to changes in prices, service and other factors affecting demand. For example, when purchasing tickets, singletons behave differently from couples, or other groups of customers due to the simple fact that there are fewer constraints. Knowing how different groups of customers are affected by different demand variables can equip airlines with the information to effectively price differentiate among different groups of customers. As an example, they can provide special pricing packages in special seasons to families with 1 or 2 children in order to motivate them to travel more or to travel to select destinations. Davis (1994) showed American airlines generated over $1.4 billion over the course of three years due to successfully applying revenue management techniques. This resulted in a sizable $891 million in net profit. Such a tremendous increase in profit undoubtedly justifies the airlines decision to be among the first industries to apply sophisticated mathematical and operations research pricing tools. The results of this paper suggest that significant-in cases near 10 times-differences in price sensitivity among different groups of customers can potentially be translated into an opportunity for airlines to reap more profit by considering the size of the travel group in both price differentiation and yield management. 4 In general, spatial discrimination adopted by competing firms may put firms in a Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma (see Thisse and Vives, 1988). 4 As an example, based on the data used here, the airline could increase profit by giving discounts to larger groups in times of economic downturn while maintaining the price charged to singletons. Currently, pricing assumes all passengers are singletons, and an average elasticity is used in price setting which results in fare adjustments for all passengers regardless of group size. One of the properties that is used extensively in this paper is the property of integer number and count data. Section 2 provides an introduction to count data models and describes their role and importance in developing the models used in the estimations. Section 3 describes the specifications of the data, the empirical research question that this data is used to address, and why compound Poisson processes and decompounding techniques are the most appropriate models among all possible candidates. An important contribution of this paper is the econometric method used in the estimation. Section 4 describes the development of the method and why it is appropriate for both the research question asked and the type of data available. Section 5 reports the empirical results, provides methods to use the results of the models to compute the elasticities and marginal effects, and illustrates how the results can be used in developing pricing and other revenue strategies. A summary is provided in Section 6. 2 Count data 2.1 Poisson distributions Data counted in the form of integer numbers are referred to as count data. Usually count data are non-negative numbers; for instance, the number of days individuals are absent from work are considered as count data. Upon reflection, a significant proportion of data used in the operations management and transportation literature are count data; number of people in a queue, number of available seats on a particular flight, the inventory level, etc. are all count data. In general, anything that can be counted as discrete entities can be regarded as count data. The Poisson distribution is commonly used to represent the distributions of count data. This distribution has the feature that if the expected number of occurrences in a predefined interval is \u03bb >0, then based on the Poisson distribution the probability of exactly k occurrences is computed by: (1) f ( Y = k ; \u03bb ) = \u03bb k e - \u03bb k ! An interesting, but restrictive characteristic of Poisson distributions is that their mean and variance are both \u03bb. This property allows us to fully identify the whole distribution by knowing the expected number of occurrences. 5 However, such a property restricts us from using Poisson distributions for data that exhibits a significant difference between the mean and variance. 5 Another attribute of Poisson distributions is regularity when time intervals are changed. If an interval which is t times the original time interval is considered, the number of k occurrences resulting from such a time interval change can easily be computed as a Poisson process with parameter \u03bbt: (2) f ( Y = k ; \u03bb , t ) = ( \u03bb t ) k e - \u03bb t k ! It is possible to consider functional forms for parameters of Poisson processes. 6 A useful feature of Poisson processes is that the sum of Poisson processes is still Poisson; for example when two or more Poisson processes Y 1, Y 2, \u2026, Y n with respective parameters of \u03bb 1, \u03bb 2, \u2026, \u03bb n are added together, the resulting process is still Poisson with parameter \u039b = \u2211 i = 1 n \u03bb i . 6 Adding functional forms to the parameter(s) makes it possible to analyse how different factors change the count data outcomes. For example, by defining \u03bb = f(X 1, X 2, X 3), the way that changes in X 1, X 2, and X 3 affect the outcome, Y, could be analyzed. One of the main issues with considering functional forms for the parameter(s) is the \u03bb >0 restriction; this restriction ensures that the mapping from X 1, X 2, \u2026, X n lies in ]0,\u221e[ interval; \u03bb = e \u03b8 1 X 1 + \u03b8 2 X 2 + \u2026 + \u03b8 n X n + \u03b8 n + 1 is one of the most commonly used transformations which ensures the transformation result will lie in the ]0,\u221e[ interval; (see Hausman et al., 1984; Gourieroux et al., 1984). It is also possible to introduce an error term to the functional form, however, it is essential that the final result never lies out of ]0,\u221e[ interval. One of the common ways to add such an error term is to consider the functional form of \u03b7 = e \u03f5 , where \u03f5 has any arbitrary distribution, with mean zero and variance \u03c3 2. The Poisson distribution with a random parameter is called mixed Poisson distribution. 7 Sometimes mixed Poisson processes, the Poisson processes with a random parameter, are incorrectly termed compound Poisson processes. 7 There are several ways to estimate the parameters \u03b8 1, \u03b8 2, \u2026, \u03b8 n . Maximum Likelihood, Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (see Gourieroux et al., 1984), and Normal Distribution approximation are among the most common estimation techniques. If \u03bb is large enough (say more than 1000) the Poisson distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean and variance \u03bb. Square root of the Poisson distribution with parameter \u03bb >10 can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean \u03bb , and variance 1 4 . 2.2 More advanced models for count data In addition to Poisson distributions, there exists more advanced and flexible models that can be applied to count data; negative binomial regression models are the most well-known models for count data after Poisson models. Negative binomial regression models are usually used to solve overdispersion (mean \u226a variance) problems. There also exist methodologies to deal with common problems that may occur while dealing with certain types of count data such as excess number of zeros, and underdispersion. Zero inflated Poisson, zero inflated Negative Binomial, Gamma distributions (Oh et al., 2006; Winkelmann and Zimmermann, 1995; Lord et al., 2005) are the most common distributions used to solve the problem of excess zeros and underdispersion. One can refer to Lord and Mannering (2010) for a detailed list of most relevant models used for count data in transportation science and more specifically crash-data. Recently due to the advent of more powerful computers, more sophisticated models such as finite mixture and Markov switching models received attention Schnatter (2006). Since it may be easy to mix the notion of finite mixture models with compound Poisson models, we describe what finite mixture models do and then will compare them with compound Poisson literature through an example. Assume a population is made up of m subgroups which are randomly mixed in proportion to the size of each group \u03b7 1, \u03b7 2, \u2026, \u03b7 m . Also assume a random feature Y is heterogenous across and homogenous within each of the m subgroups. Y has a different probability distribution, p(y\u2223\u03b8), with \u03b8 differing for each s subgroups. If without knowing the group indicator, we randomly sample from our population the mixture density will become (3) p ( y ) = \u2211 i = 1 s \u03b7 i p ( y | \u03b8 i ) One transportation example for mixture models is as follows. Assume passengers are all singleton and are either high or low income passengers. Assume, as is reasonable, that the price elasticity of these two groups will differ. Assume that you cannot observe the type of customer directly, but that it is possible to observe all transactions, meaning that you can observe the price at which tickets are purchased in addition to some of the attributes of each passenger. Since each transaction is correlated with one of the groups, and with some probability, applying finite mixture models will help to disentangle the specific distributions of each of the groups. 2.3 Compound Poissons and challenges One of the most straightforward way to introduce compound Poisson processes is by using a transportation example. Assume that all passengers travel in compact cars that can carry up to two passengers. Let\u2019s assume on average every minute one single driver enters a highway and car arrivals form a Poisson distribution. Also assume cars with two passengers arrive at rate three cars per minute and their arrivals also form a Poisson distribution. In this example the aggregate number of passengers is composed of the summation of the total number of cars that traveled with single passengers, and twice as much as the number of cars that traveled with two passengers follow a compound Poisson process. The process of retrieving the parameters of Poisson distribution-here the average arrival-of cars with single passengers and double passengers by looking at the historical aggregate observation, is known as decompounding. More formally, compound Poisson processes can be regarded as a convolution of Poisson processes if m i s is known, finite, and mutually exclusive real numbers and N i s is independent Poisson distributions. (4) N { t } = \u2211 i = 1 n m i N i { t } N { t } is a convolution of Poisson processes. In the example used earlier m 1 =1 for single passenger, m 2 =2 for double passengers, N 1 is the Poisson process of single passenger cars, and N 2 represents the Poisson process that forms double passenger arrivals. Consequently, N { t } represents the total number of passengers that passed along the highway by time t. Transportation is not the only field for which compound Poisson processes have applications. Compound Poisson models are frequently used in number of fields including; insurance mathematics (Lin and Pavlova, 2006), inventory models (Srinivasan and Lee, 1991; Song et al., 2010; Nenes et al., 2010), queueing theory (Carrillo, 1991), and modeling the scattering of charged particles (Ning et al., 1995). One of the best methods available for decompounding was developed by Buchmann and Gr\u00fcbel (2004). This methodology is based on the well-known Panjer Recursion algorithm (Panjer, 1981). Such methods are easy to use and efficient to estimate the parameters of compound Poisson processes when the parameters do not have any functional form. This method, and similar methods, cannot be used to estimate Poisson parameters of each process, \u03bb i s, when \u03bb i \u2019s themselves are functions of other parameters. In order to show how \u03bb i s can be dependent on other variables, we continue the example we used earlier. This time assume the single passengers are traveling more often in early mornings because they usually go to work in the morning, and couples start to travel on the highway more often later in the day. Clearly in this example the arrival rates highly depend on time, and as a result are functions of time of a date. In this example, decompounding is finding the parameters of functional forms on the variables that affect Poisson rates of each of the types of passengers. In order to show the distinction between compound Poisson processes and mixture models, consider the use of analogy used to depict mixture density. If you sample from a convolution of Poisson distributions introduced in (4), the compound density will become (5) p ( y ) = \u2211 { x 1 , x 2 , \u2026 , x s } \u2208 R s \u03b7 i p ( x i | \u03b8 i ) \u2200 x i \u2032 s which satisfy \u2211 m i x i = y In this analogy, p(y) is the probability of observing total y passengers, x i s are the total number of passengers in each group, 8 In our example x 1 is the total number of passengers that drive alone and x 2 is total number of drivers that drive with their spouse, friend, colleague, neighbor, etc. 8 m i s are the sizes of each group, and \u03b7 i s are the proportion of each group. As will be discussed in Section 3, data specification, the availability of aggregate observations instead of transactional level data, prohibited us from using any conventional count data models, and required us to use computationally expensive models of compound Poisson processes and decompounding concepts. 3 Data specification and research question The data is composed of passenger booking information for a given flight. For a given long-haul route both from A to B and from B to A, the data begins on the date the first seat is booked on a given flight and ends when the flight departs or is full. 9 There is no overbooking to be considered. 9 A challenging feature of the data is that for each flight the data are available as non-regular snap shots, meaning that there is no regular pattern between the intervals that the data are reported; for example, it is possible to have a snap shot of data for January 19th-2010, January 21st-2010, and January 29th-2010. We know the time path of bookings and therefore know the overall number of tickets sold for a specific flight for a given period; we can trace out the booking curve for the entire booking history for a given flight number. In addition to the flight number, the time of the flight, the date of the flight, and the price of the tickets are reported. Generally, there is intertemporal price discrimination and price rises as the departure data approaches. 10 Last minute travellers pay a higher fare than those booking weeks in advance of the flight. 10 The detailed data allowed us to create seasonal dummy variables in addition to the state of the economy dummy 11 The data on hand covered three years and spanned both the before and after recession periods. The dummy variable was set to be 1 for recession periods and zero for non-recession periods. 11 variable. Non-regular intervals between two successive snap shots added to the complexity of the estimation. The challenge is to estimate the price and time sensitivity for four different customer groups, singleton customers, couples, couples with a child, or group of size four, while controlling for season and income (GDP) effects. The most challenging aspect of the data on hand was that they were representing the aggregated number of tickets sold in a specific period of time. For example one could observe 20 tickets been purchased in a two day interval. Other than for this aggregated number, no additional information was available on the specific type of customers, i.e. how many of them were singleton customers, couples, couples with a child, or group of size 4. 12 We only considered four groups of customers and disregarded the bigger families because regarding families of three and families of four showed that the major proportion of customers are singletons and couples, therefore, including more groups will bring about only marginal effects. 12 The research question of this paper is to estimate the price elasticity and characteristics of different groups of customers such as singletons and couples in the absence of detailed information on how many tickets have been purchased by each of the groups of customers-or in the presence of aggregate information on demand in each period. Due to the data specification, and the availability of aggregate observation, the only feasible model to use among all models discussed in Section 2 was the compound Poisson model. Access to detailed transactional level data is necessary in using any other count model discussed in Section 2. 4 Econometric model We use the base model defined in Section 2.3 for Compound Poisson Processes. We will define the functional forms on Poisson Parameters \u03bb i s and we will use two models to find the parameters of interest for the functions defined for \u03bb i s. As previously discussed, successive observations in the data set on hand were recorded at non-regular intervals. The non-regular intervals (time periods) between two successive observations create complexity for the estimation. A solution to this problem is to use a well-known characteristic of Poisson distribution. If \u03bb is considered as the Poisson process parameter for a unit time interval, then \u03bb new = \u03bbt for an arbitrary interval t. In what follows we consider two different models: compound Poisson processes without additional error terms and compound Poisson processes with additional error terms. 4.1 Model 1\u2013Compound Poisson process Keeping in mind that the process of interest is Y = \u2211 i = 1 n m i N m i { t } , we assumed N i s are independent from each other and also each N i is a Poisson process. In order to introduce the first model, two assumptions are made. The first assumption is that the customers are either singletons, couples, couples with a child, or couples with two children. 13 Section 5 will justify why this assumption is not a restrictive one. 13 The second assumption is that the aggregate number of customers, Y, in each snap shot is less than 25, so any observation larger than 25 is censored in the empirical analysis. 14 Section 4.5 will describe why this assumption should be made. 14 The \u03bb i s, the Poisson parameters of N i s, are assumed to have the functional form of (6). (6) \u03bb i = e \u2211 q = 1 Q \u03b8 q , i X q X q s are independent variables and \u03b8 q,i s are parameters to be estimated. Throughout the paper, aggregate observations are all integer numbers. In addition to the variables, only Y-the aggregate amount of purchased tickets-were available; in this situation it was not possible to know the total number of events produced by each process. Finally we assume the likelihood functions to be introduced in Eqs. (7) and (8) have unique optimizers. 15 The global optimal solutions of Maximum Likelihood functions are consistent estimators for parameters of interest. There is only one consistent estimator for parameters of interest if the Maximum Likelihood problem has a unique solution. 15 The following notation is used in specifying the likelihood functions. Define set: G Y as the combination of all sets of g i \u2208 Z such that \u2211 i m i g i = Y . For example, for m 1 =1, m 2 =2, and m 3 =3, G 5 is defined as G 5 ={{5,0,0}, {3,1,0}, {1,2,0}, {0,1,1}, {2,0,1}}. Since 5=5*1+0*2+0*3, the first subset of G 5 is {5,0,0}. G i,j corresponds to jth subset of set G i , and g i,j corresponds to jth element of ith subset of G i . For instance, G 5,1 ={5,0,0}, and g 1,1 =5, g 1,2 =0, g 1,3 =0, etc. It is now possible to introduce the likelihood function for k observations. (7) l = \u220f k \u2211 j = 1 size { G Y k } \u220f i = 1 4 ( \u03bb i T k ) g j , i e - \u03bb i T k g j , i ! ; \u03bb i = e \u2211 q = 1 Q \u03b8 q , i X q And the log likelihood function can be written as (8) L = log l = \u2211 k log \u2211 j = 1 size { G Y k } \u220f i = 1 4 ( \u03bb i T k ) g j , i e - \u03bb i T k g j , i ! ; \u03bb i = e \u2211 q = 1 Q \u03b8 q , i X q In this setting, X q s are observed variables, and \u03b8 q,i s are the parameters that need to be estimated. It is not feasible to further simplify the likelihood functions. Therefore, finding the closed form solution for asymptotic results is not possible. However, it is feasible to write the objective function as in (8) for the likelihood function, and run the maximization/minimization problem. Showing that L in (7) has a bounded solution is straightforward. L, and all elements of L are smooth functions, therefore, are differentiable in all real numbers. Moreover, for vector X q >0 it is straightforward to show: (9) lim \u03b8 q , i \u2192 \u00b1 \u221e L = - \u221e (10) lim \u03b8 q , i \u2192 - \u221e \u2202 L \u2202 \u03b8 q , i = 1 (11) lim \u03b8 q , i \u2192 + \u221e \u2202 L \u2202 \u03b8 q , i = - \u221e It is also easy to show that if \u03b8 q,i s are set to zero, L has a bounded solution which is always superior to the results of (10). This fact together with Eqs. (9)\u2013(11) are sufficient for the Maximization problem of (7) to be bounded. 4.2 Model 2\u2013Compound Poisson process with error terms Generally, adding the error term to the Poisson distribution will make the computations complex, though, the complexity provides a benefit in that the models will become more flexible. It is well known that the expected value and the variance of Poisson distributions are identical, which can be restrictive. However, adding an extra error term to the Poisson distributions will give us the flexibility of having expected values that differ from the variance of the models. A necessary property of the error terms is that they must be positive. This is because the error term is added to a Poisson parameter and these parameters should be greater than zero. One functional form to consider is e \u03f5 i , and any arbitrary distribution could be regarded for the \u03f5 i s. If the constant terms in \u03bb i s are considered, then without loss of generality E ( e \u03f5 i ) = 1 . For the sake of convenience, assume that u i = e ( \u03f5 i ) is distributed as a gamma distribution \u03b3(\u03b1, \u03b2), with pdf: (12) u \u03b1 - 1 e ( - u | \u03b2 ) \u03b2 \u03b1 \u0393 ( \u03b1 ) By assuming a gamma distribution the computations are simplified. By setting E ( e ( \u03f5 i ) ) = 1 and \u03b2 = 1 \u03b1 , it is straightforward to show, \u03b2 = 1 \u03b1 = \u03b7 2 = Variance ( e \u03f5 i ) ; (Hausman et al., 1984). Moreover, the conditional distribution of Poisson occurrences, g j,i s, with Poisson parameter \u03bb i for a time interval T k given independent variables will form a negative binomial distribution given as: (13) \u0393 1 \u03b7 2 + g j , i \u0393 1 \u03b7 2 \u0393 ( g j , i + 1 ) ( \u03b7 2 \u03bb i T k ) g j , i ( 1 + \u03b7 2 \u03bb i T k ) - 1 \u03b7 2 + g j , i ; \u03bb i = e \u2211 q = 1 Q \u03b8 q , i X q where \u0393 ( z ) = \u222b 0 \u221e t z - 1 e - t dt Assuming the error terms for each Poisson process are independent of each other, and the variance of the Poisson process i is \u03b7 i 2 , the likelihood function can be written as: (14) L = log ( l ) = log \u220f k \u2211 j = 1 size { G Y k } \u220f i = 1 4 \u0393 1 \u03b7 i 2 + g j , i \u0393 1 \u03b7 i 2 \u0393 ( g j , i + 1 ) \u03b7 i 2 \u03bb i T k g j , i 1 + \u03b7 i 2 \u03bb i T k - 1 \u03b7 i 2 + g j , i ; \u03bb i = e \u2211 q = 1 Q \u03b8 q , i X q or (15) L = log ( l ) = \u2211 k log \u2211 j = 1 size { G Y k } \u220f i = 1 4 \u0393 1 \u03b7 i 2 + g j , i \u0393 1 \u03b7 i 2 \u0393 ( g j , i + 1 ) \u03b7 i 2 \u03bb i T k g j , i 1 + \u03b7 i 2 \u03bb i T k - 1 \u03b7 i 2 + g j , i ; \u03bb i = e \u2211 q = 1 Q \u03b8 q , i X q Maximum Likelihood procedures enable us to estimate \u03b8 q,i s and \u03b7 i s in the model. 4.3 Constructing confidence intervals To begin, \u03b8 \u02c6 is defined as the vector of estimated parameters using the MLE. If certain conditions hold, the maximum likelihood estimator will have the following asymptotic result. 16 The conditions which need to hold in order to find the variance\u2013covariance matrix are as follows: (see Newey and McFadden, 1994) 1. f(x\u2223\u03b8)>0 is twice differentiable and continuous in some neighbourhood of \u03b8 \u02c6 , 2. \u222b \u2016 \u25bd \u03b8 \u2016 dx < \u221e , 3. \u222b \u2016 \u25bd \u03b8 \u03b8 \u2016 dx < \u221e , 4. I = E[\u25bd \u03b8 ln f(x\u2223\u03b8) \u25bd \u03b8 lnf(x\u2223\u03b8)\u2032] exists and is non-singular, 5. E[sup \u03b8 \u2225\u25bd \u03b8\u03b8 lnf(x\u2223\u03b8)\u2225]<\u221e. 16 (16) n ( \u03b8 \u02c6 - \u03b8 0 ) \u2192 d N ( 0 , I - 1 ) where I = E[\u25bd \u03b8\u03b8 ln f(x\u2223\u03b8 0)], f (\u00b7) is the distribution function, and x is the vector of observations. \u03b8 is the vector of parameters of the model and I is called a Fisher information matrix. The computational aspects of the problem are discussed in Section 4.5. 4.4 Parameters to be estimated and Possible sources of endogeneity As noted earlier, singletons, couples, groups of three, and groups of four are the four groups of customers considered in this research. The objective is to estimate the price sensitivity of different types of customers, the sensitivity of different groups of customers to the time to the flight, the sensitivity of different groups of customers in recession and non-recession periods, and also the sensitivity of different groups with respect to seasonality. Price is generally considered endogenous in airline markets. It is a decision variable of airlines and does affect the customers\u2019 decision on whether or not to travel. The market structure will also influence the level and structure of fares. Fortunately, the data used in this paper are from an airline that recently entered a route. With a lack of competition, the airline learned the demand function in the market by varying its prices. The large difference in prices, which vary from $100 to $700, would support this assumption. The data also suggest that the airline is not using any source of price differentiation, and this assures that prices are not set based on characteristics of different groups. This will alleviate the endogeneity problem. Finally, there is only one fare class-economy. 4.5 Computational challenges With continual increases in computational power, and increasingly efficient numerical methods being introduced, problems which seemed intractable a few years ago, are now being solved. For this research, we used a six-core Xenon-based workstation to estimate the parameters and construct the confidence intervals. Depending on the size of the data and initial values, the time it took to estimate the parameters varied. The data sets are depicted in Section 3 and had 42,007 and 43,918 observations respectively. This research is among the first \u2013 if not the first \u2013 that handled such a large data set composed of over 40,000 observations-and estimated more than 20 parameters for each model in a decompounding context. It is worth noting that the optimization problems contained more than one million non-linear terms, and estimating each of the models took 2\u201330days of computation with the most powerful workstation on the market. We believe such a computational achievement can motivate researchers to use some of the models developed 30years ago and left mostly as theories due to the complexity of computation. In order to construct confidence intervals for the estimated parameters, the Hessian matrix of the process for every single observation must be evaluated. This process takes as much or sometime more time than finding the parameters. From the computational perspective, the main difference between constructing the confidence intervals and finding the parameters of interest is the ability to use parallel versus serial processing. It is feasible to divide a data set into many sub groups and use different processors to compute the Hessian matrix for each sub group of data, and then combine the results. This means, if a six-core processor is being used, all six cores can be used while constructing the confidence intervals by dividing data into six sub groups and subsequently combining the results. In contrast, to estimate the parameters, the objective function in the maximization/minimization problem consisted of all of the observations in the data set. Therefore, the computation process in parameter estimation is a serial computation. Since the objective function is non-linear, and the approximation methods that are used for this research are all numerical, the initial values are important. The objective function is not necessarily concave and therefore there is always the possibility of local maximums/minimums. One method that can be used to ensure the results are not local maximums is to use significantly different initial values, and if the results after using different initial values converge to one solution, it is likely this is the global optimum solution. 17 If by using different initial values one ended up with different results, as many initial values as possible should be tried and be compared to the objective values of optimum solutions to decide which one is globally optimum (or at least closest to the globally optimum point). 17 Recall the functional forms of the Poisson parameters are in the form of \u03bb i = e \u2211 q = 1 Q \u03b8 q , i X q . Finding large negative values for \u03b8 q,i s, for any specific i, will ensure large confidence intervals for \u03b8 q,i s. In these cases the cells of the Fisher index will become quite small and therefore will assure high values for the inverse form of the matrix. Finding such high values will result in large confidence intervals which is not desirable. Standardizing the data set, mapping all data to [\u22121,1] interval can reduce the computational time. This condition will dramatically increase the computation time. Dividing all of the data points by the maximum value of the absolute numbers of the set will map data between \u22121 and 1. The last comment on solving the Maximum likelihood optimization problem is on large factorial numbers. It is necessary to censor observations that have values of more than 25. 18 For some softwares it is safer to censor observations which have values more than 15. 18 Factorials grow very quickly and will result in large computational errors. In this research, more than 99% of our observations had values of less than 25. 5 Empirical results There are two measures of demand sensitivity that are of interest, the price elasticity, and the marginal effect. In this research, though it is not feasible to show elasticities and marginal effects in a conventional way, elasticities and marginal effects can be computed for any point of observation. The complex structure of the functional forms precludes the simplification of these two distinct definitions. The only straightforward concepts that can be taken into account are the signs of the parameters of interest. Since Exp() is a monotonic and increasing function, a positive sign in the parameter affirms a positive relation between the corresponding variable of the parameter with the outcome; if the variable increases, the outcome will increase. Similarly, a negative coefficient asserts a negative relationship between the variable and the outcome. Economic theory predicts a negative relationship between the price and purchases. Economic intuition also suggests that a negative correlation would exist between the amount of time before the flight and the number of tickets purchased. 19 The simple gravity model would support this conclusion. 19 The underlying rationale is that last minute travellers are generally business travellers and these are also generally singletons. Larger groups require more coordination and therefore can and generally will purchase tickets well before the flight departure date. Ticket prices also tend to be lower up to within two weeks of the flight. It is also well documented that as GDP or the growth of GDP goes down, air travel declines; 2009 is a good example of precisely this phenomenon when, during the recession and financial crises, air travel fell in some markets by more than 20% (see The Daily Mail Report, 2009). Finally, for a given price and given period of time leading up to the flight, and the same economic situation, we expect to have more ticket purchases in the June\u2013November period for the Christmas break. For different groups of customers we have some predictions. Business travellers are generally traveling alone, whereas leisure travellers are mostly couples and families. Therefore, singleton passengers are expected to be less price sensitive than couples, families of size 3, and families of size 4. 20 If fares are too high, families or couples may switch modes or not travel at all. A fare increase of $Xs would be an \u2018n *$X\u2019 increase in total expenditures, where n is the size of the group traveling. 20 For the second model specification, with a separate variance term, some predictions can be made before running the model. The singleton group is composed of travellers who could be business or leisure travellers. This heterogeneity may bring about some variations in purchasing behaviour. In the case of couples, or two passengers who are traveling together, they can be two business passengers traveling together, two leisure passengers traveling with each other, or a business passenger traveling with his/her spouse. So again we expect to observe more variance in the behaviour of couples than singletons. This trend can be observed in its extreme case for groups of 4. The most likely combination of customers for groups of 4, are either 2 couples traveling together, or a family of size 4. It is also possible that a family of size 3 travels with another passenger. However, the latter case is less feasible than the first two scenarios. Due to the different nature of different groups of size 4, we do expect to observe more variability, therefore, more variance for the case of groups of 4. The results of the models for two different routes are summarized in Tables 1\u20134 . The coefficients are consistent with prior expectations. As a general rule, singletons are less price sensitive than couples, and couples are less price sensitive than groups of three, and groups of three are less price sensitive than groups of four. Another result reflected in the second column of the tables illustrates the sensitivity of customers to the time leading up to the flight. The results show, with everything else fixed, that the closer the time leading up to the flight is, the more that customers are likely to buy tickets. The recession had a negative effect on all types of passengers. The results show that the effect of the recession is moderately small for singleton passengers whereas the effect is large for other groups of passengers, most likely the leisure passenger. The output of the model shows how the volume of travel by singleton passengers remains the same in the high season and the low season and how other groups of passengers tend to buy more tickets in the high season. Finally, as expected, the larger the size of the group, the more the variance of the behaviour of the group. For Poisson processes with parameter \u03bb i = e \u2211 q = 1 Q \u03b8 q , i X q , it is straightforward to show (17) E ( Y | X 1 , X 2 , \u2026 , X Q , i ) = \u03bb i = e \u2211 q = 1 Q \u03b8 q , i X q \u2192 ln ( E ( Y | X 1 , X 2 , \u2026 , X Q , i ) ) = \u2211 q = 1 Q \u03b8 q , i X q \u2192 \u2202 ln ( E ( Y | X q \u2208 { 1 , \u2026 , Q } , i ) ) \u2202 X q \u2208 { 1 , \u2026 , Q } = \u03b8 q , i Therefore, the \u03b8 q,i s provide a measure of the percentage change in demand given a unit increase in an independent variable. It is possible to calculate the change in demand for each of the four demand groups given a change in any of the three variables used in the estimation; ticket price, seasonality and time. We can show the expected percentage change in demand for groups of 1, 2, 3, and 4 due to a change of $X in ticket price. Similarly it is possible to examine the percentage difference in demand between high season and low season or the difference in demand between yesterday and today, or between today and tomorrow (two successive days) for each of the groups. The interpretation of the results in this way is, in our view, as informative as notions of elasticities and marginal effects. The calculations require the data to be transformed back to their original values by dividing the coefficients by the largest values of price and the time variable, since the data had been standardized to interval 0 and 1. (1 Representing the highest observed value.) It is possible to compute elasticities as well as marginal effects but the values would be calculated for each data point. The elasticities can be calculated as: (18) \u2202 ln E ( Y | X q \u2208 { 1 , \u2026 , Q } , i ) \u2202 ln X q \u2208 { 1 , \u2026 , Q } = \u03b8 q , i X q The elasticities depend only on the values of the estimated parameters, and corresponding variables. It is possible to depict price elasticities of demand in a two dimensional space. The result that can be obtained from any Poisson regression is that by increasing the price, the elasticity will increase. The results are illustrated in Fig. 1 for each of the demand groups.In the tables, the elasticities are calculated based on standardized data. For each group of customers, the coefficient of variable price represents the elasticity of demand for the highest observed price. The marginal effect can be computed by the following equation: (19) \u2202 E ( Y | X q \u2208 { 1 , \u2026 , Q } , i ) \u2202 X q \u2208 { 1 , \u2026 , Q } = \u03b8 q , i e \u2211 q = 1 Q \u03b8 q , i X q The marginal effects depend not only on each particular parameter and their corresponding values, but also on all of the values of the other parameters. As an illustration, using the first data set and the second model that was estimated, the following calculation can be made: \u2022 each $12.00 increase in the ticket price will result in a 1% decrease in demand by singletons. \u2022 each $1.42 increase in the ticket price will result in a 1% decrease in demand by couples. \u2022 each $1.36 increase in the ticket price will result in a 1% decrease in demand by groups of three. \u2022 each $0.64 increase in the ticket price will result in a 1% decrease in demand by groups of four. It is clear that as the size of the group increases, the price sensitivity increases as well. Any price increase is multiplied by the size of the group so that the amount paid can become quite large. These differences in price sensitivity provide an opportunity to use yield management across groups to increase total revenue per flight. Price differentiation can be used especially for those flights that have load factors of less than 100%. At first glance such a difference in price sensitivity among different groups of customers may seem counter intuitive. To better grasp the meaning of the numbers, it is worthwhile to look at the proportion of different groups of customers in the market. In order to find the proportion of the customers that exist in each market, it is necessary to solve the likelihood function introduced in Eqs. (7) and (8) with only four parameters, i.e. only constants. After solving the MLE maximization problem, 65% of customers are singleton customers, 26% are couples, 4% are traveling as a group of 3, and 5% are traveling as a group of four. 21 Finding a greater percentage for group of 4 in comparison with group of 3 might be caused by the fact that two couples also form a group of 4. 21 It is commonsense that larger groups travel less frequently. Therefore, not considering these groups in the models does not affect the results. We use some examples to show how the estimated parameters can be used to predict the sensitivity of different groups to an increase in price. A $100 increase in the price will be translated in a 1 - 0.99 100 12 = 9 % decrease in the demand of singleton customers, 1 - 0.99 100 1.42 = 51 % decrease in the demand of couples, 1 - 0.99 100 1.36 = 52 % decrease in the demand of groups of three, and 1 - 0.99 100 0.64 = 79 % decrease in the demand of groups of four. Therefore, the overall decrease in demand due to a $100 increase in the price is 1\u2212((1\u22129%)*65%+(1\u221251%)*26%+(1\u221252)*4%+(1\u221279%)*5%)=26%. As Fig. 1 illustrates, the prices of tickets in the data set have always ranged between $100 and $700. It is not surprising to see that a $100 increase in an average price of $350 will result in a 26% decrease, roughly a one quarter loss, in overall demand. Fig. 2 shows the percentage of demand loss due to an increase in price with respect to a base price of $350. It is also possible to measure the relative proportion of different groups of travellers in each price range. Calculated numbers shows us that the proportion of singletons increases from the original 65% to ( 1 - 9 % ) * % 65 1 - 26 % = 79 % , the proportion of couples decreases from 26% to ( 1 - 51 % ) * % 26 1 - 26 % = 17 % , the proportion of customers who travel in groups of three decreases from 4% to ( 1 - 52 % ) * % 4 1 - 26 % = 2.5 % , and the proportion of customers who travel in groups of four decreases from 5% to ( 1 - 79 % ) * % 5 1 - 26 % = 1.5 % due to a $100 increase in the price of tickets from the average price. Fig. 3 shows how the proportion of different groups of customers change due to an increase in price with respect to a base price of $350. Apparently the proportion of singletons increases and the proportions of the rest of the groups decrease by increasing the price. It is possible to see how the timing of a flight will change demand. Our estimates suggest that for each week closer to the departure date, the demand by single customers will increase by 11%; for couples, groups of three, and groups of four, the corresponding values are 166%, 244%, and 4.48%respectively. These non-intuitive results seem to reflect the non-linear pattern of customer arrival times for couples and groups of three. For groups of four it seems intuitive since such a large group would have to plan well before the flight departure date. For couples and groups of three it may be a few will come into the market well before the departure date, then a large number show up, for example three to eight weeks prior to the flight and then very few just prior to departure. Our model is not powerful enough to capture this trend, therefore, not reliable for time parameters. The estimated results based on Model 2 presented in Table 4 suggests that the average demand in recession periods for singletons, couples, groups of three, and groups of four, was correspondingly 1 - 1 1 + 0.8 = 7 % , 1 - 1 1 + 0.70 = 41 % , 1 - 1 1 + 1.3 = 56 % , 1 - 1 1 + 0.60 = 37 % less than non-recession periods. The weighted average demand loss of different groups of customers on that specific route suggests that in recession periods, on average, 20% of demand is lost. Using the same method and arguments for the Seasonal Dummy Variable suggests that the total demand of passengers increases 15% in high seasons. 22 The results of Seasonal Variables suggested a 50% decrease in demand for couples. Such an odd result might come from strong collinearity between Price Variable and Seasonal Variable. The results for Seasonal variables are not as reliable as other estimated parameters. 22 The interesting observation is that the effect of a recession on demand is larger than the effect of the seasonality shift. In other words the total demand loss in recession periods exceeds the demand loss due to low season effect. In order to compare the computed elasticities of each group with what exists in the literature, it is necessary to find a weighted average of all of the different elasticities for different groups of customers. As illustrated in Fig. 1, depending on the price elasticity of singleton customers, the price elasticity varies between 0.07 for minimum price and 0.47 for maximum price. It varies between 0.6 and 4.2 for couples, between 0.7 and 4.5 for groups of 3, and between 1.6 and 9 for groups of 4. The weighted average of all elasticities results in elasticities between 0.31 at the minimum observed price, and 2.03 at the maximum observed price. In Oum et al. (1992), a summary of all empirical papers on passenger air travel elasticities up to 1992 were reported to be from 0.18 to 0.62 using choice models, 0.42\u20131.98 for leisure travellers estimated with time series methodology, and 1.52 for cross-section. Elasticity for business travellers were reported to be 0.65 in time series models, and 1.15 in cross-section methods. Gillen and Morrison (2007) reported on the summary of air travel elasticities found in the literature. The demand elasticity for long-haul domestic leisure travellers is reported to be between 0.44 and 3.2. The weighted average of elasticities in our current research seems to be completely in line with what has been found in the literature. In order to compare two alternative models, Pseudo R 2s are computed for each set of data and each type of model. The results of Pseudo R 2 are presented in Table 5 . The results suggest that the models with error terms are capable of capturing two to three percent more variability in the data in comparison to models without error terms. Fig. 4 shows the expected frequency predicted from the models with the actual frequencies observed in the data set. The dotted lines correspond to models, and the histograms correspond to actual observations. 6 Conclusion and discussion This paper reports on our research to estimate price sensitivity, sensitivity to the time until departure, sensitivity to recession, and finally sensitivity to seasonal demand variability, for four different groups of customer-singletons, couples, groups of three, and groups of four. The data were composed of two-way information on a Canadian long-haul route and were composed of aggregate demand, therefore it was impossible to be directly used to estimate the demand sensitivities for each group of customers. Two models based on compound Poisson processes were considered. Both models considered exponential functional forms on variables for Poisson parameters. The second model considered additional error terms. The estimated results based on our chosen route suggest that on average 65% of customers are singletons, 26% are couples, and only 9% are either groups of three or four. The results showed a huge difference between the sensitivity of customers of different groups with respect to price. The model predicts that adding $100 to the average price of $350 will result in an overall 26% reduction in total demand and changing the proportions of customers to 79% singletons, 17% couples, and only 4% either group of three or group of four. The results show the impact of the recession has led to an overall 20% loss of demand. The loss of demand was the least severe with singletons with a 7% decrease in demand and the most severe for groups of three with a 56% loss in demand. The results also suggest that demand will decrease by 15% in the low season. The difference in magnitude of the effect of a recession on different groups of customers suggests airlines can offset some of their loss in recession periods by offering different packages of prices to different sized groups of customers. The weighted average elasticity is computed to be in the range of 0.31 at the minimum observed price and 2.03 at the maximum observed price. For singletons it is between 0.07 for minimum price and 0.47 for maximum price. For couples, the price elasticity varied between 0.6 and 4.2, for groups of three it varied between 0.7 and 4.5, and for groups of four the variation was between 1.6 and 9. Due to such differences in the price elasticity of different groups, price differentiation can potentially increase both the airline\u2019s profit and the total welfare. 23 In theory, third degree price discrimination will not necessarily lead to more profit or more welfare. Whether or not such a strategy results in more profit or more total welfare depends on specifics of the market under study (see Varian, 1989). 23 The results of the models, and their alignment with economic theory, affirms the validity and strength of the models. The integer numbers are the key elements of the model. If the observations were not in discrete numbers, the models would not be useful. In our models, each observation on aggregate number of passengers \u2013 each integer number \u2013 looks like the DNA which contains significantly more information than what could be imagined. 7 Future research suggestions Our current modeling estimation technique which is based on Poisson random sums \u2013 compound Poisson process \u2013 and aggregate level observation cannot distinguish between two different types of customers which have the same group sizes. For example we treat business and economy class single passengers the same way, and the two friends who travel together and a couple are treated the same way. Most likely the model that can solve such a problem in the presence of aggregate level data could be called the mix-compound Poisson model or compound-mix Poisson model-combination of the models introduced in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. An interesting research question that is left to answer is how much different types of each group size of passengers are sensitive to price, seasonality, recession, and timing.

Appendix A Simple Poisson models It can be informative to run simple Poisson models on the data on hand and compare the results of price elasticities between the simple Poisson models and the results introduced in compound Poisson models. One of the difficulties we faced even in running simple Poisson models was non-equal time intervals between the successive observations. Fortunately in simple Regression models it was easy to show that the maximum likelihood optimization problem was globally concave and as a result we were able to find the values of interest in a couple of seconds.

If we compare these results with the results of the first models of both data sets we would observe that the results are very similar. For example the results of applying the first model on the first data set suggest that the elasticity is between 0.28 and 1.72 and for the second data set the elasticity is between 0.22 and 1.38.
