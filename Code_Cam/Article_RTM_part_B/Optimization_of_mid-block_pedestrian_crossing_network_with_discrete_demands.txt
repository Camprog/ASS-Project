"Transportation Research Part B: MethodologicalOptimization of mid-block pedestrian crossing network with discrete demandsAbstract In many cases, pedestrian crossing demands are distributed discretely along an arterial segment. Demand origins, destinations and crosswalks comprise a pedestrian crossing network. An integrated model for optimizing the quantity, locations and signal settings of mid-block crosswalks simultaneously is proposed to best trade-off the operational performances between pedestrians and vehicles. Pedestrian behavior of choosing crosswalks is captured under a discrete demand distribution. Detour distance and delay at signalized crosswalks are formulated as a measure of pedestrian crossing cost. Maximum bandwidths are modeled in analytical expressions as a measure of vehicular cost. To solve the proposed model, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) based algorithm is designed and employed to obtain the Pareto frontier efficiently. From the numerical study, it is found that there exists an optimal number of mid-block crosswalks. Excess available crosswalks may make no contributions to improvement in pedestrian cost when the constraint of the minimum interval between crosswalks and vehicular cost are taken into account. Two-stage crosswalks are more favorable than one-stage ones for the benefits of both pedestrian and vehicles. The study results show promising properties of the proposed method to assist transportation engineers in properly designing mid-block crosswalks along a road segment.serial JL 271728 291210 291772 291817 31 Transportation Research Part B: Methodological TRANSPORTATIONRESEARCHPARTBMETHODOLOGICAL 2015-02-21 2015-02-21 2015-03-12T20:17:41 1-s2.0-S0191261514002227 S0191-2615(14)00222-7 S0191261514002227 10.1016/j.trb.2014.12.005 S300 S300.1 FULL-TEXT 1-s2.0-S0191261514X00147 2015-05-14T05:39:52.915433-04:00 0 0 20150301 20150331 2015 2015-02-21T17:56:47.337429Z articleinfo articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright crossmark dateloaded dateloadedtxt datesearch datesort dateupdated dco docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid indexeddate issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdateend pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype ssids alllist content subj subheadings suppl tomb volfirst volissue volumelist webpdf webpdfpagecount yearnav figure table body mmlmath acknowledge affil articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authkeywords authlast grantnumber grantsponsor grantsponsorid highlightsabst primabst ref 0191-2615 01912615 true 73 73 C Volume 73 8 103 121 103 121 201503 March 2015 2015-03-01 2015-03-31 2015 article fla Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract In many cases, pedestrian crossing demands are distributed discretely along an arterial segment. Demand origins, destinations and crosswalks comprise a pedestrian crossing network. An integrated model for optimizing the quantity, locations and signal settings of mid-block crosswalks simultaneously is proposed to best trade-off the operational performances between pedestrians and vehicles. Pedestrian behavior of choosing crosswalks is captured under a discrete demand distribution. Detour distance and delay at signalized crosswalks are formulated as a measure of pedestrian crossing cost. Maximum bandwidths are modeled in analytical expressions as a measure of vehicular cost. To solve the proposed model, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) based algorithm is designed and employed to obtain the Pareto frontier efficiently. From the numerical study, it is found that there exists an optimal number of mid-block crosswalks. Excess available crosswalks may make no contributions to improvement in pedestrian cost when the constraint of the minimum interval between crosswalks and vehicular cost are taken into account. Two-stage crosswalks are more favorable than one-stage ones for the benefits of both pedestrian and vehicles. The study results show promising properties of the proposed method to assist transportation engineers in properly designing mid-block crosswalks along a road segment. Keywords Mid-block pedestrian crossing Pedestrian crosswalk network Discrete crossing demand Detour distance Maximum bandwidths 1 Introduction Pedestrians are the most vulnerable road users. The growing number of pedestrian fatalities has recently become a major safety problem, especially in developing countries, due to the high population density and rapid urbanization. Take China as an example, the crude pedestrian mortality increased from 7.0 to 10.3 per 100,000 population from 2006 to 2010 (Ma et al., 2013). Yet more than 70% of pedestrian injuries from street crossing occurred at mid-block (Chu, 2006) due to informal or illegal crossings resulting from lack of crosswalks and long waiting time on long sections between two adjacent intersections (Cherry et al., 2011). As a result, despite limited resources, traffic agencies have to spend a considerable amount of time and efforts in implementing workarounds to the mid-block pedestrian crossing problem. Methods that can shorten waiting time and detour distance as well as minimize impacts on vehicular traffic by properly locating and efficiently operation of mid-block crosswalks are most desirable. Indeed, current studies concerning pedestrian crossing mainly focus on pedestrian crossing behavior (Li, 2014; Wickramasinghe et al., 2012; Yannis et al., 2013) and signalization at at-grade intersections (Ma et al., 2014; Wong and Wong, 2003; Yang, 2010). Based on these, evaluations of pedestrian crossing safety (Guo et al., 2012; Koh et al., 2014) and service level (Baltes and Chu, 2002; Chu and Baltes, 2001) are further conducted. In contrast, there are few studies on mid-block crosswalk optimization, falling into two major categories: operation studies and location studies. Operation studies investigate the optimization of pedestrian crossing facility patterns and signal settings on the basis of given crossing locations usually. The facility patterns include un-signalized (Feng et al., 2009b; Gomez et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2007) or signalized (Dunn and Pretty, 1984; Yang et al., 2006) patterns with one-stage or two-stage crossing design, High-Intensity Activated Crosswalk (HAWK) (Fitzpatrick and Park, 2009; Vasudevan et al., 2011) and Pedestrian User-Friendly Intelligent Crossing (PUFFIN) (Lu and Noyce, 2009). The objectives of these studies were to examine suitable warrant provisions for different patterns as well as to enhance both safety and efficiency of crossing pedestrians while considering the delay of vehicle flows (Ma et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2010; Van Houten et al., 2007). In the category of mid-block pedestrian crosswalk location studies, besides general guidance in manuals (FHWA, 2009; NACTO, 2013; Yang, 2003), most optimization approaches premise on a given demand pattern and operation pattern (Cao et al., 2010; Dan, 2011). The problem is mainly to determine the number of crosswalks and corresponding locations. Typically pedestrian crossing demands are assumed to be distributed uniformly along a road segment for simplicity (Feng et al., 2009a,b; Lu et al., 2002). It implies that the crossing purpose of pedestrians is just to move to the other side of the road without a specific destination, while it is far from reality because any crossing pedestrian has a specific origin and destination such as a shopping mall or subway station. Moreover, in order to simplify the problem, the number and locations of crosswalks are usually optimized based on given candidate sites (Feng et al., 2009b). However, in reality, it may not be easy to generate all the possible candidate sites, especially under a long section with many distributed pedestrian crossing demand origin and destination (OD) pairs and unbalanced demand distribution. It is also noticed that most optimization models are based on the perspective of crossing pedestrians alone, while ignoring the signal impacts of mid-block crosswalks on vehicles (Cao et al., 2010; Dan, 2011). Indeed, the impacts of crosswalks cannot be neglected especially when the two intersections are coordinated with each other because adding one or more crosswalks and pedestrian crossing signals may shrink bandwidth significantly. Despite the informative results offered by previous studies, many issues on this subject have not been sufficiently addressed. The assumption of uniform distribution of pedestrian crossing demand is not realistic. Indeed, the origin or destination of a crossing pedestrian is probably a bus/subway station or a community/shopping center, but not evenly distributed along the street. The crossing purpose is scarcely just crossing the street itself, which the uniform distribution in the literature implies. It is noticed that a maximum distance interval between crosswalks is suggested in the literature (Feng et al., 2009a; Lu et al., 2002; Yang, 2003) to control pedestrian detour distance when uniform demand distribution is assumed. However, this ideology is invalid under the discrete distribution. Separate consideration of location and operation problems of crosswalks may produce sub-optimal results. It is also evidenced that designing crosswalks by choosing optimal ones from candidate sites is a subjective judgment itself. Moreover, in the process of designing pedestrian crossing network along an arterial, it is desired that both vehicular and pedestrian delay be considered in an integrated framework. Considering the conflicting operational features between pedestrian and vehicular traffic, a multi-objective approach may be preferable to capture the trade-off between the performances of the two inter-dependent traffic modes. Recently methods dealing with a multi-objective optimization problem have been developed. In a trade-off analysis, a solution a dominates another solution b if a is superior to or at least equal to b with regard to all of the objectives and a is superior to b at least for one objective (Nakayama et al., 2009). A solution is called a Pareto solution if it is not dominated by any other solutions. Obviously Pareto solutions are superior to non-Pareto ones. Thus it is more meaningful to conduct a trade-off analysis between Pareto solutions rather than any feasible ones. All Pareto solutions comprise a Pareto frontier, with which the relationship between different objectives can be investigated. And the Pareto frontier has been adopted in transportation researches (Bai et al., 2014). To properly address the above research needs, this paper develops a new model featuring a multi-objective framework for optimizing the quantity, location and signalization of a pedestrian crosswalk network. Two objectives are considered, namely minimizing the crossing cost for pedestrians and maximizing the bandwidths for vehicles. The discrete distribution of pedestrian crossing demands is modeled as OD pairs. The quantity and locations of mid-block crosswalks are optimized. NSGA II is adopted as the solution algorithm to portray the Pareto frontier. This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the specific optimization problem of a mid-block pedestrian crossing network. In Section 3 an integrated optimization model for best trade-off between operations of pedestrians and vehicles is developed. The solution algorithm is discussed in Section 4. To illustrate the model a numerical example study is conducted in Section 5. Finally conclusion remarks are offered in Section 6. 2 Problem description and notations 2.1 Mid-block pedestrian crossing network description Fig. 1 (a) shows a road segment of an arterial between two adjacent intersections, Intersections I and II. Different from previous studies (Feng et al., 2009b; Lu et al., 2002), the pedestrian crossing demands are distributed discretely along the segment. Rectangles represent origin or destination points of demands. They can be subway stations, communities or shopping centers. They are determined by the entrance locations of those facilities. Four rectangles at corners are special ODs where pedestrians get into or out of the segment. In most cases, a crossing pedestrian comes from one of these rectangles and goes to another one rectangle. Two points from the two segment sides can be called an OD pair. All the OD pairs comprise a table of an OD matrix. Besides the two available crosswalks at Intersections I and II, more mid-block crosswalks are supposed to be added. They can be one-stage or two-stage crossing design. Obviously the setting of mid-block crosswalks is influenced by the demand distribution. Insufficient crosswalks result in longer detour distance and consequently pedestrians\u2019 lack of adherence to traffic regulations (Sisiopiku and Akin, 2003). However, excessive crosswalks lead to resource waste and delay of vehicles. In Fig. 1(b) is a transformed pedestrian crossing network. Rectangles are origin or destination points as those in Fig. 1(a). Black dots represent starting/ending points of crosswalks at curbsides, and black circles represent starting \u29f9 ending points of crosswalks at Refuge Island if two-stage crosswalks are used. If two black circles are covered by each other, it means this is a one-stage crosswalk. Connecting arcs between rectangles (pedestrian ODs) and black dots (starting \u29f9 ending points of crosswalks at curbsides) are bi-directional with distance, which comprises crossing route impedance. Bi-directional connecting arcs between black dots and black circles represent pedestrian delay at curbside due to red signals. Connecting arcs between black circles represent pedestrian delay at Refuge Island due to offsets of pedestrian green signals for two stages. Note that, it is hard for crossing pedestrians to recognize differences of signal delay when choosing a crosswalk, and pedestrian delay at curbsides or Refuge Island have no impedance on crossing routes selection. Hence all components of the network within an ellipse can be taken as one node without any cost in pedestrian crossing route selection model. However, the delay of pedestrians at both curbsides and Refuge Island should be explicitly formulated and included in total actual pedestrian cost. 2.2 Assumptions To formulate the problem, the following assumptions are made: (a) There are two crosswalks existing at two adjacent intersections, and the signal timings for these two crosswalks (intersections) are given. (b) The pedestrian crossing demands in this paper, who are classified as discrete demands, have a specific origin and destination. It is true that there are pedestrians who just randomly walk along the street. However, compared with this type of pedestrians, those who have a clearly specific destination are more concerned about the convenience of crosswalks. (c) The location of each pedestrian crossing origin\u2013destination (OD) pair as well as pedestrian speed is known beforehand. (d) Demands of OD pairs are given. In practice, the pedestrian crossing demands can be determined by peak hour values or average values obtained from traffic surveys, which is the usual case in Network Design Problems. (e) All pedestrians make the route choice when leaving the origin with provided information about all crosswalk locations by managers. (f) All pedestrians cross the street through crosswalks and obey crossing signals. 2.3 Notations To facilitate the model presentation, the key notations applied hereafter are summarized in Table 1 . 3 Model formulation In this section an optimization model for crosswalks is developed to balance the trade-off between operations of pedestrians and vehicles. The crossing cost of pedestrians includes detour distance and signal delay at crosswalks while impacts on vehicles are measured by the maximum bandwidths. The modeling process is undertaken in four steps. Pedestrian behavior of choosing crosswalks under the condition of discrete demand distribution is captured first. Then pedestrians\u2019 detour distance and delay model are formulated. An analytic model of maximum bandwidths is derived for vehicular cost. Based on these, the integrated model of optimizing the quantity, locations and signal settings of crosswalks is developed. 3.1 Pedestrian cost model 3.1.1 Pedestrian crossing route choice model Pedestrians\u2019 behavior of choosing a crossing route is complex. Generally, two factors have vital impacts on crossing route choice behaver of a pedestrian: detour distance and delay at crosswalk. However, it is very hardly for pedestrians to perceive signal delay even after they reached the target crosswalk. Although in reality a pedestrian may choose a downstream crosswalk hoping to minimize waiting delay when an upstream crosswalk signal shows red, it is not guaranteed that the delay can be minimized indeed (i.e. he may encounter red signal at the last crosswalk and the red signal may last longer than those of passed crosswalks). Therefore, for simplicity, only detour distance is regarded as crossing route impedance in this paper for simplicity as recommended in the literatures (Guo et al., 2014; Sisiopiku and Akin, 2003). Nevertheless, more factors besides detour distance are worth to be investigated in future, and the crossing route choice model can also be extended to a dynamic one as proposed by Papadimitriou (2012) to address more considerations in future research. Fig. 1(b) shows that pedestrian behavior of choosing a crosswalk is related to crossing route impedance. Fig. 2 illustrates two available crosswalks, namely crosswalk k and k +1, for pedestrians from i to j. Accordingly, there exist two possible routes (i.e. Routes 1 and 2 shown as dashed lines). And the detour distance of taking crosswalk k (i.e. Route 1) is: (1) D k ij = | X i - x k | + | X j - x k | - | X i - X j | ( i , j ) \u2208 RS , k = 1 , \u2026 , N where |Xi \u2212 Xj | is the distance between i and j. |Xi \u2212 xk | or |Xj \u2212 xk | are the distance between Crosswalk k and i or j respectively. The minimum detour distance D min ij is calculated as: (2) D min ij = min k D k ij ( i , j ) \u2208 RS , k = 1 , \u2026 , N The set of crosswalks used by pedestrians from i to j, denoted by Kij , is defined as: (3) K ij = k | D k ij - D min ij \u2a7d \u03b8 ( i , j ) \u2208 RS , k = 1 , \u2026 , N which means that some longer routes are also used due to the distance perception of different pedestrians. For instance, Route 2 in Fig. 2 may be preferred as well though Rout 1 is the shortest. Parameter \u03b8 is supposed to be calibrated through surveys as distance conception differs in different sceneries (Loomis et al., 1996). A multinomial logit model is applied to determine the possibility of choosing crosswalk k for pedestrians from i to j: (4) P k ij = e - D k ij \u2211 k \u0303 \u2208 K ij e - D k \u0303 ij k \u2208 K ij 0 otherwise ( i , j ) \u2208 RS , k = 1 , \u2026 , N Once the possibility of choosing a crosswalk is obtained, the total pedestrian detour distance can be calculated by the following Eq. (5) (5) D \u203e = \u2211 ( i , j ) \u2208 RS \u2211 k \u2208 K ij F ij P k ij D k ij \u2211 ( i , j ) \u2208 RS F ij In Eq. (5), \u2211 ( i , j )\u2208 RSFij is the sum of demands of all OD pairs and F ij P k ij D k ij is the total detour distance of pedestrians choosing crosswalk k from OD pair (i, j). Thus D \u203e is the demand weighted detour distance. 3.1.2 Pedestrian delay model Besides detour distance, delay is another key factor when evaluating the level of service for crossing pedestrians (Petritsch et al., 2005). A pedestrian signal cycle usually consists of three display intervals: the pedestrian Walk interval, the Flashing Don\u2019t Walk (FDW) clearance interval, and the Don\u2019t Walk or Stop interval (Wang and Tian, 2010). As the crossing delay increases pedestrians become less likely to wait for the pedestrian Walk interval (Tiwari et al., 2007). In the following process of calculating delay, effective green intervals for pedestrians are simplified as the Walk intervals: (6) g k u = t pk ue - t pk ub k = 1 , \u2026 , N (7) g k d = t pk de - t pk db k = 1 , \u2026 , N The pedestrian crossing demands {Fij |(i, j)\u2208 RS} are assumed to keep constant in the study period for simplicity. In this case pedestrians arrive at crosswalks randomly at uniform rates. One-stage Crossing: The average delay model at a one-stage crossing design in Pretty (1979) is described as: (8) d k u = 0.5 \u00d7 C - g k u 2 C k = 1 , \u2026 , N (9) d k d = 0.5 \u00d7 C - g k d 2 C k = 1 , \u2026 , N Two-stage Crossing: The delay model at a two-stage crossing design in Wang and Tian (2010) is adopted. The total average delay of crossing from the upstreet curbside is specified as the sum of two parts: (10) d k u = d k 1 u + d k 2 u k = 1 , \u2026 , N where d k 1 u and d k 2 u are the average delay in the first and second stage respectively. d k 1 u is calculated as a one-stage crossing delay: (11) d k 1 u = 0.5 \u00d7 C - g k u 2 C And d k 2 u consists of two parts: (12) d k 2 u = C - g k u C d k 2 r u + g k u C d k 2 g u where d k 2 r u and d k 2 g u are the average delay of the first (arriving during the Flashing Don\u2019t Walk and Stop intervals of Stage 1) and second (arriving during the Walk interval of Stage 1) wave of pedestrians respectively. d k 2 r u is determined as: (13) d k 2 r u = t t < C - g k d 0 t \u2a7e C - g k d with t = t pk db - t pk ub - w \u00b1 nC ( 0 \u2a7d t < C ) n = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , \u2026 d k 2 g u is calculated as follows : When t < g k u (14) d k 2 g u = 0.5 ( a + t ) 2 + a C - g k u g k u t + g k d < g k u 0.5 t 2 g k u g k u \u2a7d t + g k d \u2a7d C 0.5 C - g k d 2 g k u t + g k d > C When t \u2a7e g k u (15) d k 2 g u = t - 0.5 g k u t + g k d < C 0.5 b 2 + bc g k u C \u2a7d t + g k d \u2a7d C + g k u 0 t + g k d > C + g k u with t = t pk db - t pk ub - w \u00b1 nC ( 0 \u2a7d t < C ) n = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , \u2026 a = g k u - g k d - t b = g k u - g k d + C - t c = t - g k u In the same way, d k d , the total average delay of crossing from the downstreet curbside, is derived. Then the demand weighted delay of all pedestrians is obtained: (16) d \u00af = \u2211 ( i , j ) \u2208 RS \u2211 k \u2208 K ij F ij P k ij \u03b4 k ij \u00d7 d k u + 1 - \u03b4 k ij \u00d7 d k d \u2211 ( i , j ) \u2208 RS F ij with \u03b4 k ij = 1 if crossing from upstreet curbside through Crosswalk k from i to j 0 otherwise 3.2 Maximum bandwidth model As shown in Fig. 3 , signalized crosswalks are regarded as signalized intersections which have dramatic impacts on vehicles (Zheng, 2006). The fixed locations of crosswalks at Intersections I and II are denoted as x 1 and xN respectively. And the location of a mid-block crosswalk to be optimized is xk (1< k < N). The impacts are measured by the maximum bandwidths available (Zheng, 2006), whose objective is to keep traffic in platoons progressing. Wider bandwidths lead to less impacts on the arterial traffic flow. There is no doubt that the bandwidths are directly affected by the vehicle green interval start and end at each crosswalk. And these signal parameters are further related to crosswalk number and locations (Pillai et al., 1998). However, it is much easier to handle when several mid-block crosswalks are investigated compared with traditional vehicular delay based methods. Numerous models of generating maximum bandwidths are available (Little et al., 1981; Pillai et al., 1998). However, they need to solve a general linear mixed integer problem. In this paper a simple model is proposed to calculate maximum bandwidths. It is much more mathematically convenient in the solution process. It can be seen in Fig. 3 that maximum bandwidths are determined given the locations and traffic signals of crosswalks. They can be expressed analytically in terms of the starts and ends of vehicle green intervals as did in this paper. It should be noticed that, in essence, the proposed model is the same as those in previous researches (Little et al., 1981; Pillai et al., 1998) where bandwidths are described with linear constraints. The difference is that our model is analytical and nonlinear, and it is easier to handle by our solution algorithm. The maximum bandwidth in the upstreet direction is given by: (17) b u = min k = 1 , \u2026 , N t vk ue + x N - x k v c - max k = 1 , \u2026 , N t vk ub + x N - x k v c In Eq. (17) t vk ue + x N - x k v c and t vk ub + x N - x k v c are the arriving time at Crosswalk N of vehicles departing from Crosswalk k at the end and start of the vehicle green interval at Crosswalk k. It says that the upper bound of bu is no later than the earliest time of arriving at crosswalk N for vehicles from other crosswalks, and the lower bound is no earlier than the latest time. Thus vehicles in platoons can keep progressing during bu . Similarly the maximum bandwidth in the downstreet direction is: (18) b d = min k = 1 , \u2026 , N t vk de + x k v c - max k = 1 , \u2026 , N t vk db + x k v c 3.3 Integrated optimization model The purpose of this integrated model is to optimize the quantity, locations and signal settings of crosswalks with two conflicting objectives. One is minimizing pedestrian detour distance and delay at crosswalks. The other is maximizing the available bandwidths of both directions. More crosswalks contribute to less detour distance while bandwidths are probably affected. A longer pedestrian green interval leads to less delay while a longer vehicle green interval benefits bandwidths. In addition the quantity and signals of crosswalks are closely related to crosswalk locations, which ensures the necessity of optimizing these variables simultaneously. Objectives: For simplicity, objective 1 is transformed into time cost of pedestrians: (19) Min D \u203e v p + d \u00af Objective 2 is derived as the weighted sum of maximum bandwidths in the two directions: (20) Max \u03b1 \u00d7 b u + \u03b2 \u00d7 b d In Eqs. (19) and (20), d \u00af , D \u203e , bu and bd are calculated by sub-models above. \u03b1 and \u03b2 are weight factors which can be determined by relative volumes in the two directions. Constraints: In order to avoid resource waste, the distance interval between two crosswalks is supposed to be no shorter than Smin . It should be noticed that the constraint of maximum servicing radius (Feng et al., 2009a) is eliminated under the condition of discrete demand distribution. Hence the number of crosswalks is bounded as: (21) 2 \u2264 N \u2264 \u230a L / S min \u230b + 1 where \u230a L / S min \u230b is the biggest integer no more than L/Smin . As crosswalks at Intersections I and II are always available, N has a minimum value of 2. For clarification, x 1 and xN are set to 0 and the road segment length L. Locations of crosswalks satisfy: (22) 0 \u2264 x k \u2264 L k = 1 , \u2026 , N (23) x 1 = 0 (24) x N = L (25) x k + 1 - x k \u2a7e S min ( k = 1 , \u2026 , N - 1 ) Bandwidths in upstreet and downstreet directions should have a lower bound so that cars can go through as a fleet: (26) b u \u2a7e b min (27) b d \u2a7e b min It is assumed that the signal settings of Crosswalk 1 (of Intersection I) and Crosswalk N (of Intersection II) are determined in advance. Starts of the vehicle green intervals in the two directions are related as follows: (28) t v 1 ub - t v 1 db = \u0394 1 (29) t vN ub - t vN db = \u0394 2 + nC with n = 0 , 1 , 2 , \u2026 For clarification, the time reference point is set: (30) t vN de = C The vehicle green intervals at Crosswalk 1 and N are fixed, and the ends and starts in both directions satisfy: (31) t v 1 ue - t v 1 ub = g 1 u (32) t vN ue - t vN ub = g 2 u (33) t v 1 de - t v 1 db = g 1 d (34) t vN de - t vN db = g 2 d The end and start of the vehicle green interval at each mid-block crosswalk in each direction are set in the same cycle. To ensure the capacity a minimum green time is also guaranteed: (35) g vmin \u2a7d t vk ue - t vk ub < C k = 2 , \u2026 , N - 1 , N \u2a7e 3 (36) g vmin \u2a7d t vk de - t vk db < C k = 2 , \u2026 , N - 1 , N \u2a7e 3 Pedestrian Walk intervals at upstreet and downstreet curbsides are no less than a minimum green interval: (37) t pk ue - t pk ub \u2a7e g pmin k = 1 , \u2026 , N (38) t pk de - t pk db \u2a7e g pmin k = 1 , \u2026 , N For safety the pedestrian Walk and Flashing Don\u2019t Walk intervals are supposed to fall into the red interval of vehicles: (39) t pk ub + C \u2a7e t vk ue k = 1 , N (40) t pk ue + y \u2a7d t vk ub k = 1 , N (41) t pk db + C \u2a7e t vk de k = 1 , N (42) t pk de + y \u2a7d t vk db k = 1 , N (43) t pk ub + C = t vk ue k = 2 , \u2026 , N - 1 , N \u2a7e 3 (44) t pk ue + y = t vk ub k = 2 , \u2026 , N - 1 , N \u2a7e 3 (45) t pk db + C = t vk de k = 2 , \u2026 , N - 1 , N \u2a7e 3 (46) t pk de + y = t vk db k = 2 , \u2026 , N - 1 , N \u2a7e 3 If one-stage, instead of two-stage, crossing design is applied, additional constraints are added: (47) t pk ub = t pk db + n k C k = 1 , \u2026 , N (48) t pk ue = t pk de + n k C k = 1 , \u2026 , N with n k = 0 , 1 , 2 , \u2026 4 Solution algorithm The proposed optimization model includes competing objectives. Pareto frontiers, the set of Pareto solutions for a multi-objective optimization problem, are preferred. In general two categories of methods are available to generate a Pareto frontier, namely classical methods and evolutionary methods (Erfani and Utyuzhnikov, 2010). However, the objectives in this paper consist of complex non-linear formulations (e.g. the bandwidth expressions). It is difficult to apply classical methods. In addition the efficiency of classical methods is N unsatisfactory especially for large-scale problems. Therefore, evolutionary methods are explored, among which the widely used Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) (Deb et al., 2002) is preferred in this paper. And it has been proved efficient at solving multi-objective signal timing problems (Sun et al., 2003). Eq. (21) says the number of crosswalks N is bounded, with quite limited possible values in reality. In order to simplify the structure of the problem, every possible value of N is enumerated to eliminate the decision variable. Sub-models with given values of are solved separately. Chromosomes are integer-coded. To generate feasible solutions efficiently the coding procedure is developed. And decision variables in obtained feasible solutions are rounded to integer values. Step 1: besides x 1 =0 and xN = L, mid-block crosswalk locations is generated randomly satisfying the constraint of the minimum distance interval between crosswalks (when N >2): (49) x k - 1 + S min \u2a7d x k \u2a7d L - ( N - k ) \u2217 S min k = 2 , \u2026 , N - 1 Step 2: generate signal settings of crosswalks for vehicle flow in downstreet direction. Signal settings at crosswalk N are set fixed as the reference point: (50) t vk db = C - g 2 d k = N (51) t vk de = C k = N Signal settings at mid-block crosswalks are generated randomly satisfying (when N >2): (52) l k - ( C - b min - g pmin - y ) \u2a7d t vk db \u2a7d r k - b min k = N - 1 , \u2026 , 2 (53) max t vk db + g vmin , l k + b min \u2a7d t vk de \u2a7d t vk db + ( C - g pmin - y ) k = N - 1 , \u2026 , 2 with l k = max l = N , \u2026 , k + 1 t vl db + x l - x k v c k = N - 1 , \u2026 , 2 r k = min l = N , \u2026 , k + 1 t vl de + x l - x k v c k = N - 1 , \u2026 , 2 Eqs. (52) and (53) are supposed to guarantee the minimum pedestrian Walk interval, minimum vehicle green interval and minimum bandwidth. Finally signal settings at Crosswalk 1 are generated similarly: (54) l k - ( g 1 d - b min ) \u2a7d t vk db \u2a7d r k - b min k = 1 (55) t vk de = t vk db + g 1 d k = 1 with l k = max l = N , \u2026 , k + 1 t vl db + x l - x k v c k = 1 r k = min l = N , \u2026 , k + 1 t vl de + x l - x k v c k = 1 Step 3: generate signal settings at crosswalks for vehicle flow in upstreet direction in a similar way. Signal settings at Crosswalk 1 in upstreet and downstreet directions are related: (56) t vk ub = t vk db + \u0394 1 k = 1 (57) t vk ue = t vk ub + g 1 u k = 1 Signal settings at mid-block crosswalks are divided into two cases (when N >2). If two-stage crossing design is applied, t vk ub and t vk ue are generated randomly satisfying Eqs. (58) and (59), the same as Eqs. (52) and (53): (58) l k - ( C - b min - g pmin - y ) \u2a7d t vk ub \u2a7d r k - b min k = 2 , \u2026 , N - 1 (59) max t vk ub + g vmin , l k + b min \u2a7d t vk ue \u2a7d t vk ub + ( C - g pmin - y ) k = 2 , \u2026 , N - 1 with l k = max l = 1 , \u2026 , k - 1 t vl ub + x k - x l v c k = 2 , \u2026 , N - 1 r k = min l = 1 , \u2026 , k - 1 t vl ue + x k - x l v c k = 2 , \u2026 , N - 1 If one-stage crossing design is applied, t vk ub and t vk ue are related to t vk db and t vk de respectively: (60) t vk ub = t vk db + n k C \u2026 k = 2 , \u2026 , N - 1 (61) t vk ue = t vk de + n k C k = 2 , \u2026 , N - 1 where the integer nk makes Eqs. (58) and (59) satisfied. Note that if no nk exists, restart the procedure. Finally signal settings at crosswalk N are given by an integer satisfying Eq. (62): (62) \u2308 l k - ( g 2 u - b min ) - ( t vk db + \u0394 2 ) C \u2309 \u2a7d n k \u2a7d \u230a r k - b min - ( t vk db + \u0394 2 ) C \u230b \u2026 k = N (63) t vk ub = t vk db + \u0394 2 + n k C k = N (64) t vk ue = t vk ub + g 2 u k = N with l k = max l = 1 , \u2026 , k - 1 t vl ub + x k - x l v c k = N r k = min l = 1 , \u2026 , k - 1 t vl ue + x k - x l v c k = N Note that the procedure is restarted if no available nk exists. Step 4: generate signal settings at crosswalks for pedestrians. Signal settings for pedestrians at mid-block crosswalks are determined by vehicular signals (when N >2): (65) t pk db = t vk de - C k = 2 , \u2026 , N - 1 (66) t pk de = t vk db - y k = 2 , \u2026 , N - 1 (67) t pk ub = t vk ue - C k = 2 \u2026 N - 1 (68) t pk ue = t vk ub - y k = 2 \u2026 , N - 1 Eqs. (65)\u2013(68) guarantee that the start of Pedestrian Walk interval and the end of FDW are the end and start of vehicle green interval respectively. Pedestrian signals at crosswalks at intersections are divided into two cases: If two-stage crossing design is applied: (69) t pk db = t vk de - C k = 1 , N (70) t pk de = t vk db - y k = 1 , N (71) t pk ub = t vk ue - C k = 1 , N (72) t pk ue = t vk ub - y k = 1 , N These equations are the same as Eqs. (65)\u2013(68). If one-stage crossing design is applied: (73) t pk db = t pk ub = max t vk de - C , t vk ue - C k = 1 (74) t pk de = t pk ue = min t vk db - y , t vk ub - y k = 1 (75) t pk ub = max t vk ue - C , t vk de - C + n k C k = N (76) t pk ue = min t vk ub - y , t vk db - y + n k C k = N (77) t pk db = t pk ub - n k C k = N (78) t pk de = t pk ue - n k C k = N where the integer nk satisfies: (79) t vk ue - C + ( g pmin + y ) - t vk db C \u2a7d n k \u2a7d t vk ub - ( g pmin + y ) - ( t vk de - C ) C k = N Eqs. (73) and (74) guarantee the simultaneousness of signal settings in the upstreet and downstreet directions at Crosswalk 1 as well as the constraints between pedestrian and vehicular signals. And Eqs. (75)\u2013(78) guarantee those at Crosswalk N. 5 Numerical example 5.1 Experiment design To illustrate the applicability of the proposed models, a simplified road segment model derived from Zhoujiazui Road of Shanghai is applied for experimental tests. Totally there are 8 lanes in two directions. The discrete distribution of pedestrian crossing demands is shown in Fig. 4 . Points 1\u20134 at four corners are where pedestrians get into or out of the segment. Points 5 and 6 are both bus stops. Points 7 and 9 are communities. Point 8 is a hotel club. The parameters used in the case study are summarized in Table 2 . The distance interval between crosswalks should be no less than 150m for vehicular benefits (BTMB and BMAQTS, 2007). Pedestrian speed is 1.2m/s (Yang, 2010). The minimum pedestrian Walk interval is set to 4s (Ma et al., 2014). Due to lack of field data of signal settings at the intersections and pedestrian crossing demands, other inputs are assumed reasonably as shown in Tables 2 and 3 . Note that the demands in Table 3 are relative values with respect to F 13. In the following study, possible crosswalk numbers are enumerated. The integrated \u03b8 optimization model is solved and a Pareto frontier is derived for each number value. On the basis of the Pareto frontiers an optimal solution is selected for illustration. And the optimization results are further discussed then. To explore the impacts of several concerned parameters a sensitivity analysis is conducted finally. 5.2 Optimization model settings Critical parameters in the models and solving algorithm are given below. Critical parameters such as the crossover and mutation probability, the population size, and the maximum number of generations, were chosen conservatively after 50 experiments to ensure the optimum of solutions at the cost of efficiency. However, parameter selection methods such the automatic adaptation procedure can be further investigated to improve the efficiency. \u2022 The possible number of crosswalks N is 2, 3, 4 and 5 according to Eq. (21). \u2022 Weight factors of bandwidths in upstreet and downstreet directions \u03b1 and \u03b2 are both 1. \u2022 Minimum green interval for vehicles at a crosswalk gvmin is 55s. \u2022 Pedestrian distance sensitivity \u03b8 is 3m. \u2022 The crossover and mutation probability are 0.8 and 0.2 respectively. \u2022 The population size is 2000. \u2022 800 is set as the maximum number of generations to guarantee the optimal solutions. Because the algorithm has reached a satisfactory Pareto frontier after 600 generations when N is 5 shown in Fig. 5 . \u2022 And the solution process is finished in about 30min (Computer specification: CPU Intel Core i5-4200H @2.8GHz; RAM: 4.00GB). 5.3 Results and discussions Fig. 6 shows the Pareto frontiers when the available crosswalk number is 2, 3, 4 and 5. The frontier is only a point when N =2. It is far above the other 3 frontiers. Obviously available mid-block crosswalks contribute to significant reduction in pedestrian cost. Furthermore, the frontier of N =4 lies below those of N =3 and 5. The result demonstrates that the optimal number of crosswalks is 4 (i.e. 2 mid-block crosswalks). It is also noticed that there is an interesting point in the frontier of N =4. After the maximum bandwidth reaches 70s, the average time cost of pedestrians increases at a higher rate as the bandwidth grows. Hence this point is preferred to illustrate the optimization results. The solutions corresponding to the point are portrayed as an example. In this case study a unique optimal solution is derived. The optimized crosswalk locations and corresponding signal settings for vehicles are illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8 , respectively. Table 4 further summarizes the optimized maximum bandwidths, demand weighted signal delay and detour distance. The optimized bandwidths in upstreet and downstreet directions are unequal due to the unbalanced crossing demands on both segment sides. Detour distance is optimized to a quite low level, as expected. It is noticed that the frontier of N =5 lies above that of N =4 in Fig. 6. The results are contrary to the intuition that more available mid-block crosswalks degrade operations of vehicles and pedestrians. Table 4 shows the optimal solution corresponding to the point with the bandwidth of 70s in the frontier of N =5 for unbiased comparisons. From Table 4 it is observed that the counterintuitive phenomenon is due to the increase in both detour distance and signal delay. Especially the total detour distance has a significant increase when the number of crosswalk increased to 5. The reason is that the locations of optimized crosswalks are more away from origins or destinations as more crosswalks are added due to the constraint of minimum distance interval (25), as shown in Figs. 7 and 9 . Fig. 10 further depicts the average delay of crossing pedestrians from upstreet and downstreet curbsides. Signal delay at crosswalks except Crosswalk 3 when N =5 is similar with that at the four crosswalks when N =4. But the pedestrian delay at Crosswalk 3 in Fig. 9 is quite conspicuous, which results in larger average delay. Above results show that excess crosswalks are likely to conduct no improvement in crossing cost of pedestrians but to degrade pedestrian operations probably. There are two main reasons: (a) There is a constraint of minimum interval between crosswalks (150m). This constraint is reasonable because it can reduce the disturbance to vehicles. However, it will result in the deviation of crosswalks from optimal locations (without this constraint), hence induce higher pedestrian travel time. (b) The increased crosswalk number makes signal coordination more difficult and affects vehicles a lot. Indeed, it is highly necessary to taking vehicular cost into consideration when optimizing crosswalks for an artery. To explore the effectiveness of the optimization model in this paper, the Pareto frontier of 3 crosswalks case in Fig. 6, for simplicity of illustration, is further investigated in Fig. 11 . Time cost of pedestrians consists of detour time related to crosswalk locations and delay related to crosswalk signal settings. Fig. 11 illustrates that pedestrian detour distance is minimized to a great extent in the whole frontier. It has the potential to prevent jaywalking significantly (Sisiopiku and Akin, 2003). Meanwhile optimized average signal delay is no more than 30s, which will improve the rate of pedestrian compliance (Jian et al., 2010). It is of interest to notice that the optimal locations of the mid-block crosswalk on the frontier differ little. It suggests that optimized locations of mid-block crosswalks are mainly impacted by the demand distribution. Although the crosswalk location keeps invariable (299m) the delay and bandwidth both vary due to different optimal signal settings. Thus it is suggested that locations and signal settings of crosswalks be optimized simultaneously. 5.4 Sensitivity analysis Pedestrian phase pattern, minimum vehicle green interval and pedestrian distance sensitivity are thought to be important factors and sensitivity analysis of these parameters are conducted. However, the results show that pedestrian distance sensitivity produces little impact. Hence only the former two factors are further investigated in the following. 5.4.1 Pedestrian phase pattern If the road width is halved one-stage crossing design can be applied with the parameters unchanged. The optimization results are shown in Fig. 12 . It demonstrates that the optimal number of crosswalks in the numerical example is 4, the same as that in Fig. 6 with two-stage crossing design. It is inferred that the optimal crosswalk number is mainly determined by the discrete demand distribution, rather than the pedestrian phase pattern. Compared with two-stage crossing design, however, the optimization results are much worse when only one mid-block crosswalk is added. Limited bandwidths are available and pedestrian crossing cost increases at a high rate. It shows that unbearable consequence may be suffered due to the lack of available crosswalks in the case of one-stage crossing design. 5.4.2 Minimum vehicle green interval Pareto frontiers of four two-stage crosswalks with constraints of different minimum vehicle green intervals are displayed in Fig. 13 . It indicates that a smaller minimum interval leads to more satisfactory operations of pedestrians and vehicles, for a frontier with a smaller value lies lower. Intuitively, that is because smaller green intervals of vehicles contribute to more available pedestrian Walk intervals and fewer limits in signal optimization. Minimum green intervals in different ranges lead to different impacts on the operations of vehicles and pedestrians. The vehicle green intervals at crosswalks of the two intersections are 50s. When the minimum interval is raised from 50s to 65s, the minimum bandwidth increases from 40s to 69s dramatically. The signal optimization is limited to a large extent. However, the service level of pedestrians is improved more conspicuously as the minimum interval decreases from 50s. 6 Conclusion In this study, an integrated optimization model of mid-block crosswalks along an arterial segment is proposed to achieve an optimal tradeoff between pedestrian cost including detour distance and delay at signalized crosswalks and vehicular cost measured by maximum bandwidths. The optimal quantity, locations and signal settings of crosswalks are optimized simultaneously. NSGA II based algorithm is designed and employed to obtain the Pareto frontier efficiently. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model is validated by a numerical example and extensive sensitivity analysis. The results showed that: (1) much improvements can be reached by optimizing the quantity, locations and signal settings of crosswalks simultaneously in terms of pedestrian detour, pedestrian signal delay, and vehicular bandwidths; (2) adding more crosswalks may not contribute much additional improvement in pedestrian crossing cost when the constraint of the minimum interval between crosswalks and vehicular cost are taken into account; and (3) two-stage crosswalks are more favorable than one-stage ones for both pedestrian and vehicles. Note that the proposed model in this paper is developed on the basis of discrete demand distribution. However, there is a case that pedestrians who simply walking along a commercial street may not have a specific destination, which differ from discrete demands. Methods that can address both demand types (discrete and continuous) simultaneously remain to be further investigated. Taking randomness of pedestrian crossing demands into consideration, stochastic models are worth more attention in the future. More factors which have impacts on crossing route choice behavior are worth investigating in detail, and the proposed route choice model can be extended to a dynamic one as proposed by Papadimitriou (2012) to address more considerations. Other models of pedestrian delay and maximum vehicular bandwidths can also be extended such as considering a varying arriving rate of pedestrians and a range of vehicle velocity. What is more, pedestrian behaviors of jaywalking and disobeying traffic signals are also interesting extensions.
