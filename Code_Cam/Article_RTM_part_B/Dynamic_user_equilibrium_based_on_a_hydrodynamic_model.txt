"Transportation Research Part B: MethodologicalDynamic user equilibrium based on a hydrodynamic modelAbstract In this paper we present a continuous-time network loading procedure based on the Lighthill\u2013Whitham\u2013Richards model proposed by Lighthill and Whitham (1955) and Richards (1956). A system of differential algebraic equations (DAEs) is proposed for describing traffic flow propagation, travel delay and route choices. We employ a novel numerical apparatus to reformulate the scalar conservation law as a flow-based partial differential equation (PDE), which is then solved semi-analytically with the Lax\u2013Hopf formula. This approach allows for an efficient computational scheme for large-scale networks. We embed this network loading procedure into the dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) model proposed by Friesz et al. (1993). The DUE model is solved as a differential variational inequality (DVI) using a fixed-point algorithm. Several numerical examples of DUE on networks of varying sizes are presented, including the Sioux Falls network with a significant number of paths and origin\u2013destination pairs (OD). The DUE model presented in this article can be formulated as a variational inequality (VI) as reported in Friesz et al. (1993). We will present the Kuhn\u2013Tucker (KT) conditions for that VI, which is a linear system for any given feasible solution, and use them to check whether a DUE solution has been attained. In order to solve for the KT multiplier we present a decomposition of the linear system that allows efficient computation of the dual variables. The numerical solutions of DUE obtained from fixed-point iterations will be tested against the KT conditions and validated as legitimate solutions.serial JL 271728 291210 291772 291817 31 Transportation Research Part B: Methodological TRANSPORTATIONRESEARCHPARTBMETHODOLOGICAL 2012-11-19 2012-11-19 2013-01-11T15:41:30 1-s2.0-S019126151200135X S0191-2615(12)00135-X S019126151200135X 10.1016/j.trb.2012.10.001 S300 S300.1 FULL-TEXT 1-s2.0-S0191261512X00109 2015-05-14T05:39:52.915433-04:00 0 0 20130101 20130131 2013 2012-11-19T00:00:00Z articleinfo crossmark dco dateupdated tomb dateloaded datesearch indexeddate volumelist yearnav articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright dateloadedtxt docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdateend pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sectiontitle sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype subheadings suppl volfirst volissue webpdf webpdfpagecount figure table body mmlmath affil articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authkeywords authlast footnotes primabst ref specialabst alllist content subj ssids 0191-2615 01912615 false 47 47 C Volume 47 9 102 126 102 126 201301 January 2013 2013-01-01 2013-01-31 2013 Research papers article fla Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Highlights \u25ba The LWR model is reformulated as a flow-based PDE under certain condition. \u25ba A semi-analytical solution to the link loading problem is presented and justified. \u25ba The network loading problem is formulated as a DAE system. \u25ba The DAE system is embedded into the DUE and tested in a large-scale problem. \u25ba The numerical solutions of DUE are tested against the KT conditions for VI. Abstract In this paper we present a continuous-time network loading procedure based on the Lighthill\u2013Whitham\u2013Richards model proposed by Lighthill and Whitham (1955) and Richards (1956). A system of differential algebraic equations (DAEs) is proposed for describing traffic flow propagation, travel delay and route choices. We employ a novel numerical apparatus to reformulate the scalar conservation law as a flow-based partial differential equation (PDE), which is then solved semi-analytically with the Lax\u2013Hopf formula. This approach allows for an efficient computational scheme for large-scale networks. We embed this network loading procedure into the dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) model proposed by Friesz et al. (1993). The DUE model is solved as a differential variational inequality (DVI) using a fixed-point algorithm. Several numerical examples of DUE on networks of varying sizes are presented, including the Sioux Falls network with a significant number of paths and origin\u2013destination pairs (OD). The DUE model presented in this article can be formulated as a variational inequality (VI) as reported in Friesz et al. (1993). We will present the Kuhn\u2013Tucker (KT) conditions for that VI, which is a linear system for any given feasible solution, and use them to check whether a DUE solution has been attained. In order to solve for the KT multiplier we present a decomposition of the linear system that allows efficient computation of the dual variables. The numerical solutions of DUE obtained from fixed-point iterations will be tested against the KT conditions and validated as legitimate solutions. Keywords LWR model Dynamic user equilibrium Dynamic network loading Lax\u2013Hopf formula 1 Introduction Dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models determine departure rates, departure times and route choices over a given planning horizon. They seek to describe the dynamic evolution of traffic in networks in a fashion consistent with the fundamental notions of traffic flow and travel demand. This paper is concerned with a specific type of dynamic traffic assignment known as dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) for which generalized travel cost is identical for route and departure time choices associated with any given origin\u2013destination (OD) pair. 1.1 Dynamic user equilibrium (DUE): a brief review DUE is the primary form of DTA that this paper will focus on. The last two decades have seen many efforts to develop a theoretically sound formulation of dynamic network user equilibrium that is also in a canonical form acceptable to scholars and practitioners alike. DUE models tend to be comprised of four essential subproblems: 1. a model of path delay; 2. flow dynamics; 3. flow propagation constraints; and 4. a route and departure-time choice model. Furthermore, there are two major components of item 4 above: (a) the mathematical expression of Nash-like equilibrium conditions and (b) a network performance model which is an embedded dynamic network loading (DNL) problem. In the DNL procedure arc-specific volumes, arc-specific exit rates and experienced path delay are determined when departure rates are known for each path, see Friesz et al. (2011). It is the embedded dynamic network loading (DNL) problem that makes DUE so difficult. An unfortunate and yet popular misconception is that devising a separate algorithm for the DNL problem means one has chosen a sequential approach to DUE, whereby one first solves the DNL problem then solves the DUE problem, without requiring or attaining consistency. Such a perspective is not even remotely correct. Instead, the DNL process should be understood as the embodiment of the state operator introduced in Friesz et al. (2011) and Friesz (2010) and not as some sort of approximation. 1 Note that, by referring to the network loading procedure, we are neither employing nor suggesting a sequential approach to the study and computation of DUE. Rather a subset of the equations and inequalities comprising a complete DUE model may be grouped in a way that identifies a traffic assignment subproblem and a network loading subproblem. Such a grouping and choice of names is merely a matter of convenient language that avoids repetitive reference to the same mathematical expressions. Use of such language does not alter the need to solve both the assignment and loading problems consistently and, thus, simultaneously. A careful reading of the mathematical presentation made in subsequent sections makes this assertion quite clear. 1 Some early analytical DUE models were greatly influenced by the dynamic system optimal models presented in Merchant and Nemhauser (1978a,b) as well as by a desire to find an equivalent optimization problem. In Friesz et al. (1989), and later in Ran et al. (1993), a Beckmann-type objective function is employed to create an optimal control problem whose solutions are of the DUE type. Friesz et al. (1993) showed a variational inequality may be used to represent dynamic user equilibrium when there are both route and departure time decisions. Following suit, Ran and Boyce (1996) suggested other variational inequality (VI) formulations of DUE with somewhat unusual flow propagation constraints that are meant to avoid the imposition of state constraints while also assuring physically realistic flows; unfortunately their constraints do not reflect the contraction and expansion of vehicle platoons and are intrinsically inconsistent with other aspects of their model as pointed out by Friesz et al. (2011). In contrast, Friesz et al. (2011) utilized flow propagation constraints that involved both state and control variables as well as state-dependent time shifts to account for expansion and contraction of platoons while also maintaining model consistency. A dual-time-scale formulation of DUE with demand evolution was also presented in Friesz et al. (2011) where a differential variational inequality (DVI) formulation was used to model dynamic user equilibrium. The authors implemented a fixed-point algorithm to solve the DVI. The DNL phase of DUE is expressed in Friesz et al. (2011) as a system of differential algebraic equations (DAEs) and approximated as a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Moreover, Friesz et al. (2011) also showed the compatibility of the proposed DUE formulation with the CTM proposed in Daganzo (1994, 1995). The papers, Wu et al. (1998) and Xu et al. (1999) developed algorithms for the model introduced in Friesz et al. (1993) based upon the gradient projection method without any proof of convergence. The CTM was employed by Lo and Szeto (2002) to create link dynamics as well as a path travel time extraction procedure. Their procedure allows the CTM to subsume the role of the effective path delay operator as originally articulated by Friesz et al. (1993). Zhu and Marcotte (2000) showed that when departure rates have uniform upper bounds, a solution exists for the continuous-time user equilibrium with route choices. Recently in Han et al. (2012a), the existence of a simultaneous route-and-departure choice DUE has been established without assuming a priori bounds on the path flows. In that paper, the authors used the generalized Vickrey model developed in Han et al. (in press-a, in press-b) for the embedded DNL sub-problem. 1.2 Dynamic traffic flow models An essential component of many DTA models is the DNL procedure, which determines traffic states from the link dynamics. The accurate and efficient computation of the DNL sub-problem is crucial to the overall performance of the DTA model. The primary purpose of the DNL procedure within the DUE model is to numerically evaluate the so-called effective delay operator introduced by Friesz et al. (1993), which is not available in closed-form. The DNL procedure determines path-specific travel times given a set of known routing and departure time choices. The outcome of the DNL sub-problem relies heavily on the type of link model and junction model chosen. In this section, we will review a few macroscopic traffic flow models most commonly used in the current literature, leading up to the Lighthill\u2013Whitham\u2013Richards (LWR) model of Lighthill and Whitham (1955) and Richards (1956) that we will consider in this paper. 1.2.1 Macroscopic link models We start our discussion with single link loading. Depending on the ways of specifying flow propagation, we distinguish between delay-function models and the exit-flow function models. The former is described and solved based on an explicit travel delay function given exogenous parameters that are typically estimated by fitting functions to real-world data. One example is the link delay model (LDM); see Friesz et al. (1993), Wu et al. (1998) and Xu et al. (1999). In contrast, exit-flow function models are based on explicitly modeling the underlying flow dynamics as demonstrated by the M\u2013N model of Merchant and Nemhauser (1978a,b), the cell transmission model (CTM) of Daganzo (1994, 1995) and Vickrey\u2019s model (VM) of Vickrey (1969). Among the link models mentioned above, the CTM is the most widely used model in the realm of DNL primarily because: (1) it is based on simple rules for the propagation of traffic states over discrete cells; (2) it is easy to extend to a network; and (3) it captures several key phenomena of real-world traffic such as shock waves and spillback. It has been shown in Daganzo (1994) that the CTM is the discrete version of LWR model on a single arc, given a trapezoidal density\u2013flow relationship. One limitation of the CTM lies in the computational inefficiency as the algorithm stores and updates traffic quantities in a two-dimensional cell. In Nie and Zhang (2008), where a comparative study of various link models was conducted, the CTM was shown to be computationally demanding in terms of solution time and memory consumption. 1.2.2 LWR network model The LWR model is another macroscopic link model that describes traffic dynamics in terms of the formation, propagation and interaction of kinematic waves. It has received increased attention in the field of traffic flow theory in the past several decades due to its capability of capturing key features of vehicular traffic such as shock waves and spillback. The primary mathematical form of LWR model is a partial differential equation (PDE) describing the temporal\u2013spatial evolution of average density and flow. The PDE of interest here is based on conservation of vehicles and an explicit density\u2013flow relation known as the fundamental diagram (1.1) \u2202 \u2202 t \u03c1 ( t , x ) + \u2202 \u2202 x f ( \u03c1 ( t , x ) ) = 0 where \u03c1(t, x) denotes the local vehicle density and f(\u03c1(t, x)) is the flow. The fundamental diagram f(\u00b7) is a continuous and concave function defined on [0, \u03c1 jam ] where \u03c1 jam is the jam density. The fundamental diagram encodes the speed-density relation and is calibrated using empirical data. Classical mathematical results on first-order PDEs of the form (1.1) can be found in Bressan (2000). For a detailed discussion of numerical schemes for conservation laws, we refer the reader to Godunov (1959) and LeVeque (1992). The extension of LWR model to networks has been studied extensively in the literature: a list of selected references include Coclite et al. (2005), Daganzo (1994, 1995), Garavello and Piccoli (2006), Holden and Risebro (1995), Jin (2010), Jin and Zhang (2003) Lebacque (1996) and Lebacque and Khoshyaran (1999). A detailed survey can also be found in Zhang (2001). The primary difficulty with the LWR-based network loading problem stems from the complex boundary conditions at a junction of arbitrary topology. Holden and Risebro (1995) were among the first to propose an analytical framework to derive the weak entropy solution of conservation laws at the junction. In particular, they extended the notion of weak solution to a single conservation law to several conservation laws with coupling boundary conditions. In order to isolate a unique solution at the junction, an entropy condition was introduced which amounts to optimizing some abstract objective function. In Coclite et al. (2005), the notion of entropy condition was instantiated by maximizing the flux through the junction over all possible boundary fluxes of links incident to the junction. They solved the Riemann problems at junctions with fixed vehicle turning percentages. However, these conditions are insufficient to isolate a unique solution in the case where the number of incoming links exceeds that of outgoing links. To overcome this difficulty, the authors introduced a right-of-way parameter specifying the priority of incoming vehicles. Complex boundary conditions can be relatively easily analyzed using demand\u2013supply functions proposed in Lebacque (1996) and Lebacque and Khoshyaran (1999). In this framework, local traffic demand (sending flow) and supply (receiving flow) are defined as functions of traffic states on the links immediately adjacent to the junction. Depending on the topology of the junction and specific traffic controls and policies, the boundary fluxes through the junction can be expressed in various ways in terms of demand of upstream links and supply of downstream links. The demand\u2013supply functions are often used with CTM. Such a discrete network model is based on simple releasing rules and conforms to physical intuition. Therefore, it is a popular choice for numerically computing traffic flows on networks. There are primarily three classes of numerical schemes for PDE (1.1), given complex boundary conditions including initial, upstream boundary, downstream boundary and even internal boundary conditions. The three classes are: 1. finite difference schemes, e.g. Daganzo (1994), Godunov (1959), LeVeque (1992); 2. wave-front tracking methods, e.g. Bressan (2000), Dafermos (1972, 2010), Garavello and Piccoli (2006), Holden and Risebro (2002); and 3. variational methods, e.g. Aubin et al. (2008), Claudel and Bayen (2010b), Daganzo (2005, 2006), Evans (2010), Lax (1957, 1973), Le Floch (1988). Finite difference schemes mainly require a two-dimensional grid on the temporal\u2013spatial domain. Modelers implementing such type of schemes need to ensure that the Courant\u2013Friedrchs\u2013Lewy condition is satisfied in order to guarantee that solutions are numerically stable; see Courant et al. (1928). Furthermore, the solutions tend to exhibit numerical viscosity in which shock waves or contact discontinuities are misrepresented as smooth variations. Wave-front tracking is an event-based computational method that resolves the discontinuities (shocks) exactly. The method was originally proposed in Dafermos (1972) for the study of existence and uniqueness of solution to the initial value problem. Wave-front tracking method is built within a class of piecewise constant boundary conditions and a piecewise affine flux function. It has also been applied to systems of conservation laws as well as traffic network models; as an example see Coclite et al. (2005) and Holden and Risebro (1995). The variational method was initially developed in Lax (1957, 1973) (Lax\u2013Oleinik formula) for the scalar conservation laws, using the method of characteristics. This method was also developed for a Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation using the calculus of variations (Lax\u2013Hopf formula). The Lax-type formula expresses the weak entropy solution (viscosity solution) to the conservation laws (H\u2013J equations) semi-analytically as the solution of a minimization problem. Generalizations of this method are made in Aubin et al. (2008), Daganzo (2005, 2006) and Le Floch (1988). The application of this method to fluid-based models such as traffic flows was recently investigated in Bressan and Han (2011a,b), Claudel and Bayen (2010a) and Han et al. (2012c). In contrast to finite difference schemes, the variational method has the distinct advantage of not requiring a two-dimensional grid in the sense that the solution at one point in space\u2013time does not require intermediate computation at other points in the domain. Variational methods also yield solutions with arguably better precision than finite difference schemes. For example, discontinuities in the solution are more accurately obtained by the variational method; see Claudel and Bayen (2010a) and LeVeque (1992). 1.2.3 An LWR-based network loading procedure This paper presents a new dynamic network loading procedure employing the LWR-PDE (1.1). The procedure is fundamentally based upon the Lax\u2013Hopf formula to solve the PDE. In particular, we will introduce a flow-based conservation law instead of density-based conservation law (1.1 ). This enables us to transform a boundary value problem into an initial value problem. Such a formulation allows us to apply the Lax\u2013Hopf formula directly and obtain a closed-form solution for a single link. We will extend the framework to a general network when the vehicle paths and departure rates are given. In order to find the network delay we will invoke an approach similar to that shown by Newell (1993). That is, the implicit travel time defined via the horizontal difference between cumulative vehicle counts. The novelty of our network loading procedure is the utilization of a flow-based conservation law and a grid-free computational method. These techniques allow the upstream boundary value problems for a single link to be solved efficiency and accurately. Furthermore, we will shown in Section 2.2 that our approach will work for very general flow profiles in which the cumulative vehicle count may not be Lipschitz continuous or not continuous at all. In these cases, the flows can be unbounded and even distributions. Our procedure has the ability to capture the following several key network traffic phenomena: 1. Queues and delay; 2. Density\u2013velocity relationship; 3. First-in-first-out (FIFO); 4. Route information. The analytical solution to the PDE allows us to represent the network loading procedure as a system of differential algebraic equations (DAEs) instead of partial differential algebraic equations (PDAEs). Our method also has the key distinction of not relying upon the use of a spatial grid for numerical computation. Therefore, large-scale dynamic traffic assignment network problems can be solved with sufficient accuracy and computational efficiency. Contributions of our work include: 1. Derivation of an explicit formula for a single link loading procedure based on the LWR model with boundary value conditions. To do this, we propose a flow-based scalar conservation law and transform a boundary value problem into an initial value problem. We then apply the Lax\u2013Hopf formula. The resulting explicit formula is proved to hold for very general inflow profiles such as unboundedness and distributions. 2. Formulation of a DAE system for network loading, based on the model mentioned in the immediately above bullet number one. In particular, the DAE system encodes merging and diverging junction models, route information and travel delay. 3. Implementation of the devised DNL procedure within the context of DUE while demonstrating the ability of the DAE system to handle very complex network topology and routing information. We demonstrate the computational efficiency of our proposed procedure through a numerical example of the Sioux Falls network with significant number of origin\u2013destination pairs and paths. The numerical performance will be compared with other DNL procedures such as CTM and link delay model. 4. Articulation of the Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions for the variational inequality formulation of DUE proposed in Friesz et al. (2011). Our numerical solutions of DUE will be verified against the KT necessary conditions. This is the first reported effort to validate DUE solutions using KT conditions. 1.3 Organization The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss in detail the single link loading problem using the Lax\u2013Hopf formula. We then then extend the framework to a general network, with a discussion of merging and diverging flow, as well as formation and dissipation of traffic queues. Furthermore, a DAE system formulation of the network loading procedure will be presented at the end of Section 2. In Section 3, we will briefly review various formulations of the simultaneous route-and-departure choice DUE. For completeness of our presentation we have included a fixed-point algorithm for computing the solution a differential variational inequality formulation of DUE. The Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions for a finite-dimensional version of that VI are presented and later used to verify that the DUE solutions we obtain are indeed valid DUE solutions. Section 4 discusses several numerical examples of computing a DUE for networks of varying sizes, including the well-known Sioux Falls network. 2 LWR model and dynamic network loading The aim of this section is to systematically derive the dynamic network loading procedure employing the LWR model within the DUE framework presented in Friesz et al. (2011). We will first introduce the well-known LWR-PDE of Lighthill and Whitham (1955) and Richards (1956) for the dynamics of a single arc, then transform that PDE into a flow-based conservation law under the assumption of no spillback. This novel approach enables us to apply the Lax\u2013Hopf formula and represent the solution of a single arc in closed form. Furthermore, we will discuss how the phenomenon of bottlenecking and queuing can be captured by the Lax\u2013Hopf formula. We discuss an implicit travel time function based on cumulative vehicle counts and extend the single link model to a general network incorporating the different routing and departure time choices. The use of a solution representation independent of spatial variables allows us to remove the PDE constraints from the PDAE system and thus, derive a DAE system in its place. 2.1 Generic network model We first start by introducing the network model and briefly mention the dynamics on each link and interactions of links at junctions. The detailed discussion of network loading procedure will be postponed until Sections 2.2\u20132.6. The notion of a vehicular network is made precise using a directed graph. Definition 2.1 Network definition A traffic network is a directed graph ( A , V ) where each arc e \u2208 A corresponds to a homogeneous road and each vertex v \u2208 V represents the junction. In addition: 1. For each arc e \u2208 A , define the free-flow speed v 0 e , the jam density \u03c1 jam e , the flow capacity M e and the length L e . Each arc is mapped onto a spatial interval [a e , b e ] with b e \u2212 a e = L e ; 2. Each road e \u2208 A possesses a queue with zero physical size (point queue), which is located at the forward node of the road, i.e. at x = a e ; 3. Denote for each v \u2208 V the set of incoming (upstream) arcs by I v the set of outgoing (downstream) arcs by O v . In the case | O v | > 1 , we call node v dispersive and use the allocation rates (turning percentage) A v,e(t) to denote the proportion of total flow coming from e \u02c6 \u2208 I v that goes to the queue of downstream arc e. For each e \u2208 A , let \u03c1 e (t, x) be the vehicle density at time t and location x \u2208[a e , b e ] and q e (t) the queue volume. The well-known LWR model describes the evolution of vehicle density using a scalar conservation law: (2.2) \u2202 t \u03c1 e + \u2202 x ( \u03c1 e v e ( \u03c1 e ) ) = 0 where the dependence on (t, x) is dropped for brevity. The function v e ( \u00b7 ) : 0 , \u03c1 jam e \u2192 0 , v 0 e expresses the vehicle velocity as a function of local density and defines the fundamental diagram f e (\u03c1 e )\u2250 \u03c1 e v e (\u03c1 e ). Throughout this article, we assume the following assumption for the fundamental diagram: A1 The fundamental diagram f e ( \u00b7 ) : 0 , \u03c1 jam e \u2192 [ 0 , M e ] is continuous and concave, with a unique \u03c1 e,\u2217 such that f e (\u03c1 e,\u2217)= M e Now the dynamics of the network can be described by a system of coupling PDEs and ODEs. Thus for i.e. for e \u2208 O v (2.3) \u2202 t \u03c1 e ( t , x ) + \u2202 x f e ( \u03c1 e ( t , x ) ) = 0 , ( t , x ) \u2208 [ t 0 , t f ] \u00d7 [ a e , b e ] \u03c1 e ( 0 , x ) = 0 , x \u2208 [ a e , b e ] (2.4) d dt q e ( t ) = A v , e ( t ) \u2211 e \u02c6 \u2208 I v f e \u02c6 ( \u03c1 e \u02c6 ( t , b e \u02c6 ) ) - f e ( \u03c1 e ( t , a e ) ) (2.5) f e ( \u03c1 e ( t , a e ) ) = min A v , e ( t ) \u2211 e \u02c6 \u2208 I v f e \u02c6 \u03c1 e \u02c6 ( t , b e \u02c6 ) , M e q e ( t ) = 0 M e q e ( t ) > 0 where f e (\u03c1 e (t, a e )) is the service rate, i.e., the rate at which cars in the queue enter the link ahead, and the rule for the service rate is described as follows: if the queue is empty, the service rate will be the portion of the demand allowed by the capacity; if the queue is non-empty, the service rate remains maximum. The above PDAE system describes the flow/density propagation on each road and at junctions, but it is incomplete in the sense that a travel time operator needs to be defined and the turning percentage A v,e(t) needs to be extracted from the routing information. In the following section, we will insert details to this system (2.3)\u2013(2.5) and in fact replace it with a DAE system. 2.2 A flow-based conservation law In consistency with the assumption of dynamic network loading, we assume the network is initially empty. Consider a homogeneous arc e \u2208 A in the network characterized by the free-flow speed v 0, the jam density \u03c1 jam , the flow capacity M and the length L. The superscript e is dropped here for brevity. Denote the right hand side of (2.5) by u \u00af ( t ) , the conservation law (2.3) is in fact a problem with initial and boundary values: (2.6) \u2202 t \u03c1 ( t , x ) + \u2202 x f ( \u03c1 ( t , x ) ) = 0 ( t , x ) \u2208 [ t 0 , t f ] \u00d7 [ a , b ] \u03c1 ( t 0 , x ) = 0 f ( \u03c1 ( t , a ) ) = u \u00af ( t ) In view of the boundary conditions above, and in (2.4) and (2.5), which are all prescribed in terms of flow, it would be convenient to modify the density-based conservation law and derive a new one whose primary variable is the flow. To this end, denote the vehicle flow by u(t, x) and consider the function g(\u00b7) defined by (2.7) \u03d5 ( u ) = inf \u03c1 \u2208 [ 0 , \u03c1 jam ] { f ( \u03c1 ) = u } In other words\u2019 \u03d5(\u00b7) is the inverse of f(\u00b7) on [0, \u03c1 \u2217], where \u03c1 \u2217 is the unique density such that f(\u03c1 \u2217)= M. By Assumption A1, \u03d5(\u00b7) is continuous, convex and strictly increasing, see Fig. 1 . Remark 2.2 By choosing the part of the fundamental diagram with only positive wave speed, we are making the following important modeling assumption: we do not consider backward propagation of traffic densities nor spillback. This assumption can be reflected also in Eqs. (2.3)\u2013(2.5) where the queues (complete jam) will not affect previous arcs. In order to apply the classical Lax\u2013Hopf formula, it is convenient to transform the initial/boundary value problem (2.6) into a Cauchy problem, i.e. an initial value problem. To do so, we will next derive a flow-based conservation law and rigorously show its equivalence to (2.6). Let us introduce the notion of a weak solution and entropy admissible solution. For more details on the theory of hyperbolic PDEs, we refer the reader to Bressan (2000). Definition 2.3 Weak solution for (2.6) Assume u \u00af \u2208 L 1 ( [ t 0 , t f ] ) . A function \u03c1: [t 0, t f ]\u00d7[a, b]\u2192[0, \u03c1 jam ] is a weak solution to the initial/boundary value problem (2.6) if for every continuously differentiable test function v(\u00b7) with compact support contained in [t 0, t f ]\u00d7[a, b], the following holds (2.8) \u222b t 0 t f \u222b a b { \u03c1 \u00b7 v t + f ( \u03c1 ) \u00b7 v x } dx dt + \u222b t 0 t f u \u00af ( t ) \u00b7 v ( t , a ) dt = 0 Definition 2.4 Entropy admissible solution A weak solution \u03c1 = \u03c1(t, x) to the scalar conservation law (2.6) satisfies the Kruzkov entropy admissibility condition if (2.9) \u222b t 0 t f \u222b a b { | \u03c1 - k | v t + sign ( \u03c1 - k ) ( f ( \u03c1 ) - f ( k ) ) v x } dx dt \u2a7e 0 for every k \u2208[0, \u03c1 jam ] and every continuously differentiable v \u2a7e0 with compact support in [t 0, t f ]\u00d7[a, b]. The boundary value problem (2.6) can now be equivalently written as a conservation law in the variable u = f(\u03c1): Proposition 2.5 Flow-based conservation law Given any concave function f(\u00b7): [0, \u03c1 jam ]\u2192[0, M] and function u \u00af ( \u00b7 ) \u2208 L 1 ( [ t 0 , t f ] ) : [ t 0 , t f ] \u2192 [ 0 , M ] , define \u03d5(\u00b7): [0, M]\u2192[0, \u03c1 \u2217] as in (2.7). Then the boundary value problem (2.6) is equivalent to the following Cauchy problem (2.10) \u2202 x u ( t , x ) + \u2202 t \u03d5 ( u ( t , x ) ) = 0 ( x , t ) \u2208 [ a , b ] \u00d7 [ t 0 , t f ] u ( t , a ) = u \u00af ( t ) where u(t, x)= f(\u03c1(t, x)). Remark 2.6 Eq. (2.10) can be viewed as an initial value problem by switching the roles of variables t and x. The flow-based PDE is easy to work with in terms of boundary conditions (2.4) and (2.5), and the initial value problem (2.10) immediately leads to the application of the Lax formula discussed in Evans (2010) and Lax (1957). Proof The proof is carried out by showing that \u03c1(t, x) is the entropy admissible weak solution of (2.6) if and only if u(t, x)\u2250 f(\u03c1(t, x)) is the entropy admissible weak solution of (2.10). 1. \u201conly if \u201d part. We begin by arguing that the weak entropy solution \u03c1(t, x) of (2.6) satisfies \u03c1(t, x)\u2208[0, \u03c1 \u2217], where \u03c1 \u2217 is the unique density such that f(\u03c1 \u2217)= M. This is because the characteristics emitting from the left boundary x = a must have non-negative wave speed in order to influence the interior of the domain [t 0, t f ]\u00d7[a, b]. Otherwise, if there exists ( t \u02c6 , x \u02c6 ) \u2208 ( t 0 , t f ] \u00d7 ( a , b ) which is connected to the left boundary [t 0, t f ]\u00d7{a} by a characteristic line with negative speed, then \u03c1 ( t \u02c6 , x \u02c6 ) is influenced by the boundary condition at a time > t \u02c6 , this contradicts the causality principle. Let \u03c1(\u00b7,\u00b7) be the weak entropy solution satisfying (2.8) and (2.9). By previous argument, there holds u = f(\u03c1), \u03c1 = \u03d5(u). Then we readily deduce 0 = \u222b t 0 t f \u222b a b { \u03c1 \u00b7 v t + f ( \u03c1 ) \u00b7 v x } dx dt + \u222b t 0 t f u \u00af ( t ) \u00b7 v ( t , a ) dt = \u222b t 0 t f \u222b a b { \u03d5 ( u ) \u00b7 v t + u \u00b7 v x } dx dt + \u222b t 0 t f u \u00af ( t ) \u00b7 v ( t , a ) dt for any continuously differentiable v with compact support. This shows that u(t, x) is the weak solution to the initial value problem (2.10). In addition, let us fix arbitrary v(t, x)\u2a7e0 which is continuously differentiable and compactly supported, for every s \u2208[0, M], denote k = \u03d5(s)\u2208[0, \u03c1 \u2217]. By the entropy condition (2.9) 0 \u2a7d \u222b t 0 t f \u222b a b { | \u03c1 - k | v t + sign ( \u03c1 - k ) ( f ( \u03c1 ) - f ( k ) ) v x } dx dt = \u222b t 0 t f \u222b a b { | \u03d5 ( u ) - \u03d5 ( s ) | v t + sign ( \u03d5 ( u ) - \u03d5 ( s ) ) ( u - s ) v x } dx dt = \u222b t 0 t f \u222b a b { | u - s | v x + sign ( u - s ) ( \u03d5 ( u ) - \u03d5 ( s ) ) v t } dx dt this implies u(\u00b7,\u00b7) is the entropy admissible solution to (2.10). Notice that the last equality above is by observing that \u03d5(\u00b7) is strictly increasing, thus | \u03d5 ( u ) - \u03d5 ( s ) | = sign ( u - s ) ( \u03d5 ( u ) - \u03d5 ( s ) ) , | u - s | = sign ( \u03d5 ( u ) - \u03d5 ( s ) ) ( u - s ) 2. \u201cif\u201d part. The converse is completely similar, the key point is that \u03c1(t, x)\u2a7d \u03c1 \u2217. Therefore f(\u03c1)= u, \u03c1 = \u03d5(u). The rest of the verification is straightforward.\u25a1 It is well-established that a full LWR-based network model requires boundary conditions on both ends of the link, which account for the propagation of upstream/downstream information. In our simplified model, in the absence of influence from downstream, the PDE for the link is constrained by just upstream boundary condition which must admit non-negative wave speeds due to the causality principle. We remind the reader that so far we have been dealing with the PDE (2.3) with boundary condition u \u00af ( t ) given by (2.5). Such a boundary condition depends on the queue q(t) and the upstream flow profiles in a tricky way: (2.5) induces a discontinuous dependence of the ODE (2.4) on the variable q(t). In general, an ODE with a discontinuous right hand side is difficult to deal with both theoretically and computationally. For example, existence for the ODE is not guaranteed. In terms of computation, a finite difference scheme, whether forward or backward, could result in non-physical solutions such as negative queue and negative flow. To overcome the aforementioned difficulties, we propose in the following a Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation corresponding to the flow-based conservation law (2.10), and a modified Lax\u2013Hopf formula which provides solution to (2.3)\u2013(2.5). 2.3 Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation and Lax\u2013Hopf formula for a homogeneous link In this section, we will first introduce the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation and the Lax formula for general Cauchy problems, then apply this to the flow-based conservation law (2.10) to obtain a semi-analytical characterization of the dynamics for a homogeneous link. Initially introduced in Lax (1957, 1973), then extended in Aubin et al. (2008), Bardi and Capuzzo-Dolcetta (1997), and Le Floch (1988), and applied to traffic theory in Claudel and Bayen (2010a), Daganzo (2005, 2006), the Lax\u2013Hopf formula provides a new characterization of the solution to the hyperbolic conservation law and Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation. The Lax formula is derived from the characteristics equations associated with the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi PDE, which arise in the classical calculus of variations and in mechanics, see Evans (2010) for a complete discussion. Consider the initial value problem for the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation (2.11) \u2202 t N ( t , x ) + H ( \u2202 x N ( t , x ) ) = 0 ( t , x ) \u2208 ( 0 , \u221e ) \u00d7 R N ( 0 , x ) = g ( x ) x \u2208 R where N : [ 0 , + \u221e ) \u00d7 R \u2192 R is the unknown, and H : R \u2192 R is the Hamiltonian. Theorem 2.7 Lax\u2013Hopf formula Suppose H is continuous and convex, g ( \u00b7 ) : R \u2192 R is Lipschitz continuous, then (2.12) N ( t , x ) = inf y \u2208 R t L x - y t + g ( y ) is the unique viscosity solution to the initial-value problem (2.11). Where L is the Legendre transformation of H : (2.13) L ( q ) = inf p { H ( p ) - qp } Proof See Evans (2010).\u25a1 The Lax\u2013Hopf formula expresses the viscosity solution of the Cauchy problem (2.11) as an optimization problem. In order to transform the flow-based PDE (2.10) into the form (2.11), let us proceed as follows. Denote the cumulative vehicle count U ( t , x ) , U \u00af ( t ) by: (2.14) U ( t , x ) = \u222b t 0 t u ( s , x ) ds , U \u00af ( t ) = \u222b t 0 t u \u00af ( s ) ds U(t, x) measures the cumulative count of vehicles that have passed the point x by time t, and U \u00af ( t ) measures the vehicle count that have entered the link. In addition, we denote by Q(t) the count of vehicles that have arrived at the entrance of the link (possibly first joining a queue) by time t. In mathematical terms, if the arc is represented by the spatial interval [a, b], then Q ( t ) = U ( t , a - ) , U \u00af ( t ) = U ( t , a + ) Notice that by definition, U \u00af ( \u00b7 ) must be Lipschitz continuous with constant M, this is because the rate at which cars enter the link is bounded above by the flow capacity, i.e., u \u00af ( t ) \u2a7d M . Regarding Q(\u00b7), we assume the following: A2 Q(\u00b7) is non-decreasing, left continuous with possibly countably many upward jumps. Remark 2.8 In most traffic literature, the function which represent flow is usually assumed to be Lebesgue integrable. Consequently, the cumulative vehicle count \u2013 the anti-derivative of flow \u2013 is absolutely continuous. Therefore A2 generalizes such assumption by allowing the cumulative count to be discontinuous. This corresponds to the situation where a positive amount of cars enter the network at the same time. Although such circumstance is unlikely to happen in reality, it does arise in a mathematical context and demands proper treatment. See Bressan and Han (2011a) for an example where a discontinuity in the cumulative vehicle count is present in the DUE solution in continuous-time. According to the rule (2.5), the relation between Q(\u00b7) and U \u00af ( \u00b7 ) can be expressed by the following identity: (2.15) U \u00af ( t ) = inf \u03c4 \u2a7d t { Q ( \u03c4 ) + M ( t - \u03c4 ) } By virtue of (2.15), U \u00af ( t ) \u2a7d Q ( t ) and the difference measure the queue volume. Notice that (2.16) is precisely the integral form of (2.4) under the assumption that q(0)=0. (2.16) q ( t ) = Q ( t ) - U \u00af ( t ) We now introduce the integral form of (2.10), which is the following Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation: (2.17) \u2202 x U ( t , x ) + \u03d5 ( \u2202 t U ( t , x ) ) = 0 ( x , t ) \u2208 [ a , b ] \u00d7 [ t 0 , t f ] U ( t , a ) = U \u00af ( t ) Note that (2.17) is in the form of a general Cauchy problem for the H\u2013J equation in one dimension, i.e. (2.11). The only difference is the notation in which the roles of t and x are switched. With that in mind, we will next proceed to the Lax formula and derive analytical solutions to (2.17). Recall the following Legendre transformation: Definition 2.9 Legendre transformation The Legendre (convex) transformation of convex function \u03d5(\u00b7): [0, M]\u2192[0, \u03c1 \u2217] is (2.18) \u03c8 ( u ) \u2250 max p { pu - \u03d5 ( p ) } It is easy to verify that the Legendre transform \u03c8(\u00b7) is convex and Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant M. Next, we adapt the Lax\u2013Hopf formula (2.12) to the Cauchy problem (2.17) and readily derive the following: Proposition 2.10 Lax\u2013Hopf formula Given convex function \u03d5(\u00b7) and its Legendre transform \u03c8(\u00b7), the viscosity solution U(t, x) to (2.17) satisfies (2.19) U ( t , x ) = min \u03c4 \u2208 R U \u00af ( \u03c4 ) + ( x - a ) \u03c8 t - \u03c4 x - a , x \u2208 [ a , b ] In particular, the cumulative count of vehicles exiting the arc is given by: (2.20) U ( t , b ) = min \u03c4 \u2208 R U \u00af ( \u03c4 ) + L \u03c8 t - \u03c4 L Proof Adjust the proof in Evans (2010) to the Cauchy problem (2.17).\u25a1 Remark 2.11 The original Lax\u2013Hopf formula used infimum instead of minimum, but since all flows that we consider here are compactly supported in [t 0, t f ], the infimum can be achieved within this compact set. Therefore, from now on, we will use \u201cmin\u201d instead of \u201cinf\u201d. As mentioned before, in a general network, the quantity Q(t) is easily recovered from upstream flow profiles. However, one cannot immediately apply formula (2.19) or (2.20) because U \u00af ( \u00b7 ) is not explicitly given. One way to resolve this issue is to utilize identity (2.15), but this would require additional computational effort. Fortunately, the following lemma asserts that this is not necessary and replacing U \u00af ( \u00b7 ) with Q(\u00b7) will yield the same solution. Proposition 2.12 Given the Lipschitz continuous function U \u00af ( \u00b7 ) and function Q(\u00b7) satisfying Assumption A2, then the solution U(t, b) satisfies (2.21) U ( t , b ) = min \u03c4 U \u00af ( \u03c4 ) + L \u03c8 t - \u03c4 L = min \u03c4 Q ( \u03c4 ) + L \u03c8 t - \u03c4 L Proof Introduce the function (2.22) \u03ba ( s ) \u2250 - L \u03c8 - s L One can then easily verify that \u03ba(\u00b7) is a concave and Lipschitz continuous function with Lipschitz constant M. From formula (2.20) it now follows (2.23) U ( t , b ) = min \u03c4 U \u00af ( \u03c4 ) - \u03ba ( \u03c4 - t ) Fix any t \u2208[t 0, t f ], denote (2.24) \u03c4 0 = inf \u03c4 \u2217 : U \u00af ( \u03c4 \u2217 ) - \u03ba ( \u03c4 \u2217 - t ) = min \u03c4 { U \u00af ( \u03c4 ) - \u03ba ( \u03c4 - t ) } Clearly \u03c4 0 exists and satisfies U \u00af ( \u03c4 0 ) - \u03ba ( \u03c4 0 - t ) = min \u03c4 { U \u00af ( \u03c4 ) - \u03ba ( \u03c4 - t ) } . Next we claim that Q ( \u03c4 0 ) = U \u00af ( \u03c4 0 ) Otherwise if Q ( \u03c4 0 ) > U \u00af ( \u03c4 0 ) , by left-continuity of Q(\u00b7), one must have Q ( \u03c4 ) > U \u00af ( \u03c4 ) for a small neighborhood \u03c4 \u2208[\u03c4 0 \u2212 \u03b4, \u03c4 0]. Thus from (2.5) we deduce that d d \u03c4 U \u00af ( \u03c4 ) = M . By Lipschitz continuity of \u03ba(\u00b7) for \u03c4 \u2208[\u03c4 0 \u2212 \u03b4, \u03c4 0] U \u00af ( \u03c4 ) - \u03ba ( \u03c4 - t ) - ( U \u00af ( \u03c4 0 ) - \u03ba ( \u03c4 0 - t ) ) \u2a7d 0 contradicting (2.24). Thereby the claim is substantiated. The claim implies (2.25) min \u03c4 { Q ( \u03c4 ) - \u03ba ( \u03c4 - t ) } \u2a7d Q ( \u03c4 0 ) - \u03ba ( \u03c4 0 - t ) = min \u03c4 { U \u00af ( \u03c4 ) - \u03ba ( \u03c4 - t ) } To show (2.25) with reversed inequality, one has only to notice Q ( \u00b7 ) \u2a7e U \u00af ( \u00b7 ) .\u25a1 Remark 2.13 Using the notation in the proof, the Lax formula (2.20) asserts that the solution U(t, b) is the amount by which we can shift upward the graph of \u03ba(\u00b7\u2212t) before hitting the graph of U \u00af ( \u00b7 ) . What Proposition 2.12 says is that such a shift does not change if U \u00af ( \u00b7 ) is replaced by Q(\u00b7). See Fig. 2 for a graphical representation. Remark 2.14 Although our formulation does not capture between-link congestion, as suggested by (2.3)\u2013(2.5), it does capture within-link congestion. In particular two sources will contribute to the within-link congestion. The first one is the non-affine density\u2013velocity relation, see Assumption A1 and Fig. 1. This means that the vehicle speed will decrease as the local density increases. The second source of congestion is interpreted from Proposition 2.12, which says that, when the inflow of a link exceeds the flow capacity, vehicles will wait in a non-physical queue (therefore there is no spillback). The waiting time is included in the link traversal time, as we shall see in the next section. In this section, we have provided a semi-analytical representation of the solution to (2.3)\u2013(2.5), this system of coupling PDEs and ODEs raises several numerical challenges such as the discontinuous dependence on the queue volume for ODE (2.4) and non-physical solution resulting from finite difference discretization. By formulating the system as a Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation and making a modification of the Lax formula, Eqs. (2.3)\u2013(2.5) are solved by the second identity of (2.21). We then extend these results to networks and incorporate travel time and route information. 2.4 Link traversal time An essential component of dynamic traffic assignment models is the travel delay operator. A significant amount of literature has assumed a link travel time expressed explicitly as a function of the state of the link; one example is the link delay model (LDM) studied in Friesz et al. (1993, 2011), Wu et al. (1998) and Xu et al. (1999). Another approach of computing travel time is via exit-flow function models. This approach is based on a description of flow dynamics and computation of the exit flow profile. Examples include M\u2013N model of Merchant and Nemhauser (1978a); the CTM of Daganzo (1994, 1995) and Vickrey model of Vickrey (1969). Notice that neither the M-N model nor the CTM defines the link traversal time. However, the traversal time can be extracted from the models using flow conservation constraint and the first-in-first-out (FIFO) assumption. For example, Newell (1993) proposed a method for computing travel time by measuring the horizontal difference of two cumulative vehicle count curves at the entry and exit of the link. A similar technique has been applied to CTM. Ziliaskopoulos (2000) considered a system-optimal DTA problem in the framework of CTM and replaced the travel time function with a cell-delay function in order to obtain a tractable mathematical program. Since our approach of network loading is based on explicit computation of the exit flow profile, we adapt an approach similar to Newell (1993) by measuring the horizontal difference between the cumulative curves Q(\u00b7) and W(\u00b7), which represent vehicle count at the entrance and exit of a link, respectively. This implicit travel time function is consistent with FIFO and will later be used to construct the turning percentages A v,e(t). Given the boundary condition Q(\u00b7), which measures the count of vehicles that have joined the queue in front of the link, the Lax formula (2.21) uniquely determines the exit profile W(\u00b7). The exit time t E for a car that enters the queue at t S is given implicitly by (2.26). (2.26) Q ( t S ) = W ( t E ) We rewrite (2.26) using a general functional D(\u00b7; Q): t S \u21a6 t E and notice that the dependence on W(\u00b7) is dropped because W(\u00b7) can be uniquely determined by Q(\u00b7) via the Lax\u2013Hopf formula. See Fig. 3 for a graphical illustration of this operator. Notice that the time spent waiting in the queue is part of the link traversal time. 2.5 Diverging model In this section we consider any node v \u2208 V with more than one outgoing arcs. We need to determine the time-varying functions A v,e(t) for each e \u2208 O v according to route information. Let us first introduce a few notations. Let P be the set of utilized paths in the network, each path p \u2208 P is defined as a collection of directed arcs p = { e 1 , e 2 , \u2026 , e m ( p ) } \u2282 A , where m(p) is the number of arcs traversed by p. For e \u2208 I v , denote P e = { p \u2208 P : e \u2208 p } . For k = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , | P e | let q k e ( t ) be the rate at which drivers in the k th group arrive at link e. Define functions \u03be k e ( t ) according to the following: (2.27) \u03be k e ( t ) \u2211 l = 1 | P e | q l e ( t ) = q k e ( t ) , k = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , | P e | In other words, \u03be k e ( t ) represents the percentage of the kth group among all groups that use arc e at time of entry t. Similarly, we define \u03b7 k e ( t ) to be the percentage of the kth group at time of exit t. For every group of drivers k using the link e, the first-in-first-out principle implies that (2.28) \u03b7 k e ( t + D ( t ; Q e ) ) = \u03be k e ( t ) , k = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , | P e | With obvious meaning of notations, (2.28) can be re-written as (2.29) Q e ( t ) = \u2211 k = 1 | P e | Q k e ( t ) , d dt Q k e ( t ) = q k e ( t ) \u03b7 k e ( t + D ( t ; Q e ) ) = q k e ( t ) \u2211 l = 1 | P e | q l e ( t ) Eq. (2.29) says that the turning percentages at a dispersive junction can be completely determined by Q k e ( t ) , k = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , | P e | . 2.6 The DAE system Summing up the previous discussion, we present a DAE system for dynamic network loading in this section. We start by introducing the following notation: A : the set of arcs in the network V : the set of nodes in the network W : the set of origin\u2013destination pairs in the network P : the set of utilized paths in the network p = { e 1 , e 2 , \u2026 , e m ( p ) } \u2208 P , e i \u2208 A : a viable path represented as the collection of arcs h p (t): departure rate associated with path p \u2208 P Q p e ( t ) : cumulative entering vehicle count of arc e \u2208 A associated with path p \u2208 P q p e ( t ) : entry flow of arc e \u2208 A associated with path p \u2208 P W p e ( t ) :cumulative exiting vehicle count of arc e \u2208 A associated with path p \u2208 P w p e ( t ) : exit flow of arc e \u2208 A associated with path p \u2208 P L e : length of arc e \u2208 A \u03c8 e : Legendre transformation shown in (2.18) and (2.21), associated with e \u2208 A D(t;Q e ): arc traversal time function of e \u2208 A when the boundary datum is Q e , and entry time is t. Q e ( t ) \u2250 \u2211 e \u2208 p Q p e ( t ) , W e ( t ) \u2250 \u2211 e \u2208 p W p e i ( t ) By convention we write q p e 1 ( t ) = h p ( t ) , w p e 0 ( t ) = h p ( t ) . The following DAE system (2.30)\u2013(2.35) summarizes our network loading procedure based on the LWR partial differential equation: (2.30) Q e ( t ) \u2250 \u2211 e \u2208 p Q p e ( t ) , q e ( t ) \u2250 \u2211 e \u2208 p q p e ( t ) , w e ( t ) \u2250 \u2211 e \u2208 p w p e ( t ) (2.31) d dt Q p e ( t ) = q p e ( t ) , d dt W e ( t ) = w e ( t ) , \u2200 p \u2208 P (2.32) q p e i ( t ) = w p e i - 1 ( t ) , i \u2208 [ 1 , m ( p ) ] , p \u2208 P (2.33) W e ( t ) = min \u03c4 Q e ( \u03c4 ) + L e \u03c8 e t - \u03c4 L e , \u2200 e \u2208 A (2.34) Q e ( t ) = W e ( t + D ( t ; Q e ) ) , \u2200 e \u2208 A (2.35) w p e i ( t + D ( t ; Q e i ) ) = q p e i ( t ) q e i ( t ) w e i ( t + D ( t ; Q e i ) ) , i \u2208 [ 1 , m ( p ) ] , p \u2208 P We note that Eq. (2.30) is merely definitional, i.e. the traffic on an arc is disaggregated according to different route choices. Eq. (2.32) represents the fundamental recursion, which compels forward flow propagation to the next arc in the path. Eq. (2.33) is the Lax formula. Eq. (2.34) is often referred to as the flow propagation constraint. It determines the travel time function D(\u00b7; Q e ) in our case. Eq. (2.35) represents the diverging model in Section 2.5. Remark 2.15 We provide some insights regarding the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the above DAE system. Notice that the system does not contain any differential equations. The only equations involving differentiation are (2.31) and they are definitional. Moreover, the Lax\u2013Hopf formula (2.33) provides the unique viscosity solution to the H\u2013J equations. In addition, all variables of interests appear explicitly on the left hand side of the equations. This permits all variables to be solved for in sequential and in a pseudo cascading fashion. Therefore, the existence and uniqueness of solution to the DAE system is clear. Remark 2.16 When we set out to solve the DNL submodel using a DAE system in the present paper, we are making a numerical approximation that can be as accurate as the modeler desires given sufficient computational resources. However, that numerical approximation should not be interpreted as an approximate DNL. 3 Formulation of the dynamic user equilibrium and Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions for the variational inequality The dynamic network loading discussed in the previous section is viewed as the numerical procedure for evaluating the effective delay operator, which is embedded in the definition of DUE proposed in Friesz et al. (1993). In this section we will re-visit the formulations of DUE as a variational inequality by Friesz et al. (1993), as a differential variational inequality by Friesz et al. (2001) and as a fixed-point problem by Friesz and Mookherjee (2006). The goal of this section is as follows: (1) we wish to provide the readers with a comprehensive review of topics related to the DUE and clear guidance on how to compute the DUE; and (2) we will utilize the Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions for finite-dimensional VIs to verify that the numerical solution we obtain is indeed the solution to the VI, and hence to the DUE problem. To the authors\u2019 knowledge this is the first attempt in the literature to test the numerical solutions against VI necessary conditions. Thus the work in this section can serve as a reference to future researchers who are interested in the computational aspects of DUE. 3.1 Dynamic user equilibrium formulation We begin by considering a planning horizon [ t 0 , t f ] \u2282 R . Let P be the set of paths employed by road users. The most crucial ingredient of the DUE model is the path delay operator. Such an operator, denoted by D p ( t , h ) \u2200 p \u2208 P maps a given vector of departure rates h to the collection of travel times. Each travel time is associated with a particular choice of route p \u2208 P and departure time t \u2208[t 0, t f ]. The path delay operators usually do not take on any closed form, instead they can only be evaluated numerically through the dynamic network loading procedure. On top of the path delay operator we introduce the effective path delay operator which generalizes the notion of travel cost to include early or late arrival penalties. In this paper we consider the effective path delay operators of the following form (3.36) \u03a8 p ( t , h ) = D p ( t , h ) + F [ t + D p ( t , h ) - T A ] \u2200 p \u2208 P where T A is the target arrival time. We introduce the fixed trip matrix Q ij : ( i , j ) \u2208 W , where each Q ij \u2208 R + is the fixed travel demand between origin\u2013destination pair ( i , j ) \u2208 W . Note that Q ij represents traffic volume, not flow. Finally we let P ij \u2282 P to be the set of paths connecting origin\u2013destination pair ( i , j ) \u2208 W . As mentioned earlier h is the vector of path flows h = { h p : p \u2208 P } . We stipulate that each path flow is square integrable, that is h \u2208 L + 2 [ t 0 , t f ] | P | The set of feasible path flows is defined as: (3.37) \u039b 0 = h \u2a7e 0 : \u2211 p \u2208 P ij \u222b t 0 t f h p ( t ) dt = Q ij \u2200 ( i , j ) \u2208 W \u2286 L + 2 [ t 0 , t f ] | P | Let us also define the essential infimum of effective travel delays v ij = essinf [ \u03a8 p ( t , h ) : p \u2208 P ij ] \u2200 ( i , j ) \u2208 W The following definition of dynamic user equilibrium was first articulated by Friesz et al. (1993) Definition 3.1 Dynamic user equilibrium A vector of departure rates (path flows) h \u2217 \u2208 \u039b 0 is a dynamic user equilibrium if h p \u2217 ( t ) > 0 , p \u2208 P ij \u21d2 \u03a8 p [ t , h \u2217 ( t ) ] = v ij We denote this equilibrium by DUE(\u03a8,\u039b 0,[t 0,t f ]). Using measure theoretic arguments, Friesz et al. (1993) established that a dynamic user equilibrium is equivalent to the following variational inequality under suitable regularity conditions: (3.38) find h \u2217 \u2208 \u039b 0 such that \u2211 p \u2208 P \u222b t 0 t f \u03a8 p ( t , h \u2217 ) h p - h p \u2217 dt \u2a7e 0 \u2200 h \u2208 \u039b 0 VI ( \u03a8 , \u039b 0 , [ t 0 , t f ] ) It has been noted in Friesz et al. (2001) that (3.38) is equivalent to a differential variational inequality. This is most easily seen by noting that the flow conservation constraints may be re-stated as: dy ij dt = \u2211 p \u2208 P ij h p ( t ) y ij ( t 0 ) = 0 y ij ( t f ) = Q ij \u2200 ( i , j ) \u2208 W which is recognized as a two point boundary value problem. As a consequence, (3.38) may be expressed as the following DVI: (3.39) find h \u2217 \u2208 \u039b such that \u2211 p \u2208 P \u222b t 0 t f \u03a8 p ( t , h \u2217 ) h p - h p \u2217 dt \u2a7e 0 \u2200 h \u2208 \u039b DVI ( \u03a8 , \u039b , [ t 0 , t f ] ) where (3.40) \u039b = h \u2a7e 0 : dy ij dt = \u2211 p \u2208 P ij h p ( t ) , y ij ( t 0 ) = 0 , y ij ( t f ) = Q ij \u2200 ( i , j ) \u2208 W Finally, we are in a position to state a result that permits the solution of the DVI (3.39) to be obtained by solving a fixed point problem. 2 The fixed-point iteration scheme should not be confused with simulation-based approaches since our iterations are merely approximations that are successively refined until convergence produces a realized system state; that is, iterations prior to convergence have no physical meaning. This is in contrast to simulation where each iteration of a simulation model produces a representation of a system state or scenario at a particular point in time. Such states are intended to directly map onto the physical world typically with associated performance measures. 2 Theorem 3.2 Fixed point re-statement Assume that \u03a8 p ( \u00b7 , h ) : [ t o , t f ] \u2192 R + is measurable for all p \u2208 P , h \u2208 \u039b . Then the fixed point problem (3.41) h \u2217 = P \u039b h \u2217 - \u03b1 \u03a8 ( t , h \u2217 ) is equivalent to DVI(\u03a8,\u039b,\u0394) where P \u039b [\u00b7] is the minimum norm projection onto \u039b and \u03b1 \u2208 R + . Proof See Friesz (2010).\u25a1 3.2 Solution algorithm based on the fixed-point iterations The fixed-point problem (3.41) can be instantiated as the following linear-quadratic optimal control problem (3.42) h \u2217 = arg min h 1 2 h \u2217 - \u03b1 \u03a8 ( t , h \u2217 ) - h : h \u2208 \u039b Then we can write the fixed point sub-problem at the kth iteration as follows (3.43) h k + 1 = arg min h 1 2 \u2016 h k - \u03b1 \u03a8 ( t , h k ) - h \u2016 2 : h \u2208 \u039b That is, we seek the solution of the optimal control problem (3.44) min h J k ( h ) = \u2211 ( i , j ) \u2208 W v ij [ Q ij - y ij ( t f ) ] + \u2211 ( i , j ) \u2208 W \u2211 p \u2208 P ij \u222b t 0 t f 1 2 h p k - \u03b1 \u03a8 p ( t , h ) - h p 2 subject to: (3.45) dy ij dt = \u2211 p \u2208 P ij h p ( t ) \u2200 ( i , j ) \u2208 W (3.46) y ij ( t 0 ) = 0 \u2200 ( i , j ) \u2208 W (3.47) h \u2a7e 0 Finding dual variables associated with terminal time demand constraints turns out to be relatively easy. Note that the relevant Hamiltonian for (3.44)\u2013(3.47) is: (3.48) H k = 1 2 m ( i , j ) \u2208 W \u2211 p \u2208 P ij h p k - \u03b1 \u03a8 p ( t , h k ) - h p 2 + \u2211 ( i , j ) \u2208 W \u03bb ij \u2211 p \u2208 P ij h p where each \u03bb ij is an adjoint variable obeying d \u03bb ij dt = ( - 1 ) \u2202 H k \u2202 y ij = 0 \u2200 ( i , j ) \u2208 W \u03bb ij ( t f ) = \u2202 v ij [ Q ij - y ij ( t f ) ] \u2202 y ij ( t f ) = - v ij \u2200 ( i , j ) \u2208 W From the above we determine that \u03bb ij ( t ) \u2261 - v ij \u2200 t \u2208 [ t 0 , t f ] , ( i , j ) \u2208 W The minimum principle implies for any p \u2208 P , h p k + 1 ( t ) = arg \u2202 H k \u2202 h p = 0 = arg h p k ( t ) - \u03b1 \u03a8 p ( t , h k ) - h p ( t ) ( - 1 ) - v ij = 0 Thus we obtain (3.49) h p k + 1 ( t ) = h p k ( t ) - \u03b1 \u03a8 p t , h k + v ij + \u2200 ( i , j ) \u2208 W , p \u2208 P ij Notice that the following flow conservation constraint applies here. \u2211 p \u2208 P ij \u222b t 0 t f h p k + 1 ( t ) dt = Q ij \u2200 ( i , j ) \u2208 W Consequently the dual variable v ij must satisfy (3.50) \u2211 p \u2208 P ij \u222b t 0 t f h p k ( t ) - \u03b1 \u03a8 p ( t , h k ) + v ij + dt = Q ij \u2200 ( i , j ) \u2208 W Recalling that each v ij is time invariant and noticing that the equations of (3.50) are uncoupled, we see that simple line searches will find the value of v ij satisfying the above conditions. Once the v ij \u2019s are determined, the new vector of path flows h k+1 for the next iteration may be computed from (3.49). Remark 3.3 The fixed-point iteration (3.43) is clearly a particular instance of the abstract algorithm x k+1 = M(x k ) for solving the fixed point problem x \u2217 = M(x \u2217). However, such an algorithm does not enjoy a general theorem assuring strong convergence of {x k }, even when M(\u00b7) is non-expansive. This is so because the effective delay operator is not strongly monotone or component-wise strongly pseudomonotone delay operators. Further analytical properties need to be extracted from the current model to shed more light on the convergence issue. This has been left as future research. It should be noted that in all the numerical studies we present below, the fixed-point iterations do meet the convergence criteria, that is (3.51) \u2016 h k + 1 - h k \u2016 L 2 \u2016 h k \u2016 L 2 \u2a7d \u03b5 , for some k where \u03b5 is some user-defined threshold. 3.3 Kuhn\u2013Tucker condition for finite-dimensional VIs This section focuses on the variational inequality (3.38). To derive a finite-dimensional version of VI (3.38), we introduce a uniform time grid with step size \u0394t: (3.52) t 0 = t 1 < t 2 < \u22ef < t n = t f We will use this notation: h \u00af p , i \u2250 h p ( t i ) \u2208 R , h \u00af p \u2250 ( h \u00af p , i ) i = 1 n \u2208 R n , h \u00af \u2250 ( h \u00af p ) p \u2208 P \u2208 R n \u00d7 | P | , \u03a8 \u00af p , i ( h \u00af ) \u2250 \u03a8 p ( t i , h ) , \u03a8 \u00af p ( h \u00af ) \u2250 \u03a8 \u00af p , i ( h \u00af ) i = 1 n \u2208 R n \u03a8 \u00af ( h \u00af ) \u2250 \u03a8 \u00af p ( h \u00af ) p \u2208 P \u2208 R n \u00d7 | P | Q = ( Q ij ) ( i , j ) \u2208 W \u2208 R | W | Next we apply rectangular quadrature for the approximation of integrals, then the discrete-time version of inequality in (3.38) becomes \u2211 p \u2208 P \u0394 t \u03a8 \u00af p ( h \u00af \u2217 ) T h \u00af p - h \u00af p \u2217 \u2a7e 0 \u21d4 \u03a8 \u00af ( h \u00af \u2217 ) T ( h \u00af - h \u00af \u2217 ) \u2a7e 0 The flow conservation constraints become \u2211 p \u2208 P ij \u0394 te T h \u00af p = Q ij , \u2200 ( i , j ) \u2208 W where e \u2208 R n is the vector of ones. We now introduce the following compact notation (3.53) \u03b1 ( \u00b7 ) : R n \u00d7 | P | \u2192 R n \u00d7 | P | , \u03b1 ( h \u00af ) = - h \u00af (3.54) \u03b2 ( \u00b7 ) : R n \u00d7 | P | \u2192 R n \u00d7 | P | , \u03b2 ( h \u00af ) = A \u00b7 h \u00af - Q / \u0394 t where each row of the matrix A \u2208 R | W | \u00d7 n | P | has ones located at the spots corresponding to OD pair (i, j) and zeros elsewhere. \u039b \u00af 0 can be rewritten as: \u039b \u00af 0 = { h \u00af \u2208 R n \u00d7 | P | : \u03b1 ( h \u00af ) \u2a7d 0 ; \u03b2 ( h \u00af ) = 0 } We now we are ready to state the discrete-time variational inequality VI \u00af ( \u03a8 , \u039b 0 , [ t 0 , t f ] ) and the necessary condition for this finite-dimensional VI: (3.55) find h \u00af \u2217 \u2208 \u039b \u00af 0 such that \u03a8 \u00af ( h \u00af \u2217 ) T ( h \u00af - h \u00af \u2217 ) \u2a7e 0 \u2200 h \u00af \u2208 \u039b \u00af 0 VI \u00af ( \u03a8 \u00af , \u039b \u00af 0 , [ t 0 , t f ] ) where (3.56) \u039b \u00af 0 = h \u00af \u2208 R n \u00d7 | P | : \u03b1 ( h \u00af ) \u2a7d 0 ; \u03b2 ( h \u00af ) = 0 Theorem 3.4 (Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions for VI \u00af ( \u03a8 \u00af , \u039b \u00af 0 , [ t 0 , t f ] ) ). Let h \u00af \u2217 \u2208 \u039b \u00af 0 = h \u00af \u2208 R n \u00d7 | P | : \u03b1 ( h \u00af ) \u2a7d 0 ; \u03b2 ( h \u00af ) = 0 be a solution of (3.55). Further assume that \u03a8 \u00af ( \u00b7 ) and \u03b1(\u00b7) are continuous on \u039b \u00af 0 , \u03b1 ( \u00b7 ) is differentiable on \u039b \u00af 0 , and \u03b2(\u00b7) is affine on \u039b \u00af 0 . Then if the gradients \u2207 \u03b1 i ( h \u00af \u2217 ) for i such that g i ( h \u00af \u2217 ) = 0 together with the gradients \u2207 \u03b2 i ( h \u00af \u2217 ) for i = 1 , \u2026 , n \u00d7 | P | are linearly independent, there exists multipliers \u03c0 \u2208 R n \u00d7 | P | and \u03bc \u2208 R n \u00d7 | P | such that (3.57) \u03a8 \u00af ( h \u00af \u2217 ) + [ \u2207 \u03b1 ( h \u00af \u2217 ) ] T \u03c0 + [ \u2207 \u03b2 ( h \u00af \u2217 ) ] T \u03bc = 0 (3.58) \u03c0 i \u03b1 i ( h \u00af \u2217 ) = 0 , i = 1 , \u2026 , n \u00d7 | P | (3.59) \u03c0 \u2a7e 0 Proof See Friesz (2010).\u25a1 Remark 3.5 The functions \u03b1(\u00b7), \u03b2(\u00b7) clearly satisfy the assumption of the above theorem. Regarding the continuity of the effective delay operator \u03a8(\u00b7,\u00b7) in continuous time, we refer the readers to Bressan and Han (2012) for a proof. The continuity of \u03a8 \u00af ( \u00b7 ) in Theorem 3.4 follows directly from the continuity of \u03a8(\u00b7,\u00b7). We further comment that the necessary conditions for the VI become sufficient if in addition the constraint functions \u03b1(\u00b7) are convex, which is again true in our case. Next, we will transform condition (3.59) and (3.57) into a linear system. Note \u2207 \u03b1 ( h \u00af \u2217 ) = - I , \u2207 \u03b2 ( h \u00af \u2217 ) = A where I is the n | P | \u00d7 n | P | identity matrix. Let \u03a9 = diag ( - h \u00af \u2217 ) \u2208 R n | P | \u00d7 n | P | , Eqs. (3.59) and (3.57) is equivalent to the following linear system (3.60) - I A \u03a9 0 \u03c0 \u03bc = - \u03a8 \u00af ( h \u00af \u2217 ) 0 In order to verify the sufficient and necessary condition (3.57)\u2013(3.59), one needs to solve the above system and verify that the dual variables \u03c0 \u2a7e0. Notice that the size of such system is 2 n | P | \u00d7 ( n | P | + | W | ) which could be very large.The Sioux Falls network example presented in Section 4.5 has 496 O\u2013D pairs and 1941 paths. A chosen time grid of 100 points will lead to a 400,000\u00d7200,500 linear system. Such a large system will cause the solution procedure to significantly slow down and even crash if the system is not well-conditioned. We present our resolution to this issue with a decomposition of the system (3.60) summarized in the next lemma. Lemma 3.6 Decomposition of the linear system For i = 1 , \u2026 , | W | , denote by \u03a8 \u00af i ( h \u00af \u2217 ) , \u03c0 i , \u03bc i the vectors formed by selecting the rows corresponding to the i th OD pair of the original vectors; denote by I i , A i , \u03a9 i the submatrices formed by selecting the rows and colomns corresponding to the ith OD pair of the original matrices. The linear system (3.60) is then equivalent to a collection of smaller systems (3.61) - I i A i \u03a9 i 0 \u03c0 i \u03bc i = - \u03a8 \u00af i ( h \u00af \u2217 ) 0 i = 1 , \u2026 , | W | Proof The conclusion follows from a simple block matrix arithmetic.\u25a1 Each system in (3.61) is much smaller in size, however, one may have to solve such linear systems as many times as the number of OD pairs. This strategy is particularly useful when computer memory is insufficient for large-scale computation. 4 Numerical examples In this section, we present several numerical studies of the proposed DNL procedure formulated as a DAE system (2.30)\u2013(2.35). In particular, we consider four different vehicular networks of varying sizes and topologies, as summarized in Table 1 . All computations of the DNL procedure and fixed-point iteration presented in this section were coded in Matlab 2010 and performed on a 2.7GHz 4GB of RAM computer. Every attempt was made to avoid the use of numerical tricks that could not be equally applied to all models. For the numerical results of the DNL, the LWR-based DAE system presented in this paper displays different flow propagation patterns from the LDM and CTM link performance models studied in Friesz et al. (2011). The solutions for the latter are moving parabolic wave forms, while the solutions of our DNL procedure display the non-uniformity of wave speeds \u2013 a key feature of kinematic wave models. This is best explained by the flux function \u03d5(\u00b7) defined in (2.7), which implies that the higher the flow, the slower it propagates. This property will be visualized in Section 4.3. 4.1 Numerical context For all numerical examples presented in this section, we fixed the time horizon [0,20]. The effective delay takes on the following form \u03a8 p ( t , h ) = D p ( t , h ) + \u03b3 \u00d7 ( t + D p ( t , h ) - T A ) 2 where D p (t, h) is the network delay operator for path p \u2208 P and T A is the target arrival time. We assumed that there is a quadratic penalty for arrivals other than the desired time. The parameter \u03b3 \u2208 R + measures the network users\u2019 perception of arrival penalties and is allowed to depend on different user classes. As the initial iterate of the fixed-point algorithm, we utilize an inverse parabolic-shaped initial departure rate. Note that an appropriate pre-condition, such as a different initial guesses may improve the performance of the fixed-point algorithm, but this is beyond the scope of this paper. Finally, the convergence criteria of the fixed-point algorithm was set to be (3.51). 4.2 Simple network In this section we consider the two-arc, two-node network with arc parameters illustrated in Fig. 4 . This simple network has only one origin\u2013destination pair W = { 1 , 2 } and two paths p 1 ={1} and p 2 ={2}. We assumed a fixed travel demand of Q 1,2 =3300 and set the desired arrival time T A =15. With the DNL procedure proposed in this paper, it took the fixed-point algorithm 15 iterations to meet the convergence criteria. The equilibrium flows are illustrated in Fig. 5 , where a clear flat spot in the travel cost curve can be visualized. As the iterations progress on, more traffic volume will switch from the second path to the first path, as shown in Fig. 6 . This is consistent with the network parameters we chose. 4.3 Small network We consider the small network summarized in Fig. 7 , with six-arc and five-node. There are two OD pairs W = { ( 1 , 3 ) , ( 2 , 3 ) } among which, the following six paths are employed: p 1 = { 3 , 6 } , p 2 = { 1 , 2 , 6 } , p 3 = { 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 } , p 4 = { 3 , 4 , 5 } p 5 = { 6 } , p 6 = { 4 , 5 } We assume a fixed demand for OD pair (1,3) and (2,3) such that Q 1,3 =3300 and Q 2,3 =1650. The target arrival times of each OD pair are set to be T (1,3) =10 and T (2,3) =14. It took the fixed-point algorithm 12 iterations to terminate. The DUE solutions are shown in Fig. 8 . We note that the curve corresponding to travel cost is flat where the departure rate is nonzero. Fig. 9 shows the propagation of several path flows along each arc. As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the LWR-based models tend to display non-uniform wave speeds, i.e. the part of the flow profile with relatively high value will propagate more slowly than the part with low value. 4.4 Medium network We now consider the 19-arc, 13-node network shown in Fig. 10 , also studied in Nguyen (1984) and Nie and Zhang (2008). The following four OD pairs are chosen: W = { ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 1 , 3 ) , ( 4 , 2 ) , ( 4 , 3 ) } each having a fixed travel demand of Q 1,2 = Q 1,3 = Q 4,2 = Q 4,3 =275. The target arrival times for the four OD pairs are T (1,2) = T (1,3) = T (4,2) = T (4,3) =12. We employ only one path per OD pair. Specifically, P = { p 1 , p 2 , p 3 , p 4 } and p 1 = { 1 , 4 , 13 } , p 2 = { 2 , 10 , 17 , 19 } , p 3 = { 9 , 14 , 15 , 16 } , p 4 = { 9 , 17 , 19 } The primary purpose of this network example is to study the effect of bottlenecking on DUE solutions and how the bottleneck is handled by our algorithm. To do so, we set the network parameters in such a way that arc 9 becomes a bottleneck, i.e. it has smaller flow capacity and free flow compared to than the rest of the arcs in the network. Under this numerical setting, the DUE solution is obtained after 10 fixed-point iterations. Four path flows are shown in Fig. 11 . We observe from the solution that the paths p 3 and p 4, which pass the bottleneck, have higher peak rates than paths p 1 and p 2. This observation implies that equilibrium flows tend to aggravate congestions at bottlenecks as confirmed by Bressan and Han (2011a). Given that the bottleneck (arc 9) has a flow capacity of 200, Fig. 12 demonstrates the equilibrium flows through the arc. We make the following comments concerning Fig. 12: (1) the flow capacity of arc 9 is captured by the Lax-formula approach as shown in the lower figure; (2) a clear shock wave is represented as a sudden drop of flow around t =12.6; and (3) the entry and exit flows of arc 9 are successfully disaggregated by the routing information as well as our diverging model and numerical implementation. 4.5 Sioux Falls network, part I The aim of this section is to demonstrate the ability of our DNL procedure to compute large-scale problems. We considered the well-known Sioux Falls network (Fig. 13 ) consisting of 76 arcs and 24 nodes. We selected a total number of 496 origin\u2013destination pairs and 1941 paths. For each OD pair, we assumed a fixed travel demand ranging from 200 to 2000 and target arrival time ranging from 8 to 16. The fixed-point algorithm took 17 iterations to converge. Selected DUE solutions are presented in Figs. 14\u201319 . These figures show departure rates of four paths, p 300, p 500, p 850 and p 1902 and the corresponding unit cost. Fig. 18 shows the evolution of path allocations within the OD pair (18,20) at each fixed-point iteration. Several arc entry flows in the solution are depicted in Fig. 19. We tested our numerical solution against the KT conditions mentioned in Theorem 3.4; the resulting linear system is decomposed using Lemma 3.6. To confirm that our numerical solution indeed solved the DUE problem on Sioux Falls network, we tested it against the KT conditions instantiated in Theorem 3.4 and Lemma 3.6. The whole linear system was decomposed into smaller systems according to different O\u2013Ds, and all the resulting dual variables are non-negative. 4.6 Sioux Falls network, part II The analytical framework of this paper belongs to the class of path-based DUE models. In other words, a (partial) path enumeration is necessary for the analysis and computation of DUE to carry forward. The first part of the Sioux Falls study resulted in four paths per OD pair on average. However, the reader should notice that many OD pairs have adjacent origins and destinations (e.g. nodes 4 and 5). It is considered \u2018unlikely\u2019 that users will select many paths for such OD pairs. In order to further illustrate the influence of network congestion and travel demand on the number of utilized paths, we propose the second part the Sioux Falls numerical study. This also explores the limitation of insufficient path enumeration. Under the same link parameters as the previous section, we only consider one OD pair (1,20) with a total of 125 paths. Although the number of paths is still small compared to the total number of viable paths, it is sufficient to serve the purpose of this section. We performed the computation of the DUE 19 times, with an increased travel demand ranging from 104 to 105. The numbers of utilized paths in the corresponding equilibrium solutions are plotted in Fig. 20 . It is observed that as the demand is relatively low, the increase of utilized paths is faster than when the demand is higher. When the demand is very high (i.e. Q 12 \u2a7e7\u00d7104) the demand needs to increase significantly for the drivers to use a new path. 4.7 Performance of the network loading procedure The fixed-point algorithm presented in this paper was implemented with several network loading models. The link delay model is based on an explicit travel time function and the corresponding DNL procedure was approximated by a system of ODEs in Friesz et al. (2011). The cell transmission model proposed in Daganzo (1994) and Daganzo (1995) is a widely used discrete-time traffic network model. These two network loading procedures, together with the one presented in this paper, were tested against different networks. The numerical performances are summarized in Table 2 . We name our procedure \u201cLWR-LH\u201d with \u201cLH\u201d standing for the Lax\u2013Hopf formula. Notice that in Table 2, the results of the 76-arc, 24-node (Sioux Falls network) were based on a choice of 10 OD pairs and 200 paths for all three DNL procedures. We observe from these numerical examples that the LWR-based network loading algorithm presented here was more efficient than its counterparts for large-scale networks. We interpret this result as follows: the CTM model is a discrete model that requires a two-dimensional space\u2013time grid. This could be potentially inefficient in terms of the number of operations performed and memory usage. The LDM is based on solving a system of ODEs; the size of such a system grows linearly with path numbers. The ODE solver could slow down dramatically. The ODE solver could slow down dramatically when computing large-scale networks with over 1000 paths. LWR-based loading algorithm presented here is a link-based algorithm, i.e. the formula (2.33) is performed only once for each link. In addition, the loading procedure is further accelerated by the closed-form representation of the PDE solutions and independence of the spatial variables. The fixed-point algorithm with the proposed DNL procedure was performed on the Sioux Falls network with varying problem sizes. See Table 3 for a summary of the algorithm\u2019s formance. In particular, a below-linear growth of solution time, with respect to the number of paths, is reported. 5 Conclusion In this article, we propose a continuous-time network loading procedure based on the LWR model and a novel solution method based on the Lax formula. The DNL sub-problem is formulated as a DAE system without any partial derivatives and the solution to the PDE is expressed semi-analytically. The DNL model captures network queuing, route and departure time choices, as well as path delays. The proposed network loading procedure was implemented within the fixed-point algorithm for computing the dynamic user equilibrium. The numerical performance of the DNL procedure was tested extensively using various network examples, including the Sioux Falls network with nearly 500 OD pairs and 2000 paths. The variational approach for conservation laws and Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equations has become a recognized analytical and computational tool. It has the full potential to capture the formation and interaction of kinematic waves within a link. One drawback of the network model discussed in this paper is the absence of vehicle spillback. Thus the DNL procedure tends to underestimate path delays when the network is heavily congested. In order to capture the interaction of kinematic waves among links and address spillback, the analytical framework presented needs to be extended to consider both upstream and downstream boundary conditions. This is not difficult to achieve using the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation and the Lax\u2013Hopf formula. The solution of the H\u2013J equation with multiple boundary conditions can be viewed as the lower envelop of solutions that are each obtained with one boundary condition. See Aubin et al. (2008), Claudel and Bayen (2010a), Daganzo (2005) for detailed discussion. In Han et al. (2012b), the variational method has been implemented to the network model based on the discussion above. By choosing appropriate Riemann Solvers at different junctions, the system dynamics can be again formulated as a DAE system. Also in Han et al. (2012b), binary variables are used to indicate the traffic states (i.e. free-flow or congested) at the beginning and end of each link. The phenomenon of spillback is explicitly modeled by these binary variables even in continuous-time. Further understanding of the network loading model above; in terms of solution existence for arbitrary network topology and continuity of the delay operator, is the goal of future research.
