"Transportation Research Part B: MethodologicalModels for technology choice in a transit corridor with elastic demandAbstract We present two optimization models for a transit line under the assumption that the demand is elastic and can be approximated by a linear function of fare and passenger travel time components. These models can be used to strategically evaluate technology choices. We study the effect of demand elasticity on the technology choice by analytic and numerical comparison with some fixed demand models. We assume a range of objective functions having as two extrema the maximization of operator\u2019s profit and the maximization of social welfare. We show both analytically and numerically that accounting for demand elasticity does not change the conclusions that can be derived by an equivalent fixed demand model. This invariance holds for a broad range of objective functions in the elastic case. The significant difference between the two objective function extrema lies in the proportions of captured demand.serial JL 271728 291210 291772 291817 31 Transportation Research Part B: Methodological TRANSPORTATIONRESEARCHPARTBMETHODOLOGICAL 2017-06-09 2017-06-09 2017-09-12 2017-09-12 2018-06-28T01:03:19 1-s2.0-S019126151630947X S0191-2615(16)30947-X S019126151630947X 10.1016/j.trb.2017.06.001 S300 S300.2 FULL-TEXT 1-s2.0-S0191261517X00064 2018-06-28T08:58:44.7934Z 0 0 20171001 20171031 2017 2017-06-09T23:38:18.615878Z articleinfo articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright crossmark dateloaded dateloadedtxt datesearch datesort dateupdated dco docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid indexeddate issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdateend pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype ssids alllist content subj subheadings suppl tomb volfirst volissue volumelist webpdf webpdfpagecount yearnav figure table body mmlmath acknowledge affil appendices articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authkeywords authlast grantnumber grantsponsor grantsponsorid highlightsabst primabst ref 0191-2615 01912615 true 104 104 C Volume 104 37 733 756 733 756 201710 October 2017 2017-10-01 2017-10-31 2017 article fla \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Highlights \u2022 We present two optimization models for a transit line with elastic demand. \u2022 These models allow a strategic comparison of mode choices. \u2022 We devise an equivalence scheme between fixed and elastic demand models. \u2022 Elastic demand does not change the conclusions offered by a fixed demand model. \u2022 Profit maximization yields half captured demand than social welfare maximization. Abstract We present two optimization models for a transit line under the assumption that the demand is elastic and can be approximated by a linear function of fare and passenger travel time components. These models can be used to strategically evaluate technology choices. We study the effect of demand elasticity on the technology choice by analytic and numerical comparison with some fixed demand models. We assume a range of objective functions having as two extrema the maximization of operator\u2019s profit and the maximization of social welfare. We show both analytically and numerically that accounting for demand elasticity does not change the conclusions that can be derived by an equivalent fixed demand model. This invariance holds for a broad range of objective functions in the elastic case. The significant difference between the two objective function extrema lies in the proportions of captured demand. Keywords Transit optimization Elastic demand Mohring effect Bus rapid transit Light rail transit 1 Introduction The research question considered in this paper is the effect of demand elasticity on the technology choice for a transit line. We extend the transit technology choice models of Moccia and Laporte (2016) by assuming an elastic demand which depends linearly on the fare and passenger travel time components. We posit a general setting where passenger travel time components depend non-linearly on the demand level or other operating variables. For example, we incorporate in the in-vehicle time a crowding penalty which is a function of the vehicle load ratio. We assume a range of objective functions having as two extrema the maximization of operator\u2019s profit and the maximization of social welfare. Our contribution is the demonstration of an equivalence scheme between fixed and elastic demand optimization models. Its significance is twofold. First, the equivalence scheme is instrumental to an effective solution method for the elastic demand optimization model. A bounding procedure and a decomposition scheme are presented. Second, we show both analytically and numerically that accounting for demand elasticity does not change the conclusions that can be derived by an equivalent fixed demand model. For a given level of captured demand, the optimal configuration and the operating policies are invariant with respect to the assumptions on the demand model, fixed or elastic. This invariance holds for a broad range of objective functions in the elastic case. The break-even points between technologies do not change when demand elasticity is considered. The approximated proportion of captured demand under profit maximization is circa half of that under social welfare maximization. These results do not rely on a specific assumption on the fare elasticity parameter. When the fare elasticity is very small the proportion of captured demand tends to the derived upper bound. 1.1 Literature review The literature on structural transit analysis was initiated by Byrne (1975) for radial lines, by Newell (1979) for a hub-and-spoke network, by Vaughan (1986) for ring and radial routes, and by Chien and Schonfeld (1998) for a rail trunk line with a feeder bus service. In recent years several continuous approximation-based studies have addressed the strategic evaluation of transit technologies (Daganzo, 2010; Estrada et al., 2011; Badia et al., 2014; Sivakumaran et al., 2014). The main research question that we are dealing with is the effect of demand elasticity on the optimal configuration of a transit line, and hence in Section 1.1.1 we limit our review to some studies that compare fixed and elastic demand models. Another literature thread of concern, the assessment of passenger in-vehicle crowding, is briefly discussed in Section 1.1.2. 1.1.1 Comparison of fixed and elastic demand models Kocur and Hendrickson (1982) studied the design of a local bus service under linear elastic demand and where the optimized variables are line spacing, headway and fare. Three objective functions were analyzed, namely profit maximization, maximization of a combination of consumer surplus and operator profit, and maximization of consumer surplus subject to a budget constraint. The derived closed form solutions are such that there is a proportionality between headway and line spacing for all the elastic demand objective functions. The authors noted that the same result was obtained by Hurdle (1973) adopting a fixed demand model. Moreover, the authors observed that there is little variation in the optimal values of line spacing and headway from the user\u2019s perspective across the range of objective function studied, and they defined this finding as \u201csurprising\u201d. Chang and Schonfeld (1991) studied single- and multi-period bus networks where there are both a line haul section and a local service area. These authors presented fixed and elastic demand models and compared total cost minimization, and profit and social welfare maximizations. Some of their findings are commented in Appendix A.1. Tirachini et al. (2010) compared transit technologies for a single line under fixed and elastic demand models and where the optimized variable is the frequency. One of their results relevant to our paper is that the optimal frequency under social welfare maximization is approximately 2 times larger than under profit maximization. This finding is commented in Appendix A.2. Daganzo (2012), under very general assumptions valid not only for transportation but for public services at large, established conditions for the decomposition between system design and control, and demand forecasting and pricing. In the case of consumer surplus as a metric for the net user benefit, the studied objective of an endogenous demand model is the maximization of the sum of the consumer surplus and of the net benefit to the rest of society (the operator profit plus the balance of the externalities). The optimality conditions for the system design and control variables of the former model are proved to be equivalent to those of the generalized system cost minimization at the optimal demand level. In the case of a for-profit operator, the socially optimal design and operating scheme can be induced by a specific payment formula set by a public agency. A related topic is the optimal transit service supply under fixed and elastic demand models. Van Reeven (2008) questioned the rationale for fare subsidization by presenting a model with endogenous demand where the optimal frequency of a for-profit operator is the same as that of a public agency that maximizes social welfare. This result contradicts the fixed demand model of Mohring (1972) where economies of scale on the passenger waiting cost were found to motivate fare subsidization. Basso and Jara-D\u00edaz (2010), and Savage and Small (2010) reassessed in an elastic demand framework the rationale for transit fare subsidization. Savage and Small (2010) noted that the result of Van Reeven (2008) critically depends on a strong reduction of the effect of fare on demand. Basso and Jara-D\u00edaz (2010) derived optimal frequencies for profit and social welfare maximizations such that the latter is always larger than the former. 1.1.2 Passenger in-vehicle crowding Wardman and Whelan (2010) reviewed studies on rail crowding in Great Britain. Crowding conditions, in the form of load factor or standing passengers per unit of area, influence the value of time of both seated and standing passengers. Crowding appears to affect the value of time of seated passengers as soon as 50% of the seats are occupied, albeit the worsening is minor at this load factor and occurs only for leisure trips. The most recent and comprehensive studies reviewed by Wardman and Whelan (2010) indicate that the crowding multiplier of the base in-vehicle time with respect to the load factor is well approximated by a piecewise linear function which is equal to one up to the load factor corresponding to the seated capacity, and then starts to increase linearly. More recently, H\u00f6rcher et al. (2017) used large scale automated demand and train location data to estimate the user cost of crowding in a revealed preference route choice framework. A linear crowding multiplier model was validated, and this study found that at six passengers per square meter and no chance to find a seat, the value of time circa doubles. The authors observed that these new travel time multipliers were comparable in magnitude but somewhat lower than earlier stated preference results. 1.2 Organization of the paper The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents mathematical models. Section 3 analyzes the models and introduces solution methods. Computational results are discussed in Section 4, and Section 5 reports some conclusions. 2 Models As in Moccia and Laporte (2016), we assume that a transit line of length L serves a bidirectional demand. The difference with respect to the previous paper is that we remove the assumption that the demand is fixed. Similarly to Kocur and Hendrickson (1982), Chang and Schonfeld (1991), and Tirachini et al. (2010), we express the demand captured by transit as a linear function of fare and average passenger travel time components. A linear demand model can be regarded as an approximation to logit and other demand models typically used in transportation planning. A caveat of this type of approximation is that it may be unreliable at the extrema of the demand range (Kocur and Hendrickson, 1982). However, this does not apply to our analysis since we do not deal with the question of determining whether or not there should be a transit line. In the proposed model the fare is a decision variable and the passenger travel time is composed of three parts: access and egress, waiting, and in-vehicle times. These travel time components depend on the following variables: the stop spacing, denoted by d, the frequency, f, and the length of the transit unit (TU), n. Frequency is expressed as the number of TUs per hour. The concept of transit unit, as presented in Vuchic (2005), refers to a set of n physically linked vehicles traveling together. For single-vehicle operations, such as buses, n is equal to one, whereas for rail technology n can be larger than one and in that case is an integer variable to be optimized. We introduce both a single- and a two-period model. In a single-period model the variables and the techno-economic coefficients are related to an average peak hour. This model allows to derive some analytic properties that are then deployed in a more realistic two-period model where variables and coefficients are related to both peak and off-peak average service hours. In the following we use the notation and the formulae of the fixed demand models of Moccia and Laporte (2016), although the presented elastic models are of more general scope as exemplified in Appendix A. We first introduce the single-period model in Section 2.1, and in Section 2.2 we present the two-period model. 2.1 Single-period model In the single-period model the maximum demand at peak hours is y, and the captured demand Y is a fraction of y. The average access and egress time ta is a function of the stop spacing d. Passengers access and egress the nearest stop at speed v, hence the average access and egress distances are both equal to d/4, the average total access and egress distance is d/2, and the average access and egress time ta of a passenger is (1) t a = d 2 v . The average waiting time tw is a function of the frequency f. This function can include the effect of schedule delay as follows. Passenger behavior differs for low and high frequencies. In the case of high frequencies, passengers arrive at stops at a constant rate and the average waiting time tw can be modeled as a fraction \u03f5 \u2265 1/2 of the expected headway equal to 1/f. Values of \u03f5 strictly larger than 1/2 can model cases where the headways have a large variance. In the case of low frequencies, passengers follow timetables and arrive at stops w minutes before the expected time of service. The waiting time saved by this behavior still has a cost for the passenger but is discounted by a factor \u03bc less than one. The threshold frequency for these two behavior regimes is defined by f \u00af , for example five transit units per hour, which results in a headway of 12 min. The average waiting time tw of a passenger is (2) t w = { w + \u03bc \u03f5 f if f < f \u00af \u03f5 f if f \u2265 f \u00af . The average in-vehicle time can be modeled as a fraction of the cycle time which depends on the frequency, on the stop spacing, on the TU length, and on the captured demand Y which determines the boarding and alighting component of the cycle time as described in the following. Because of this dependence of the cycle time on the demand level, we denote the average in-vehicle time by t v, Y , and the average cycle time by t c,Y . Let \u03b2v be the boarding and alighting time per vehicle and per passenger, Vmax be the maximum speed, and Tl be the lost time for acceleration, deceleration, and door opening and closing. The cycle time t c,Y is then (3) t c , Y ( f , n , d ) = Y n f \u03b2 v + 2 L d T l + 2 L V m a x . The average in-vehicle time includes a crowding multiplier that depends on the average vehicle load ratio \u03b8Y . The average vehicle load ratio is inversely proportional to the frequency and to the consist length (4) \u03b8 Y ( f , n ) = l Y 2 L k v n f , where l is the length of the average trip and kv the capacity of a vehicle. The crowding multiplier \u03b4Y is equal to one, i.e. there is no crowding penalty, when the average vehicle load ratio does not exceed a threshold \u03b8min related to the ratio of seats to total capacity, for example. The crowding multiplier increases linearly with a slope \u03c1 for larger load ratios. Thus, the average in-vehicle time is here interpreted as an equivalent time which includes discomfort for crowding, if any. Formally, the penalty function is (5) \u03b4 Y ( f , n ) = { 1 + \u03c1 ( \u03b8 Y \u2212 \u03b8 m i n ) = \u03be + \u03c1 l Y 2 L k v n f if n f \u2264 l Y 2 \u03b8 m i n L k v 1 otherwise , where \u03be = 1 \u2212 \u03b8 m i n \u03c1 is a parameter introduced for notational compactness. The average in-vehicle time then becomes (6) t v , Y ( f , n , d ) = \u03b4 Y ( f , n ) l 2 L t c , Y ( f , n , d ) . We can now express the captured demand as a linear function of the average travel time components and fare: (7) Y ( f , n , d , P ) = y ( 1 \u2212 e a t a ( d ) \u2212 e w t w ( f ) \u2212 e v t v , Y ( f , n , d ) \u2212 e P P ) , where ea, ew , and ev are the elastic demand parameters for access, waiting, and in-vehicle times, P is the fare, and eP is the elastic demand parameter for fare. This formula is recursive, since the in-vehicle travel time depends on Y. We denote by k the terms in (7) that are in a first approximation independent of P, (8) k = 1 \u2212 e a t a ( d ) \u2212 e w t w ( f ) \u2212 e v t v , Y ( f , n , d ) . We use the following compact equation for the elastic demand as a function of fare, (9) Y ( P ) = y ( k \u2212 e P P ) . The net passenger welfare Wp is the difference between the total willingness to pay and what passengers actually pay. Similarly to Tirachini et al. (2010), Wp is computed as illustrated in Fig. 1 : (10) W p ( f , n , d , P ) = Y ( f , n , d , P ) 2 2 e P y . The operator profit Wo is the difference between the revenue, the product of fare and captured demand, and the operator cost. The operator cost C o,Y depends on the frequency, the stop spacing, the TU length, and the captured demand level Y as follows. We disaggregate the fixed infrastructure cost into two components: c 0l , the fixed hourly cost of the line, and c 0s , the fixed hourly cost of a stop. The terms c 0l and c 0s account for the construction and maintenance costs of the line and of a stop, respectively. We distinguish between the TU costs and the vehicle costs. Let c 1t be the unit operator cost per TU-hour, and let c 1v be the unit operator cost per vehicle-hour. The former parameter accounts for the crew cost, and the latter for the capital cost of vehicles. Let c 2v be the unit operator cost per vehicle-km. The deployed fleet size B of TUs is the product of frequency and cycle time: B = f t c , Y . The vehicle fleet size is equal to nB, and the amount of vehicle-km is 2nLf. The operator cost is then (11) C o , Y ( f , n , d ) = c 0 l + c 0 s 2 L d + c 1 t f t c , Y ( f , n , d ) + c 1 v n f t c , Y ( f , n , d ) + 2 c 2 v n L f . Thus, the operator profit is (12) W o ( f , n , d , P ) = Y ( f , n , d , P ) P \u2212 C o , Y ( f , n , d ) . The single-period model with elastic demand has the following objective: (13) maximize W = \u03d5 W p + W o , where \u03d5 is parameter ranging from zero to one. Setting \u03d5 equal to zero maximizes the operator profit, setting \u03d5 equal to one maximizes the social welfare, which is the sum of the net passenger welfare and of the operator profit, and an intermediate value of \u03d5 maximizes the sum of the operator profit and of a fraction \u03d5 of the net passenger welfare. The constraints of this optimization model are those that define feasible ranges for the frequency, stop spacing, and TU length as explained in the following. We synthetically indicate the feasible range for the frequency as the interval between a minimal frequency f min,Y which depends on the TU length and the captured demand, and a maximum frequency fmax which is technology-dependent. Following Tirachini et al. (2010), Moccia and Laporte (2016) accounted for spatial demand variability by the parameter \u03b1. Let \u03b1Y be the largest load served by the line, where 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1, and let \u03bd be a spare capacity factor, for example \u03bd = 0.9 , which accounts for random demand fluctuations. Thus, the minimal frequency f min,Y is (14) f m i n , Y ( n ) = \u03b1 Y \u03bd n k v . This approach can synthetically model every type of spatial demand distribution, centripetal or uniform. We refer to the literature review section in Moccia and Laporte (2016) for the relevance of this aspect. Hence, the single-period model can be stated as follows (15) maximize \u03d5 Y 2 2 e P y + Y P \u2212 C o , Y ( f , n , d ) (16) subject to d \u2265 d m i n (17) n \u2208 { n m i n , \u2026 , n m a x } (18) f m i n , Y ( n ) \u2264 f \u2264 f m a x (19) P \u2265 0 (20) Y = y ( 1 \u2212 e a t a ( d ) \u2212 e w t w ( f ) \u2212 e v t v , Y ( f , n , d ) \u2212 e P P ) . 2.2 Two-period model At peak and off-peak hours there are maximum demand levels yp and yo , respectively. The captured demand levels, Yp and Yo , are fractions of these maximum levels. We posit two frequencies for the two periods, namely fp for the peak, and fo for the off-peak period. The TU length for the peak period is np , and no denotes the TU length for the off-peak period. The stop spacing d does not vary between periods. We assume the same fare for both periods, but a time-dependent fare would be an interesting extension. It could lead to pricing schemes that reduce one of the main cost driver of a transit system, the ratio between peak and off-peak demand levels. However, this would require a model where passengers choose their trip time according to a variable fare. Our elastic demand model cannot answer such a question, but the multi-period fixed demand model of Moccia and Laporte (2016) can assess system cost variations under several demand profile scenarios. Analogously to the single-period model, the captured demand levels are functions of the travel time components and fare: (21) Y ( p , o ) ( f ( p , o ) , n ( p , o ) , d , P ) = y ( p , o ) ( 1 \u2212 e a t a ( d ) \u2212 e w t w ( f ( p , o ) ) \u2212 e v t v , Y ( p , o ) ( p , o ) ( f ( p , o ) , n ( p , o ) , d ) \u2212 e P P ) . The ratio of peak hours to total service hours is denoted by \u03c7p , and \u03c7 o = 1 \u2212 \u03c7 p is the ratio of off-peak hours to total service hours. For example, if the typical weekday service lasts 20 hours and the peak service is offered for five hours, then \u03c7 p = 0.25 . Using this notation, we can express the maximization of total welfare for the two-period model as follows: (22) maximize W = \u03d5 ( \u03c7 p Y p ( f p , n p , d , P ) 2 2 e P y p + \u03c7 o Y o ( f o , n o , d , P ) 2 2 e P y o ) + ( \u03c7 p Y p ( f p , n p , d , P ) + \u03c7 o Y o ( f o , n o , d , P ) ) P \u2212 C o , Y p , Y o ( f p , f o , n p , n o , d ) , where C o , Y p , Y o is the operator cost function for the demand levels Yp and Yo at peak and off-peak periods: (23) C o , Y p , Y o ( f p , f o , n p , n o , d ) = c 0 l + c 0 s 2 L d + c 1 v n p f p t c , Y p p ( f p , n p , d ) + c 1 t \u03c7 p f p t c , Y p p ( f p , n p , d ) + + c 1 t \u03c7 o f o t c , Y o o ( f o , n o , d ) + 2 c 2 v L ( \u03c7 p n p f p + \u03c7 o n o f o ) . The constraints of this optimization model are the elastic demand constraints (21), those that define feasible ranges for the frequencies, stop spacing, and TU lengths, as in the single-period model, and the following constraint that ensures that the largest fleet is deployed at the peak period: (24) n p f p t c , Y p p ( f p , n p , d ) \u2265 n o f o t c , Y o o ( f o , n o , d ) . 3 Analysis and solution methods We analyze the single-period model and devise a solution method for it in Section 3.1. These analytic results are further discussed in Section 3.2. The solution method for the single-period model is extended to the two-period model in Section 3.3. 3.1 Solving the single-period model First, as observed by Chang and Schonfeld (1991), consistency requires that the ratios of travel times to fare sensitivity parameters be equal to the values of time, for example e a / e P = P a , where Pa is the access and egress time value. We denote by Pw and Pv the values of the waiting and in-vehicle times, respectively. The following equations hold: (25) Y = y ( 1 \u2212 e a t a \u2212 e w t w \u2212 e v t v , Y \u2212 e P P ) = y ( 1 \u2212 e P ( e a e P t a + e w e P t w + e v e P t v , Y ) \u2212 e P P ) = y ( 1 \u2212 e P ( P a t a + P w t w + P v t v , Y ) \u2212 e P P ) . Second, we note that the factor P a t a + P w t w + P v t v , Y is the average passenger time value when the demand is equal to Y. We denote by C p,Y the time value of Y passengers using a transit system with average access and egress, waiting, and in-vehicle times equal to ta, tw , and t v, Y , respectively. Therefore, the elastic demand constraint (20) can be expressed as (26) Y ( f , n , d , P ) = y ( 1 \u2212 e P C p , Y ( f , n , d ) Y \u2212 e P P ) . Let \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] denote an auxiliary variable such that (26) can be replaced by { \u03bb = 1 \u2212 e P C p , y \u03bb ( f , n , d ) y \u03bb \u2212 e P P , Y = y \u03bb , 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1 . We can restate problem (15)\u2013(20) as (27) W * = max f , n , d , P , \u03bb \u03d5 y 2 e P \u03bb 2 + y \u03bb P \u2212 C o , y \u03bb ( f , n , d ) (28) subject to d \u2265 d m i n (29) n \u2208 { n m i n , \u2026 , n m a x } (30) f m i n , y \u03bb ( n ) \u2264 f \u2264 f m a x (31) 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1 (32) P \u2265 0 (33) \u03bb = 1 \u2212 e P C p , y \u03bb ( f , n , d ) y \u03bb \u2212 e P P , where the dependence on Y has been replaced by y\u03bb. We observe that Eq. (33) implies that any feasible fare P is such that P = 1 e P \u2212 C p , y \u03bb ( f , n , d ) y \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb e P . Hence, by getting rid of the dependence on P in problem (27)\u2013(33), and taking into account the fact that P \u2265 0, we obtain the following equivalent formulation: (34) W * = max f , n , d , \u03bb \u03d5 y 2 e P \u03bb 2 + y \u03bb ( 1 e P \u2212 C p , y \u03bb ( f , n , d ) y \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb e P ) \u2212 C o , y \u03bb ( f , n , d ) subject to (28)\u2013(31) (35) 1 e P \u2212 C p , y \u03bb ( f , n , d ) y \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb e P \u2265 0 . Now observe that the objective function in (34) can be rewritten as y \u03bb e P ( 1 + \u03d5 \u03bb 2 \u2212 \u03bb ) \u2212 C p , y \u03bb ( f , n , d ) \u2212 C o , y \u03bb ( f , n , d ) , where the first term depends on \u03bb only. By adopting the following more compact notation (36) C t o t , y \u03bb ( f , n , d ) \u225c C p , y \u03bb ( f , n , d ) + C o , y \u03bb ( f , n , d ) (37) C ( \u03bb ) \u225c y \u03bb e P ( 1 + \u03d5 \u03bb 2 \u2212 \u03bb ) , where we denote by C tot, y\u03bb the sum of passengers\u2019 time value and operator cost, at the demand level y\u03bb, the problem can be reformulated as (38) W * = max W ( \u03bb , f , n , d ) \u225c C ( \u03bb ) \u2212 C t o t , y \u03bb ( f , n , d ) subject to (28)\u2013(31) (39) C p , y \u03bb ( f , n , d ) \u2264 y e P \u03bb ( 1 \u2212 \u03bb ) . This equivalence is instrumental to the following three aims: (i) obtaining bounds; (ii) clarifying relationships on technology break-even points; (iii) specifying demand levels at the extremes of the elastic demand objective function, social welfare maximization and profit maximization. First, we observe that (38) has two components, a concave function C(\u03bb), and \u2212 C t o t , y \u03bb a strictly decreasing function with increasing demand. Hence, by elementary calculus, an upper bound \u03bb ^ on the optimal fraction of captured demand is computed as (40) \u03bb ^ = 1 2 \u2212 \u03d5 , and C ( \u03bb ^ ) is a straightforward upper bound on the optimal value of W. Second, we observe that since Moccia and Laporte (2016) provide a lower convex approximation scheme for the fixed demand case, we also have an upper approximation scheme for the objective function W at any given \u03bb. We can then easily compute an upper bound W ^ tighter than C ( \u03bb ^ ) by exploring \u03bb \u2208 [ 0 , \u03bb ^ ] with the approximation scheme of Moccia and Laporte (2016). This bounding scheme also computes a starting solution for the exploration of the domain [ 0 , \u03bb ^ ] described in the following. In order to develop a decomposition-based method, we introduce another auxiliary variable \u03b7 \u2208 [ 0 , \u03bb ^ ] that will allow to break the circularity deriving from constraint (39). Hence, we will next focus on the following reformulation of the problem (41) W * = max f , n , d , \u03bb , \u03b7 W ( f , n , d , \u03bb , \u03b7 ) \u225c C ( \u03bb ) \u2212 C t o t , y \u03b7 ( f , n , d ) subject to (28)\u2013(30) (42) 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 \u03bb ^ (43) C p , y \u03b7 ( f , n , d ) \u2264 y e P \u03bb ( 1 \u2212 \u03bb ) (44) 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 \u03bb ^ (45) \u03bb = \u03b7 . Now, we decompose the problem by successive separation on \u03b7 and \u03bb. In the following, by \u201c(M)\u201d we refer to the model and by \u201cW\u201d we refer to the objective function value of the model. We observe that problem (41)\u2013(45) can be rewritten as (M*) W * = max \u03b7 { W * ( \u03b7 ) : ( 44 ) } , where (M*(\u03b7)) W * ( \u03b7 ) = max \u03bb { W \u00af \u03b7 ( \u03bb ) : ( 42 ) , ( 45 ) } and, in turn (M*(\u03b7, \u03bb)) W \u00af \u03b7 ( \u03bb ) = max f , n , d { W ^ \u03b7 , \u03bb ( f , n , d ) : ( 28 ) \u2212 ( 30 ) , ( 43 ) } , where (46) W ^ \u03b7 , \u03bb ( f , n , d ) = C ( \u03bb ) \u2212 C t o t , y \u03b7 ( f , n , d ) . The latter equation implies that (M*(\u03b7, \u03bb)) can be rewritten as (M*(\u03b7, \u03bb)) W \u00af \u03b7 ( \u03bb ) = C ( \u03bb ) \u2212 C \u00af ( \u03b7 , \u03bb ) , where (47) C \u00af ( \u03b7 , \u03bb ) = min f , n , d { C t o t , y \u03b7 ( f , n , d ) : ( 28 ) \u2212 ( 30 ) , ( 43 ) } . Summarizing, taking into account the whole decomposition process, namely, problems (M*(\u03b7)) and (M*(\u03b7, \u03bb)), model (M*) becomes (48) W * = max \u03b7 \u2208 [ 0 , \u03bb ^ ] max \u03bb \u2208 [ 0 , \u03bb ^ ] , \u03bb = \u03b7 C ( \u03bb ) \u2212 min f , n , d C t o t , y \u03b7 ( f , n , d ) subject to (28)- (30), (43). We are now ready to propose an algorithmic approach for the solution of problem (M*) based on the decomposition presented in (48). We will make use of the following two relaxed problems ( M \u02dc (\u03b7, \u03bb)) W \u02dc ( \u03b7 , \u03bb ) = C ( \u03bb ) \u2212 min f , n , d { C t o t , y \u03b7 ( f , n , d ) : ( 28 ) \u2212 ( 30 ) } obtained from (M*(\u03b7, \u03bb)) by removing constraint (43), and ( M \u02dc (\u03b7)) W \u02dc ( \u03b7 ) = max f , n , d , \u03bb { C ( \u03bb ) \u2212 C t o t , y \u03b7 ( f , n , d ) : ( 28 ) \u2212 ( 30 ) , ( 42 ) , ( 43 ) } obtained from (M*(\u03b7)) by relaxing constraint (45), i.e., \u03bb = \u03b7 . Now, assume that at iteration i one is given \u03b7 i \u2208 [ 0 , \u03bb ^ ] , and let \u03bb \u02dc i = \u03b7 i . We observe that the inner minimization problem in ( M \u02dc ( \u03b7 , \u03bb ) ), for \u03b7 = \u03b7 i and \u03bb = \u03bb \u02dc i , has the same structure as the fixed-demand model introduced in Moccia and Laporte (2016). Hence, by applying the lower convex envelope scheme of these authors, it is possible to approximately solve ( M \u02dc ( \u03b7 , \u03bb ) ), obtaining the maximizer ( f \u02dc i , n \u02dc i , d \u02dc i ) , and the corresponding optimal value W \u02dc ( \u03b7 i , \u03bb \u02dc i ) . If ( f \u02dc i , n \u02dc i , d \u02dc i ) satisfies constraint (43), then an optimal solution for ( M * ( \u03b7 i , \u03bb \u02dc i ) ) has been found, which is feasible for (M*), and whose optimal value W \u00af \u03b7 i ( \u03bb \u02dc i ) possibly represents a new best objective value for (M*). Otherwise, if ( f \u02dc i , n \u02dc i , d \u02dc i ) does not satisfy (43), then consider the relaxed problem ( M \u02dc ( \u03b7 ) ) for \u03b7 = \u03b7 i , obtained from (M*(\u03b7)) by relaxing constraint (45). Adopting ( \u03bb \u02dc i , f \u02dc i , n \u02dc i , d \u02dc i ) as a starting point, an appropriate nonlinear solver can be launched to yield an optimal solution (\u03bbi, fi, ni, di ), and the corresponding optimal value W \u02dc ( \u03b7 i ) . If the solution (\u03bbi, fi, ni, di ) satisfies constraint (45), namely if \u03bb i = \u03b7 i , then an optimal solution for (M*(\u03b7i )) has been found, which is feasible for (M*), with optimal value W * ( \u03b7 i ) = C ( \u03bb i ) \u2212 C t o t , y \u03b7 i ( f i , n i , d i ) , returning a possible new best objective value for (M*). Otherwise, \u03bbi , possibly combined with \u03b7i , can be used to generate \u03b7 i + 1 and to reiterate the procedure from the beginning. The full procedure can then be embedded into an exploration scheme over the interval [ 0 , \u03bb ^ ] for variable \u03b7, in order to generate a new \u03b7 every time a feasible solution is found. The procedure is described in Algorithm 1 . 3.2 Analytic insights for the single-period model This section presents observations on the optimal design and operating policies in Section 3.2.1, on the break-even points between technologies in Section 3.2.2, on the captured demand levels in Section 3.2.3, and on the sensitivity to the fare elasticity in Section 3.2.4. 3.2.1 Optimal design and operating policies Our equivalence scheme (38) implies that the optimality conditions between fixed and elastic models are the same. For an immediate insight, this can be recognised by focusing on the optimality condition of the unconstrained case. Let x be the vector of the design variables, in our case x = ( f , n , d ) . Then, the following general optimality condition holds component-wise: (49) \u2202 W ( \u03bb , x ) \u2202 x = \u2202 C t o t , y \u03bb ( x ) \u2202 x = 0 . However, this result is not new. As discussed in the literature review, Daganzo (2012) proved that for an objective function, the sum of the consumer surplus and of the net benefit to the rest of society, the optimality conditions for the system design and control variables are the same for the elastic and fixed demand models. The only assumption used by Daganzo (2012) was that the demand model must be a surjective mapping. Our more restrictive assumption, a linear demand model, allows us to prove the equivalence of the objective function value between fixed and elastic demand models for any linear combination of the consumer surplus and of the operator profit. Thus, the equivalence scheme leads to expect frequencies under elastic demand similar to those under passengers\u2019 time value and operator cost minimization at the demand level equivalent to the captured demand. The same observation can be made for the stop spacing, and hence we conclude that both the optimal configuration and operating policies are similar in the fixed and in the elastic models at the demand level equivalent to the captured demand. We further remark that this equivalence is derived for an unconstrained case. We illustrate this equivalence for a constrained case in the numerical experiments of Section 4. 3.2.2 Break-even points between technologies Two technologies break even for a given model when their optimal objective function values are equal. For a fixed demand model two technologies break even at the demand level y\u03bb when the objective function C tot,y\u03bb returns the same optimal value for both of them. Our equivalence scheme (38) implies that if we can solve exactly the fixed and the elastic models, then the same break-even demand for the two technologies can be found. For approximate solution methods, as in our numerical experiments, the equivalence scheme suggests that the break-even demands returned by the algorithms are circa equal. 3.2.3 Captured demand levels We derive an approximation of the captured demand levels as a function of \u03d5. First observe that the objective function W can be rewritten as (50) W = \u03d5 y 2 e p ( 1 \u2212 e P C p , Y Y \u2212 e p P ) 2 + y ( 1 \u2212 e P C p , Y Y \u2212 e p P ) P \u2212 C o , Y . For an approximation, we assume that the terms C p,Y and C o,Y do not depend significantly on P, namely, that (51) \u2202 C p , Y / \u2202 P = \u2202 C o , Y / \u2202 P \u2248 0 . Thus, the objective function W is twice continuously differentiable with respect to P, and we have (52) \u2202 W \u2202 P = P y e P ( \u03d5 \u2212 2 ) + y ( 1 \u2212 e P C p , Y Y ) ( 1 \u2212 \u03d5 ) , (53) \u2202 2 W \u2202 P 2 = y e P ( \u03d5 \u2212 2 ) < 0 . We denote by P* the unique value of P that satisfies the necessary conditions for an unconstrained local maximum: (54) P * = ( 1 \u2212 e P C p , Y Y ) ( 1 \u2212 \u03d5 ) e P ( 2 \u2212 \u03d5 ) . If P* is feasible, by observing that 1 \u2212 e P C p , Y / Y is equal to \u03bb + e P P , we can express P* as a function of \u03bb: (55) P * = \u03bb e P ( 1 \u2212 \u03d5 ) . Hence, P* is the optimal fare under the assumption (51) and when it satisfies the other constraints. For \u03d5 = 1 , the previous formula returns P * = 0 , a classic result in the case of social welfare maximization, e.g. Chang and Schonfeld (1991), when the capacity constraint of the vehicles is not binding, and therefore the marginal operator cost of a passenger is zero. We observe that (51) also implies that for a small fare variation the passenger travel time variation is negligible. We denote by \u03bb \u00af * the proportion of the captured demand when the optimal fare is equal to P*. Combining Eqs. (54) and (55) yields (56) \u03bb \u00af * = 1 \u2212 e P C p , Y Y 2 \u2212 \u03d5 . The term C p,Y /Y is the unit passenger time value for a fixed demand Y. The unit passenger time value as a function of the demand level is U-shaped. At first, the passenger time value decreases because of the lower waiting time due to the higher frequencies induced by higher demand levels. Then, as the maximum frequency is approached, the optimal vehicle load factor increases, and thus the crowding cost penalty prevails, as shown for example in Fig. 10 of Moccia and Laporte (2016). The focus of this paper is on technology choice, and the demand range where a technology is competitive is, typically, where the passenger time value is non-increasing. Hence, we can conservatively assume it to be a constant and the following relation can be drawn for the two cases of profit maximization, \u03d5 = 0 , and social welfare maximization, \u03d5 = 1 , (57) \u03bb \u00af * | \u03d5 = 0 = 1 2 \u03bb \u00af * | \u03d5 = 1 . As a result, under the above assumptions, the proportion of captured demand under profit maximization is half of that under social welfare maximization. We note that other studies observed numerically this result (Kocur and Hendrickson, 1982; Chang and Schonfeld, 1991). What we add to the literature is an analytic derivation and a specification of the necessary condition, i.e. passenger time value non-increasing with the demand. In fact, this condition was satisfied by the models of Kocur and Hendrickson (1982), and Chang and Schonfeld (1991) where the Mohring effect is present. 3.2.4 Sensitivity to the fare elasticity The equivalence scheme (38) implies a property for the optimal \u03bb when the fare elasticity tends to zero. Observe that the objective function W can be twice differentiated with respect to \u03bb, and we have (58) \u2202 W \u2202 \u03bb = y e P ( \u03bb ( \u03d5 \u2212 2 ) + 1 ) \u2212 \u2202 C t o t , \u03bb y \u2202 \u03bb , (59) \u2202 2 W \u2202 \u03bb 2 = y e P ( \u03d5 \u2212 2 ) \u2212 \u2202 2 C t o t , \u03bb y \u2202 \u03bb 2 . The concavity of W with respect to \u03bb requires the prevalence of the negative term y ( \u03d5 \u2212 2 ) / e P in the second partial derivative of W, a condition that can often be assumed. Hence, the optimal unconstrained fraction of the captured demand \u03bb* is (60) \u03bb * = 1 \u2212 \u2202 C t o t , \u03bb y \u2202 \u03bb e P y 2 \u2212 \u03d5 , and its limit when the fare elasticity tends to zero is the previously derived upper bound (61) lim e P \u2192 0 \u03bb * = 1 2 \u2212 \u03d5 = \u03bb ^ . 3.3 Solving the two-period model The solution method for the single-period model can be generalized to the two-period model. A similar treatment leads to single out an auxiliary problem with fixed demand. In the following we detail the equivalence scheme for the two-period model. First, observe that in (22) the dependence on Y (p,o) can be replaced by y (p,o) \u03bb (p,o), where the \u03bb (p,o) are (62) \u03bb ( p , o ) = 1 \u2212 e P C p , y ( p , o ) \u03bb ( p , o ) ( f ( p , o ) , n ( p , o ) , d ) y ( p , o ) \u03bb ( p , o ) \u2212 e P P . This allows to write P alternatively as (63) P = 1 e P \u2212 C p , y ( p , o ) \u03bb ( p , o ) ( f ( p , o ) , n ( p , o ) , d ) y ( p , o ) \u03bb ( p , o ) \u2212 \u03bb ( p , o ) e P . By properly substituting the above equations for P in (22), and by introducing the following two definitions (64) C t o t , y p \u03bb p , y o \u03bb o ( f p , f o , n p , n o , d ) \u225c \u03c7 p C p , y p \u03bb p ( f p , n p , d ) + \u03c7 o C p , y o \u03bb o ( f o , n o , d ) + C o , y p \u03bb p , y o \u03bb o ( f p , f o , n p , n o , d ) (65) C ( \u03bb p , \u03bb o ) \u225c \u03c7 p y p \u03bb p e P ( 1 + \u03d5 \u03bb p 2 \u2212 \u03bb p ) + \u03c7 o y o \u03bb o e P ( 1 + \u03d5 \u03bb o 2 \u2212 \u03bb o ) , we obtain the equivalence scheme similar to that of the single-period case: (66) W * = max W ( \u03bb p , \u03bb o , f p , f o , n p , n o , d ) \u225c C ( \u03bb p , \u03bb o ) \u2212 C t o t , y p \u03bb p , y o \u03bb o ( f p , f o , n p , n o , d ) . Similarly to constraint (35) for the single-period model, the following two constraints must be satisfied: (67) 1 e P \u2212 C p , y ( p , o ) \u03bb ( p , o ) ( f ( p , o ) , n ( p , o ) , d ) y ( p , o ) \u03bb ( p , o ) \u2212 \u03bb ( p , o ) e P \u2265 0 . The solution method is therefore similar to that of the single-period model, the main difference being that the decomposition relies on two variables, namely \u03bbp for the peak period, and \u03bbo for the off-peak period. The computational experiments presented in the following section show the effectiveness of the auxiliary fixed demand model in solving the problem. Moreover, we numerically confirm for the two-period model the observations drawn for the single-period model with respect to the optimal configuration, operating policies, break-even point between technologies, and differences in the captured demand levels when \u03d5 varies. 4 Computational results This section is structured as follows. Section 4.1 describes the case study and Section 4.2 cautions the reader on the interpretation of our numerical results presented in Section 4.3. Section 4.4 discusses sensitivity to the fare elasticity. 4.1 Case study We use the same case study of Moccia and Laporte (2016) and Tirachini et al. (2010), where a bidirectional line of 20 km is patronized by passengers traveling on average 10 km per trip, and accessing the line by walking at a speed of 4 km/h. The critical load is equal to 35% of the total demand, i.e. \u03b1 = 0.35 . Four technologies are studied, namely buses in mixed traffic lanes (Bus), bus rapid transit (BRT), light rail transit (LRT), and heavy rail (HR). The demand is studied from 3000 to 60,000 pax/h with a step-size of 100 pax/h. The algorithm is implemented in Python 2.7 with the L-BFGS-B solver, a quasi-Newton code for bound-constrained optimization (Zhu et al., 1997). We refer to Section 4.1 of Moccia and Laporte (2016) for further details. The models introduced in the present paper require new parameters for the elastic demand function. We assume eP equal to 0.07, as in Tirachini et al. (2010), and Table 1 lists this set of parameters. We focus on the introduced two-period model and we compare the results with the fixed demand model of Moccia and Laporte (2016), in the following referred to as Model IV. In Model IV break-even point between BRT and LRT occurs at circa 13,000 pax/h, and that between LRT and HR occurs at circa 20,000 pax/h. 4.2 Caveat lector We report break-even points between technologies, but we emphasize that there are plausible scenarios and additional issues that could lead to different conclusions. In Moccia and Laporte (2016) the reader has been cautioned about some aspects inherent to the parameter set derived by Tirachini et al. (2010). Since this paper aims at establishing a comparison with previous results we must maintain this parameter set. For instance, the parameter set allows frequencies that could be infeasible because of stop capacity, or may be undesirable in many specific contexts. They could also induce negative externalities in terms of urban segregation. The vehicular and pedestrian traffic flows crossing the transit line would be hampered with high transit frequencies. We further observe that we are comparing technologies that may have significantly different pollution profiles both in terms of local air quality and global greenhouse gas emissions, noise levels, visual aesthetics, and degree of local manufacturing content, and that the model does not account for these aspects. We refer to Vuchic et al. (2012) for an extensive discussion of several transit planning issues, and to Vuchic (1984) on the limits of strictly economic appraisal in transportation. Moreover, economic appraisal can assess efficiency and effectiveness but does not address equity concerns (Perugia et al., 2011; Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2017). 4.3 Numerical results We first present results obtained with the maximization of social welfare, i.e. with \u03d5 = 1 , and then those with the maximization of profit, \u03d5 = 0 . In all cases the algorithm reaches a feasible solution. The starting point derived from the auxiliary fixed demand model is instrumental to this. We report that a random starting point would often converge to a \u03bb = 0 solution. Table 2 reports the median worst-case optimality gaps. Fig. 2 illustrates the optimal social welfare averaged with respect to the maximum peak demand. Break-even points appear larger than those of Model IV. However, when the optimal social welfare is scaled to the captured demand, as shown in Fig. 3 , the break-even points between technologies are very close to those of Model IV. Optimal peak frequency, stop spacing, and consist are depicted in Figs. 4 , 5 , and 6 , respectively. As expected, these results are very close to those of Model IV when scaling to the captured demand. The ratios of the captured demands to the maximum peak and off-peak demands are reported in Figs. 7 and 8 , respectively. The optimal fare is always equal to zero. We observe that the optimal stop spacing, Fig. 5, tends to slightly increase when the maximum frequency, Fig. 4, is reached. The resulting higher vehicle load ratios shift the balance between in-vehicle and access costs toward larger stop spacings. Note the different behavior of rail modes. For LRT, the stop spacing increase is followed by a reduction as soon as consist increases at 18,000 pax/h of potential peak demand, Fig. 6. For HR, the larger TU capacities allow stop spacing reduction with increasing demand across the whole range of studied demand. Fig. 9 illustrates the optimal profit averaged with respect to the maximum peak demand. Break-even points appear much larger than those of Model IV. This stems from the significantly lower captured demand under profit maximization. However, as in the case of social welfare maximization, scaling the optimal profit to the captured demand, as shown in Fig. 10 , leads to break-even points that are very close to those of Model IV. Optimal peak frequency, stop spacing, and consist are depicted in Figs. 11 , 12 , and 13 , respectively. Comparing Fig. 11 with Fig. 4 we observe that the optimal frequency is similar at the same demand level, the difference lying in the larger demand levels captured by social welfare maximization. The ratios of the captured demands to the maximum peak and off-peak demands are reported in Figs. 14 and 15 , respectively. As analytically observed in Section 3.2, these ratios are circa half of those yielded by social welfare maximization. Fig. 16 reports the optimal fare. 4.4 Sensitivity to the fare elasticity We now test the sensitivity to the fare elasticity parameter. We reduce this parameter by an order of magnitude, i.e. we set it equal to 0.007. The other elastic demand parameters are modified accordingly. In the profit maximization case, this very low sensitivity to fare yields higher proportions of captured demand than in the previous experiment. These proportions are close to 0.5 for all technologies, Figs. 17 and 18 . However, the same effect occurs in the social welfare maximization case where the proportions of captured demand are close to one for all technologies, Figs. 19 and 20 . These results confirm the analytic insight (61). We further report that the break-even points between technologies, the optimal configuration, and the operating policies do not change. Thus, we have confirmed numerically for the two-period model the analytic observation derived for the single-period model that the model results do not depend on the fare elasticity parameter. 5 Conclusions We have derived an equivalence scheme between fixed and elastic demand models for the single-period optimization of a transit line under the assumption that the elastic demand can be approximated by a linear function of fare and passenger travel time components. The maximization of a weighted sum of net passenger welfare and operator profit is equivalent to the minimization of the sum of passengers\u2019 time value and operator cost with fixed demand. The break-even points between technologies under elastic demand are similar to those under fixed demand when accounting for the effective demand captured. The approximated proportion of captured demand under profit maximization is circa half of that under social welfare maximization. These results do not depend on any specific assumption on the fare elasticity parameter, and are derived for a general setting where the passenger time value is not necessarily decreasing with higher demand levels. The equivalence scheme derived for the single-period model has been extended to the two-period model to obtain a solution algorithm. This algorithm always yields feasible solutions in our computational experiments, whereas a straightforward implementation would have failed. Finally, we have confirmed numerically that for the two-period model, the analytic observations drawn for the single-period model still hold. The relevance for the scientific literature and for the public transport practice is as follows. For the transportation literature, the equivalence scheme in the objective function reinforces the general result of the equivalence in the optimality conditions of Daganzo (2012). This motivates a productive decoupling between system design and demand forecast. Optimal transit configuration problems can be enriched by increasing the operational details while the demand forecast can be delegated to specialized pricing and policy setting models. To this aim, we plan to refine fixed demand transit models in future work. For the public transport practice, we highlight one of our findings, the large difference in captured demand, by a factor of two, between social welfare maximization and profit maximization under non-increasing passenger time value. This is very significant for the optimal configuration of transit systems where economies of scale exist both for the operator and the passenger. To the least, this result suggests fare subsidization for lower income passengers. Acknowledgments Luigi Moccia was partially supported by the CNR (Italy) under the STM-2015 grant.

Appendix A Notes on the comparison between fixed and elastic demand models Appendix A.1 Reconsidering a result of Chang and Schonfeld (1991) Our equivalence scheme is fairly general and can also be applied, by substituting the proper cost functions, to Chang and Schonfeld (1991) problem where a bus line branches from a line haul section to provide local service. The decision variables of Chang and Schonfeld (1991) are frequency and route spacing in the local service area. These authors derive exact formulae for the optimal solution of the fixed demand model (minimization of the total cost, sum of the passengers\u2019 value of time and the operator cost), and approximate formulae for the elastic demand models (maximization of the social welfare, and maximization of the operator profit). They consider both single- and multi-period models. For simplicity, in the following we only refer to the single-period models. Some of the findings of Chang and Schonfeld (1991) are similar to ours, namely a similarity in the ratio between design variables of the fixed and elastic demand models, and a factor of two between the captured demands of the two elastic demand objective functions. However, a discrepancy with our findings is that the optimality conditions for the design variables are in general different between fixed and elastic demands. These authors state, page 471: \u201cFor cost minimization at fixed demand the average operator cost, the user wait cost and the lateral component of user access cost (perpendicular to routes) are all exactly equal in an optimized system [...] This optimality condition [...] does not extend to elastic demand cases, in which average user wait cost is equal to average lateral access cost, but both are less than the average operator cost\u201d. And, on page 475: \u201cIn comparing the fixed demand results [...] we see that better service (e.g. lower headways), and hence lower user costs and higher operator costs are provided with equilibrium demand\u201d. To understand the source of this discrepancy we have implemented the formulae of Chang and Schonfeld (1991) with their data, and we have computed the results of Table A.3 . The first data column reports the results of the fixed demand model. Observe that these results are not immediately comparable to those of Table 3 of Chang and Schonfeld (1991) since we do not approximate the fleet size to an integer value. As will be explained later, since the approximations are the source of discrepancy between our and their results, we present continuous values of the fleet size as they are obtained by Chang and Schonfeld (1991) formulae. The second column reports the profit maximization yielded by the approximate formulae (41) and (42) of Chang and Schonfeld (1991). As discussed in their paper, the average user wait cost is less than the average operator cost. The third column reports the profit optimization obtained by a numerical solver directly applied to the profit objective function. Observe that the profit is only slightly larger than that provided by the approximate formulae, column (2), which highlights the quality of the approximations derived by these authors. However, the solution now displays an equality between average user wait cost and average operator cost, an optimality condition derived for the fixed demand. We now highlight the explanatory power of our equivalence scheme. Fig. A.21 depicts the profit as a function of the fraction of the captured demand. This figure is computed by our equivalence scheme, and the two components are C(\u03bb), Eq. (37) with \u03d5 = 0 , and \u2212 C t o t , \u03bb q * , the negative of the optimal total cost for the fixed demand \u03bbq, where q in the notation of Chang and Schonfeld (1991) is the potential demand, similar to the y of our model. The profit is concave in \u03bb because within the parameter set of Chang and Schonfeld (1991), the convexity of \u2212 C t o t , \u03bb q * does not overcome the prevalent concavity of C(\u03bb). Henceforth, the optimal \u03bb can be found by a direct search method. We have implemented a golden-section search which converges to the solution value presented in the fourth column of Table A.3. As expected by our equivalence scheme, this fixed demand solution is exactly the same as that of the elastic model, and a fixed point has been found. The last two rows of the fourth column report the values of C(\u03bb) that allow to verify the equivalence in the objective function value between elastic and fixed demands. These same findings can be observed for the social welfare maximization in the remaining columns of Table A.3 and in Fig. A.22 . Moreover, we recall our formula (37) for the optimal fare which in the case of profit maximization is P * = \u03bb / e P . The solution in the third column has a \u03bb value, the fraction of the captured demand with respect to the potential demand, equal to 24.6/67.8, and in these experiments e P = 0.07 . The optimal fare for profit maximization computed by the numerical solver is equal to that provided by our formula, P * = 24.6 / ( 67.8 \u00d7 0.07 ) = 5.18 . We further note that in the problem of Chang and Schonfeld (1991) the average passenger time value strictly decreases with increasing demand (Mohring effect), hence our result on the factor of two between the captured demands of the social welfare maximization and of the profit maximization holds. This fact was numerically observed by these authors, but our analytic derivation allows a further step. In Chang and Schonfeld (1991), the profit maximization approximate formulae for the design variables, (41) and (42), and for the fleet size (44), can be seen as a particular case of those for social welfare maximization, (51)\u2013(53), by replacing in the latter q by q/2. Appendix A.2 Reinterpreting a finding of Tirachini et al. (2010) A finding of Tirachini et al. (2010) can be reinterpreted through our results. In the models of Tirachini et al. (2010) the optimized variable is the frequency, and the optimal frequency under social welfare maximization is approximately 2 times larger than that under profit maximization. We observe that in Tirachini et al. (2010) fixed demand model the optimal frequency is the square root of the demand. The invariance of the optimality conditions between elastic and fixed demand models and the factor of two in captured demands between profit and social welfare maximizations explain this finding. Appendix B Notational glossary Table B.4 reports the primary symbols used in this paper. Some other symbols are derived from those listed in this table as explained in the following. The subscripts min and max specify bounds of a parameter or of a variable. A variable with the tilde symbol is related to an approximation scheme. The superscripts (p, o) refer to the peak or off-peak periods. The captured demand Y can be equivalently indicated as \u03bby. References Badia, Estrada, Robust\u00e9, 2014 H. Badia M. Estrada F.
