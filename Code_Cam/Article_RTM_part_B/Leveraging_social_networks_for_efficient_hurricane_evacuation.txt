"Transportation Research Part B: MethodologicalLeveraging social networks for efficient hurricane evacuationAbstract One of the important factors affecting evacuation performance is the departure time choices made by evacuees. Simultaneous departures of evacuees can lead to overloading of road networks causing congestion. We are especially interested in cases when evacuees subject to little or no risk of exposure evacuate along with evacuees subject to higher risk of threat (also known as shadow evacuation). One of the reasons for correlated evacuee departures is higher perceived risk of threat spread through social contacts. In this work, we study an evacuation scenario consisting of a high risk region and a surrounding low risk area. We propose a probabilistic evacuee departure time model incorporating both evacuee individual characteristics and the underlying evacuee social network. We find that the performance of an evacuation process can be improved by forcing a small subset of evacuees (inhibitors) in the low risk area to delay their departure. The performance of an evacuation is measured by both average travel time of the population and total evacuation time of the high risk evacuees. We derive closed form expressions for average travel time for ER random network. A detailed experimental analysis of various inhibitor selection strategies and their effectiveness on different social network topologies and risk distribution is performed. Results indicate that significant improvement in evacuation performance can be achieved in scenarios where evacuee social networks have short average path lengths and topologically influential evacuees do not belong to the high risk regions. Additionally, communities with stronger ties improve evacuation performance.serial JL 271728 291210 291772 291817 31 Transportation Research Part B: Methodological TRANSPORTATIONRESEARCHPARTBMETHODOLOGICAL 2015-04-29 2015-04-29 2015-05-18T18:23:27 1-s2.0-S0191261515000594 S0191-2615(15)00059-4 S0191261515000594 10.1016/j.trb.2015.03.016 S300 S300.1 FULL-TEXT 1-s2.0-S0191261515X00051 2015-05-18T14:49:05.359845-04:00 0 0 20150701 20150731 2015 2015-04-29T22:47:53.890642Z articleinfo articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright crossmark dateloaded dateloadedtxt datesearch datesort dateupdated dco docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid indexeddate issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdateend pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype ssids alllist content subj subheadings suppl tomb volfirst volissue volumelist webpdf webpdfpagecount yearnav figure table body mmlmath affil articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authkeywords authlast highlightsabst primabst ref 0191-2615 01912615 true 77 77 C Volume 77 12 199 212 199 212 201507 July 2015 2015-07-01 2015-07-31 2015 article fla Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract One of the important factors affecting evacuation performance is the departure time choices made by evacuees. Simultaneous departures of evacuees can lead to overloading of road networks causing congestion. We are especially interested in cases when evacuees subject to little or no risk of exposure evacuate along with evacuees subject to higher risk of threat (also known as shadow evacuation). One of the reasons for correlated evacuee departures is higher perceived risk of threat spread through social contacts. In this work, we study an evacuation scenario consisting of a high risk region and a surrounding low risk area. We propose a probabilistic evacuee departure time model incorporating both evacuee individual characteristics and the underlying evacuee social network. We find that the performance of an evacuation process can be improved by forcing a small subset of evacuees (inhibitors) in the low risk area to delay their departure. The performance of an evacuation is measured by both average travel time of the population and total evacuation time of the high risk evacuees. We derive closed form expressions for average travel time for ER random network. A detailed experimental analysis of various inhibitor selection strategies and their effectiveness on different social network topologies and risk distribution is performed. Results indicate that significant improvement in evacuation performance can be achieved in scenarios where evacuee social networks have short average path lengths and topologically influential evacuees do not belong to the high risk regions. Additionally, communities with stronger ties improve evacuation performance. Keywords Evacuation Congestion Social networks Diffusion Shadow evacuation Departure time choice Models 1 Introduction An efficient evacuation of people from a source of threat to a safer destination is critical to prevent loss of life and property. Inefficiency in evacuation is caused due to the inability of the surface transportation network to handle a large evacuating population. Transportation networks are built to meet daily demands of the population and often lead to heavy congestion when subjected to a sudden surge in demand. Congestion effects are further exaggerated as a result of decisions made by evacuees (e.g., overlapping route choices and/or near simultaneous departure times). Therefore, evacuee decision making plays a major role in improving the efficacy of an evacuation process. Some of the typical decisions made by evacuees are: to evacuate or to stay, when to evacuate, where to evacuate to, and which route to take (Alsnih and Stopher, 2004). Among all of the above mentioned decisions, improving performance by optimizing evacuee route choices is a well researched problem (Hamacher and Tjandra, 2002; Peeta, 1995; Peeta and Ziliaskopoulos, 2001; Kim et al., 2008; Mahamassani, 2001; Madireddy et al., 2011). In this paper we investigate the effect of evacuee departure time choice on evacuation performance. The timing of evacuee departure is critical because the number of evacuations per unit time (also referred to as loading rate) can result in overloading of the transportation network, thereby impeding evacuation (Dow and Cutter, 2002; Wolshon et al., 2005; FEMA, 2012). In any evacuation scenario, there is a region exposed to high risk of threat and a surrounding regions with relatively low exposure to threat. The high risk evacuees are typically issued mandatory evacuation orders. On the other hand, the low risk evacuees are in no immediate danger and should only evacuate when issued mandatory orders. But, in several actual evacuations, it has been observed that large number of evacuees in low risk areas evacuate along with evacuees from high risk areas. Such a phenomenon is often referred to as shadow evacuation (Yazici and Ozbay, 2008). Shadow evacuations result in longer clearance time for evacuees in high risk region. Shadow evacuation has been reported as a major impediment during hurricanes (Rita, Ike, Floyd) (Bugliarello, 2006; ScienceDaily, 2009), nuclear accidents or chemical spills (Chernobyl, Grianteville) (Donn, 2013; Mitchell et al., 2007). Shadow evacuations are more pronounced in rapid onset threat situations like chemical spills (Mitchell et al., 2007). Fig. 1 (a) illustrates a hypothetical evacuation scenario with high and low risk regions. The dotted curve in Fig. 1(b) indicates the loading rate when both high and low risk evacuees evacuate nearly simultaneously. The resulting evacuation is inefficient as the loading rate exceeds the capacity of the road network (horizontal line). Ideally, one would prefer high risk evacuees to evacuate before the rest of the population, as illustrated by the solid curve. One of the reasons for observing shadow evacuations is higher perceived risk by evacuees due to social influence. Social influence is a key factor in many socio-psychological processes similar to evacuation (Perry et al., 1981; Riad et al., 1999; Lindell et al., 2008; Hui et al., 2010), such as spread of disease, rumor and innovation. Social influence in disease spread is modeled using Susceptible\u2013Infective\u2013Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible\u2013Infective\u2013Susceptible (SIS) models (Pastor-satorras and Vespignani, 2008; Boccaletti et al., 2006; Mahajan and Muller, 1990), rumor spread using Daley and Kendall (DK), Maki and Thompson (MT) (Daley and Kendall, 1965; Maki and Thompson, 1973; Nekovee et al., 2008) and innovation using threshold, cascade and voters models (Granovetter, 1978; Holtz, 2004; Even-dar and Shapira, 2007). In spite of the qualitative insights from many social science studies, evacuation models with social influences are currently lacking (Clifford, 1956; Dash and Gladwin, 2008; Gladwin et al., 2007; Quarantelli, 1985); further, only a few studies explicitly model the evacuee decision making process (Hasan and Ukkusuri, 2011; Hui et al., 2010; Widener et al., 2012). In this work we present an individual level evacuation loading model along with a control strategy leveraging on social influence between evacuees to improve evacuation performance. We measure the performance of an evacuation process by (1) the total time required to evacuate evacuees in high risk region and (2) average travel time of the entire population. The total evacuation time is especially critical for evacuees in high-risk region as it may directly translate into loss of life. On the other hand, average travel time measures the time spent by each evacuee on the road. Higher average travel time signifies the inconvenience experienced by evacuees during travel and therefore is an important performance measure. The objective of this current work is two fold: (a) study the effect of social network structure on evacuation performance and (b) improve evacuation performance by modifying social influence structure. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: we discuss the evacuee departure time choice model in Section 2 and control strategies in Section 3. Section 4 provides analytical insights into the evacuee decision making process. In Sections 5 and 6 we present experimental results and conclusions respectively. 2 Departure time choice model Consider a community of evacuee households which are connected through an underlying social network G ( V , E ) where V is the set of all evacuee households and E is the set of all pairs of contacts. We divide the evacuee population into high ( V H ) and low risk ( V L ) groups based on their risk of exposure. Each evacuee is associated with a risk level whose value depends on whether evacuee belongs to high risk region or low risk region. An evacuee v\u2019s risk level \u220a v is defined as (1) \u220a v = \u220a H v \u2208 V H \u220a L v \u2208 V L where \u220a H , \u220a L \u2208 ( 0 , 1 ] are the risk levels associated with high risk and low risk areas. The risk levels are determined mainly by threat characteristics (category, trajectory, wind speed, level, exclusion zone) and population densities (Chen and Zhan, 2006; Fu et al., 2007; Ozbay and Yazici, 2006; Gladwin et al., 2007; Hasan and Ukkusuri, 2011). Note that in general each evacuee can have an individual risk level depending on the type of housing (e.g., single-family dwelling, multiple-family dwelling, mobile homes), ability to drive and other personal factors. Typically, risk level is much higher in the high risk region i.e. \u220a H \u226b \u220a L . In this work, we assume all the evacuees are exposed to some degree of risk i.e. \u220a L > 0 . The state of evacuation process on underlying social network G is modeled as a binary random vector X ( t ) = [ X v ( t ) ] v \u2208 V of size | V | where random variable X v ( t ) is the state of an evacuee v at time t, defined as (2) X v ( t ) = 1 if evacuee v has evacuated before time t 0 otherwise Evacuation is an irreversible monotone process i.e., once an evacuee evacuates they remain evacuated. Each individual evacuee in our model can be in one of the two states: evacuated or non-evacuated. Let X ( t ) = x be the current state of the evacuation process and e v be a unit vector of dimension | V | having a 1 at the index of vertex v. We define the rate of transition of node v to evacuated state by a rate function, Q : S \u00d7 S \u2192 R , as Q ( x , x + e v ) . For simplicity we will represent it as Q v ( x ) (3) Q v ( x ) = \u2211 u \u2208 N v \u03bb u , v x u + \u220a v x v = 0 0 x v = 1 where \u03bb u , v \u2208 [ 0 , 1 ] is the influence exerted by evacuee u on v. A higher level of risk indicates evacuees are more likely to evacuate on their own without any external influence. We also assume that the rate of evacuation depends only on the current state of the system and is independent of time elapsed. To better understand the evacuation dynamics, one can define an exit rate function Q ( x ) = \u2211 v \u2208 V Q v ( x ) which determines the rate at which the process leaves state x . In fact, the overall evacuation process can be understood in two steps \u2022 Given the process is in state x , the time before the next evacuation is an exponentially distributed random variable, \u03c4 x , with parameter Q ( x ) i.e. (4) P ( \u03c4 x > t ) = e - Q ( x ) t \u2022 After \u03c4 x time, the probability that an unevacuated node v evacuates is given by Q v ( x ) Q ( x ) . We discuss three important aspects of our proposed model and compare them to existing influence spread models. \u2022 Individual characteristics: Evacuee individual characteristics play a major role in evacuee decision making process. Whereas, the above mentioned SIR, SIS, DK, MT, cascade and voters models neglect individual node attributes (Widener et al., 2012). Threshold models are the exception, where each node has its own threshold for evacuation. Early evacuee loading models estimated the loading rate based on the population in the threat region and daily highway network traffic (Johnson and Zeigler, 1986; Hobeika and Kim, 1998). These models failed to account for individual evacuee characteristics such as prior perception of personal risk, type of housing (e.g., single-family dwelling, multiple-family dwelling, mobile homes), and hazard specific threat factors (Baker, 1991). During the 1980s, a large number of post-hurricane surveys and behavioral studies were conducted leading to a new class of demand generation models that incorporated the previously mentioned evacuee characteristics (Perry et al., 1981; Prater et al., 2000; Ozbay and Yazici, 2006; Baker, 1991). These models were either very simplistic like sigmoid curves (S-curves) and Tweedie distribution, or data intensive and complex like logistic regression, artificial neural network (ANN), sequential logit model (SLM) and empirically based large-scale evacuation time estimate model (EMBLEM) (Lindell et al., 2007; Yazici and Ozbay, 2008; Lindell et al., 2008). Yet, none of the prior mentioned evacuee loading models account for evacuees at an individual level. The primary advantage of individual level loading models is that they enable us to incorporate social influence at a disaggregate scale in addition to individual evacuee characteristics. Additionally, individual level models provide us with a better understanding of the interactions between the underlying factors (like social influence and evacuee characteristics) and consequently, their impact on evacuation performance. \u2022 Social influence: Due to social influence, an evacuee is also more likely to evacuate as more of its neighbors evacuate. The positive dependence of evacuation decision on neighbors has been validated through a survey conducted on residents in North Carolina after hurricane Isabel and South Carolina after chemical spill (Horney et al., 2005; Mitchell and Radwan, 2006). Another property of our model is that the probability of influence exerted by a neighbor u on node v has a diminishing returns property in the number of evacuated neighbors. In other words, the marginal increase in probability of a node evacuating will be highest when its first neighbor evacuates and this increase will be smaller with additional neighbors evacuating. Such a marginal decreasing property of influence has been reported earlier in the case of memberships in online communities (Backstrom et al., 2006). In the threshold model, influence is modeled as a step function. Moreover, in threshold models, decision to evacuate depends on the fraction of evacuated neighbors indicating the higher degree nodes are less likely to evacuate as compared to our proposed model. Voters model assumes a linear influence function. \u2022 Complete evacuation: In our analysis, complete evacuation is a useful property as we are comparing average travel times on different network topologies. Our evacuee decision making process can be interpreted as a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC), as the current state of the system only depends on its previous state. The state space of CTMC consists of all possible binary vectors of length | V | . It follows that there are 2 | V | states. The evacuation process starts in state x o = 0 (no nodes evacuated) and ends in the terminal/absorbing state x f = 1 (all nodes evacuated). Moreover, there is a positive probability of reaching the absorbing state from any intermediate state. Therefore we can guarantee the convergence of the markov chain i.e., all evacuees will evacuate in finite time. Note that both the threshold and cascade models cannot guarantee complete evacuation. Akin to Vickery\u2019s bottleneck model (Bergstrom, 2012), suppose the geography of the source is such that all evacuees have to pass over a bridge with an inflow rate of C nodes per unit time. The bridge acts as a bottleneck causing congestion which leads to inflated travel times. The effect of road capacity and traffic volume on travel time delays can be captured using a single server queuing model. The arrivals into the queue are a result of the evacuation process. Let A i be the time of i th arrival onto the bridge. As the queue has a constant service rate of C nodes per unit time, the corresponding departure time D i can be computed using the following relationship, (5) D i = max ( A i , D i - 1 ) + 1 / C The travel time experienced by i th arrival is D i - A i . Therefore, the average travel time of the entire population is given by (6) TT ( G ) = 1 | V | \u2211 i = 1 | V | ( D i - A i ) The total evacuation time (TET) or clearance time of the risk region is given by (7) TET ( G ) = max z i \u2208 V H D i where z i is the evacuee corresponding to the i th arrival. We aim to study the effect of network topology and individual characteristics on both TT ( G ) and TET ( G ) . 3 An approach to controlling evacuation loading rate In order to improve the performance of an evacuation process, we propose to externally influence a subset of evacuees such that they do not evacuate until all other nodes have evacuated. We refer to such nodes as inhibitors ( I \u2286 V ) as they would inhibit other evacuees from departing simultaneously. In other words, inhibitor nodes aim at spreading evacuee departures over time. The concept of leveraging the influence of a subset of nodes in a population to modify the behavior of the entire population has been researched in fields such as marketing and epidemiology (Domingos and Richardson, 2001; Kempe et al., 2003; Pastor-satorras and Vespignani, 2008). For example, identifying a set of key nodes to give incentives (vaccines) in order to maximize the number of product users (minimize the number of infected people). In the area of evacuation, some researchers have proposed a methodology that can identify the initial seed node which will help in maximizing the spread of evacuation warning (Hui et al., 2010; Hasan and Ukkusuri, 2011). In contrast, we view inhibitors as barriers restricting the flow of influence from evacuated to non-evacuated population. The behavior of inhibitors is similar to that of recovered nodes in SIR models and stifler nodes in rumor spreading model as these classes of nodes prevent spreading. Recovered and stifler nodes are generated dynamically due to node interactions whereas inhibitors are set initially by external agents. In real world settings, it is difficult to prevent evacuees from evacuating. However, a recent study (Horney et al., 2005) indicates that members of certain civic groups (e.g., churches, American Legion) exhibit altruistic behavior as they volunteer to help their local communities. Our analysis can help authorities identify and persuade key individuals to act as inhibitors and improve the performance of the overall evacuation process. As inhibitors do not evacuate until all other nodes have evacuated, introducing inhibitors is equivalent to modifying the original social network G ( V , E ) by removing all inhibitor nodes and their attached edges. It can be easily verified that the modification in topology will not affect the dynamics as the inhibitors cannot be affected nor can they affect any other nodes in the social network similar to recovered and stifler nodes. Let G I ( V I \u2032 , E I ) be the modified graph where the vertex set V I \u2032 = V \u29f9 I and edge set E I = { ( v , u ) : ( v , u ) \u2208 E , v \u2208 V I \u2032 , u \u2208 V I \u2032 } . However, there is an inherent risk involved in introducing inhibitors. The fact that inhibitors will delay their evacuation implies that they will be exposed to threat for longer periods of time. We naturally would want to select inhibitors from the low risk region. One can pose the optimal inhibitor selection as the solution of the following optimization problems (8) min I \u2286 V L : | I | \u2a7d I max TT ( G I ) (9) min I \u2286 V L : | I | \u2a7d I max TET ( G I ) where I max is the maximum number of inhibitors. In the following section we show that for some special cases one can derive a closed form expression which captures the dependence of average travel time on the inhibitors. In general, however it appears quite difficult to get a closed form dependence expression. A straight forward approach would be to simulate the evacuation process for various choices of inhibitors. This would cause the number of inhibitor choices to increase rapidly with network size, and the simulation based approach can be prohibitively expensive. Even a simple gradient descent algorithm would required I max ( | V | - 0.5 I max ) simulation runs. A more complicated heuristic (like genetic algorithm or simulated annealing) will be even more computationally cumbersome. As an alternative, we propose a computationally cheaper heuristic for inhibitor selection. In order to restrict the flow of influence from evacuated to non-evacuated nodes, it is natural to set inhibitors to be the most influential or central nodes of the network. We simply select the top I max evacuees based on their centrality with respect to social graph G (see Algorithm 1). Algorithm 1 Centrality heuristic for inhibitor selection Input: G ( V , E ) , \u220a \u2217 , I max and node based measure \u0393 ( v ) \u2200 v \u2208 V Output: Inhibitor set, I Sort vertices in V L ( \u220a \u2217 ) in decreasing order of \u0393 ( v ) Set I to be the top I max vertices of sorted V ( \u220a \u2217 ) There are several centrality measures used to identify the influence of a node on the network. We use two of the most popularly used centrality measures: \u2022 Degree centrality of a vertex v in a network is the number of its neighbors deg v = | N v | . This is a local measure of immediate influence. It is a simple measure but often proves to be very effective. \u2022 Betweenness centrality of a vertex v is defined as the fraction of shortest distance paths that pass through it, bc v = \u2211 i , j \u2208 V , v \u2260 i , j , i \u2260 j \u03c3 i , j ( v ) \u03c3 i , j where \u03c3 i , j is the total number of shortest paths between nodes i and j and \u03c3 i , j ( v ) is the number of shortest paths between nodes i and j which go through v. A node with high betweenness centrality has a substantial influence on the network because it lies on the path that connects several pairs of nodes. Betweenness centrality is computationally expensive ( O ( | V | | E | ) for undirected graphs), but it is a one time computation. We can further extend the definitions of degree, betweenness centrality and local safety to weighted graphs. In the case of weighted networks, weighted degree centrality of a vertex v is defined as the total strength of all edges connected to it i.e. deg v w = \u2211 u \u2208 N v \u03bb uv . Similarly, weighted betweenness centrality ( bc v w ) of a vertex v in a weighted network is defined as the fraction of shortest weighted distance paths that pass through v on a graph G = ( V , E ) with modified weights \u03bb \u00af uv = \u03bb uv - 1 \u2200 ( u , v ) \u2208 E . This modification ensures that the shortest weighted paths contain higher strength links. Both the weighted centrality measures reduce to their unweighted counterparts when \u03bb uv = 1 \u2200 ( u , v ) \u2208 E . The weighted local safety measure is the weighted sum of neighborhood safety \u03c9 v w = \u2211 u \u2208 N v \u03bb u , v ( 1 - \u220a v ) . The effectiveness of the above mentioned inhibitor strategies on several weighted and unweighted networks are tested in Section 5. 4 Mean field analysis of evacuee loading model In this section, we provide analytical estimates of the performance of evacuation process using mean field analysis. The central idea of mean field analysis is that the dynamics of a probabilistic system with large number of interacting entities can be approximated by a deterministic function (Bortolussi et al., 2013). The fluctuations caused by each individual\u2019s random decision making cancels out and results in an approximately deterministic system. An important mean field assumption is that all evacuees are identical and indistinguishable. Such an assumption holds true for Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi (ER) random graphs as any pair of vertices are equally likely to be connected. Note that the mean field assumption will not hold true for networks where the probability of an edge between any two vertices is not equally likely (e.g., scale free networks, small world networks). Let G ( V , E ) be an ER random graph where each vertex has an average of k \u00af neighbors, \u03bb uv = \u03bb , \u2200 ( u , v ) \u2208 E and \u220a v = \u220a , \u2200 v \u2208 V . Due to homogeneity, we only have to keep track of total number of evacuees in a particular state rather than the state of each agent. In our case, we only have to keep track of the total number of evacuated evacuees at any time t , Y ( t ) = \u2211 v \u2208 V X v ( t ) . It follows that each unevacuated node has the same number of evacuated nodes ( = k \u00af Y \u02c6 ( t ) ) in their neighborhood where Y \u02c6 ( t ) = | V | - 1 Y ( t ) is the fraction of the evacuated population at time t. Therefore, the probability that one unevacuated node evacuates in time interval [ t , t + \u0394 T ] is ( \u03bb k \u00af Y \u02c6 ( t ) + \u220a ) \u0394 T (from Eq. (3)). The total number of evacuations in [ t , t + \u0394 T ] , is a binomial random variable B ( | V | - Y ( t ) , ( \u03bb k \u00af Y \u02c6 ( t ) + \u220a ) \u0394 T ) . Here B ( n , p ) refers to the number of successful evacuations observed from a total of n evacuees each having an evacuation probability of p. The dynamics of the evacuation process is given by the following probabilistic rule (10) Y ( t + \u0394 T ) = Y ( t ) + B ( | V | - Y ( t ) , ( \u03bb k \u00af Y \u02c6 ( t ) + \u220a ) \u0394 T ) , Y ( 0 ) = 0 . Boudec et al. (2007) have shown that the fraction of evacuated evacuees, Y \u02c6 ( t ) , which evolves based on a probabilistic rule, Eq. (10), can be approximated by a deterministic rule as the system size (i.e. | V | ) tends to infinity. Specifically, Theorem 1 states that our probabilistic loading model can be approximated by y \u02c6 ( t ) as defined in Eq. (11). Theorem 1 Boudec et al. (2007) Let Y \u02c6 ( t ) be the fraction of evacuated evacuees at time t. Then, for any finite time t, almost surely lim | V | \u2192 \u221e Y \u02c6 ( t ) = y \u02c6 ( t ) where (11) y \u02c6 \u0307 ( t ) = ( 1 - y \u02c6 ( t ) ) ( \u03bb k \u00af y \u02c6 ( t ) + \u220a ) , y \u02c6 ( 0 ) = 0 . As the system size grows, the law of large numbers dictates that random variables Y \u02c6 ( t ) \u2192 y \u02c6 ( t ) and B ( | V | - Y ( t ) , ( \u03bb k \u00af Y \u02c6 ( t ) + \u220a ) \u0394 T ) \u2192 ( | V | - Y ( t ) ) ( \u03bb k \u00af Y \u02c6 ( t ) + \u220a ) \u0394 T . The proof of Theorem 1 applies this convergence result inductively for each time step and shrinks \u0394 T \u2192 0 . By solving Eq. (11), we get (12) y \u02c6 ( t ) = 1 - \u03bb k \u00af + \u220a \u03bb k \u00af + \u220a e ( \u03bb k \u00af + \u220a ) t In order to compute the average wait time, we first define L ( t ) to be the queue length at time t. Note that queue starts forming only when the rate of arrival exceeds the capacity i.e. | V | y \u02c6 \u0307 ( t ) \u2a7e C . From Eq. (11) (assuming C is sufficiently small to enable queue formation), it is clear that there exists [ T 0 , T 1 ] such that y \u02c6 \u0307 ( t ) \u2a7e C if and only if t \u2208 [ T 0 , T 1 ] where T 0 and T 1 correspond to the two real roots of the quadratic equation | V | y \u02c6 \u0307 = C . Therefore, the queue starts forming at T 0 and reaches it maximum length at time T 1 . The queue length starts decreasing from T 1 and eventually vanishes at some time T 2 \u2a7e T 1 where T 2 > T 0 and satisfies the following relationship y ( T 2 ) - y ( T 0 ) = C ( T 2 - T 0 ) . In other words, the queue length L ( t ) can be defined as L ( t ) = y ( t ) - y ( T 0 ) - C ( t - T 0 ) \u2200 t \u2208 [ T 0 , T 2 ] We approximate the average wait time W \u00af experienced by all evacuees can be computed using the Little\u2019s law which states that the average wait time is the ratio of average queue length and average arrival rate i.e. W \u00af = \u222b T 0 T 2 L ( t ) dt | V | = \u222b T 0 T 2 y \u02c6 ( t ) - y \u02c6 ( T 0 ) - C | V | ( t - T 0 ) dt Solving the above integral, we get W \u00af = 1 \u03bb k \u00af ln \u03bb k \u00af + \u220a e ( \u03bb k \u00af + \u220a ) T 2 \u03bb k \u00af + \u220a e ( \u03bb k \u00af + \u220a ) T 0 - ( T 2 - T 0 ) \u220a \u03bb k \u00af + y \u02c6 ( T 0 ) + y \u02c6 ( T 2 ) 2 We can further assume that the population size ( | V | ) is much larger than the capacity of the bridge (C) which implies that queue starts forming at the beginning of the evacuation and ends when the last evacuee evacuates i.e. T 0 \u2248 0 , T 2 \u2248 | V | C , y \u02c6 ( T 0 ) \u2248 0 and y \u02c6 ( T 2 ) \u2248 1 . Under the simplifying assumptions, average wait time can be approximated as W \u00af \u2248 | V | 2 C - ln 1 + \u03bb k \u00af \u220a \u03bb k \u00af Average travel time can be represented as follows: TT ( G ) \u2248 | V | 2 C - ln 1 + \u03bb k \u00af \u220a \u03bb k \u00af + 1 C We now try to understand the relationship between average evacuee travel time and the number of inhibitors. Let I \u2286 V be the set of inhibitors. As discussed in Section 3, one can remove all edges associated with the inhibitors and analyze the dynamics on the resulting graph G I . In the case of random graphs, we can approximate the average degree of the G I , k \u00af I , to linearly decrease with the number of inhibitors. k \u00af I = k \u00af 1 - | I | | V | It follows that the average travel time on G I can be updated as follows (13) TT ( G I ) = | V I | 2 C - ln 1 + \u03bb k I \u00af \u220a \u03bb k I \u00af + 1 C In Fig. 2 , we compare our analytical estimate of expected travel time to the estimate obtained via numerical simulation. Also, we find that travel time decreases as we increase the number of inhibitors. This observation can be analytically confirmed by computing the differential of W \u00af ( G I ) with respect to | I | . d TT ( G I ) d | I | = - 1 C + 1 V I 1 \u220a + \u03bb k I \u00af + TT ( G I ) For d TT ( G I ) d | I | \u2a7d 0 , we need to show that (14) TT ( G I ) \u2a7d V I C - 1 \u220a + \u03bb k I \u00af . As ln ( 1 + z ) \u2a7e 1 2 z z + 1 , it follows that ln 1 + \u03bb k I \u00af \u220a \u2a7e 1 2 \u03bb k I \u00af \u220a + \u03bb k I \u00af \u21d2 TT ( G I ) \u2a7d 1 2 | V I | C - 1 ( \u220a + \u03bb k I \u00af ) [ From Eq . ( 13 ) ] Clearly, the inequality in Eq. (14) holds which means that the average travel time must decrease with the number of inhibitors. 5 Experimentation and results We perform simulations to obtain insights into the dependence of performance of evacuation process on social network topology, number of inhibitors, inhibitor selection strategy and risk distribution. All the experiments are performed on artificially generated random graphs with 1000 nodes and 5000 edges. We test our evacuee departure time model on five types of network topologies: ER random, lattice, small world, scale free and LFR networks (illustrated in Fig. 3 ). ER random networks are generated by placing | E | edges between randomly selected pairs of nodes. As a result, node degrees are homogeneous and follow a poisson distribution with a mean of 2 | E | | V | . They have small average path lengths due to the existence of shortcuts or bridges in the network. On the other extreme is a regular lattice network. Lattice networks are completely ordered networks (e.g., spatial) with each node connected to k of its nearest neighbors, and have high average path lengths as there are no bridge edges connecting distant nodes. In between these two extremes lie the small world networks which can be obtained by randomly rewiring edges of a lattice network with a re-wiring probability of \u03c1 . As \u03c1 tends to 1, small world networks converge to ER random graphs. Also, as \u03c1 increases average path length decreases due to formation of shortcuts. Note that all the three above mentioned networks (ER random, lattice and small world) have homogeneous degree distributions. Scale free networks have been proposed to generate topologies with heterogeneous degree distributions. Scale free networks are generated by preferentially attaching new nodes to high degree nodes, which in turn results in the formation of few high degree nodes (hubs) and a large number of small degree nodes. These networks have a low average path length due to the presence of hubs. The prior discussed network models fail to address another commonly observed property of several real world social networks: existence of subgroups/clusters. Clusters are formed such that more edges lie within them as compared to between clusters. LFR networks have been proposed to address this issue. These networks are generated based on number of nodes, mean degree ( \u3008 k \u3009 ), range of cluster size ( s min , s max ) and a noise parameter ( \u03bc ). The noise parameter determines the fraction of edges between clusters (Lancichinetti et al., 2008). For our experimentation we used LFR networks with parameters \u03bc , s min , s max = ( 0.1 , 5 , 10 ) . For all network topologies we consider various scenarios where the evacuation region is divided into two regions: high risk ( \u220a H = 1.0 ) and low risk ( \u220a L = 0.001 ) . We assume there are twice as many low risk evacuees as compared to high risk evacuees i.e. | V L | = 2 | V H | . For random, small world and lattice graphs, the high risk evacuees are chosen randomly. For scale free and LFR topologies, we consider two scenarios where high risk evacuees are (a) highly influential (high degree) and (b) non-influential (low degree). For LFR network, we test an additional scenario where evacuees belonging to the same community are subjected to high risk. In summary we have eight scenarios: (1) Random (2) Small World (3) Lattice (4) ScaleFree (Influential) (5) ScaleFree (Non-Influential) (6) LFR (Influential) (7) LFR (Non-Influential), and (8) LFR (Community). We test random and centrality based inhibitor selection strategies on all the scenarios. Given the stochastic nature of graph generation and evacuee dynamics, experiments are replicated \u03b7 g \u03b7 d times where \u03b7 g is the number of graph realizations and \u03b7 d is the number of diffusion model replications. For our experimentation \u03b7 g and \u03b7 d are set to 15, except for random inhibitor selection strategy in which case \u03b7 d is 25. The capacity, C, is always set to 50. 5.1 Effect of evacuee social network topology The social network of evacuees plays an important role during evacuation as it acts as a medium for the spread of influence between evacuees. Similar observation is true for all network topologies and has been validated by several empirical studies (Lindell et al., 2008; Ozbay and Yazici, 2006). The peak nature of the loading curve occurs when large groups of evacuees decide to leave nearly simultaneously. Simultaneous departures occur due to short paths of influence from evacuated nodes to non-evacuated nodes. One can capture the existence of short paths by measuring the average path length of the network. Therefore, we conjecture that short average path lengths of a network can result in longer travel times. We examine our hypothesis by recording travel times on several network topologies with varying path lengths. For this analysis we set all \u220a v = 0.001 . Fig. 4 is a plot of path length and average travel time when tested on similar sized (in terms of number of nodes and edges) lattice, small world, ER random, scale free and LFR networks. As expected, there appears to be a strong inverse correlation between average path length and average travel time. As lattice graphs have the longest path lengths, they have the lowest travel times. We know that by randomly rewiring edges, one can generate small world networks. Small world networks have longer travel times as path length decreases due to rewiring of edges (formation of shortcuts). In the extreme case of complete rewiring, we get ER random networks which have the shortest path lengths and the worst travel time performance. Also, scale free and LFR networks have comparable performance to ER random network owing to their shorter path lengths. 5.2 Effect of inhibitors on average travel time We now examine the effect of introducing inhibitors when selected according to random and centrality based selection (degree and betweenness centrality). In the centrality based strategy, nodes are ranked according to their centrality scores and we observe the effect of inhibitors by varying the number of inhibitors between 0 and 150 in increments of 10. Fig. 5 illustrates the dependence of average travel time of evacuees on inhibitors, when tested on different network topologies and risk distributions. While, the travel time decreases as the number of inhibitors increases irrespective of network topology. The rate of travel time reduction depends on network topology, risk distribution and inhibitor selection strategy. In the case of ER random (Fig. 5(a)) and lattice (Fig. 5(b)) networks, choosing inhibitors based on centrality does not result in a major improvement in performance. Small world networks (Fig. 5(c)) do show improvement with centrality based inhibitor selection as more central evacuees act as shortcuts for flow of influence. On the other hand, scale free and LFR networks are degree heterogeneous in nature \u2013 there are a few high degree nodes and a large number of low degree nodes. Therefore, random selection of inhibitors will likely result in the selection of low degree nodes which will not disrupt the flow of influence from evacuated to non-evacuated population. For this reason, when the influential evacuees are not in the risk region, centrality based strategy substantially reduces the travel time as opposed to random strategy. The degree based inhibitor selection assures that nodes with higher degree are picked which prevents the spread of influence through hubs. Both centrality measures perform equally well as degree and betweenness centrality are highly correlated. However, the average travel time does not change much with inhibitors when the risk region contains influential evacuees. Highly influential evacuee in the risk region causes an uninhibited spread of influence as they cannot be chosen as inhibitors. Also, Fig. 5(h) shows that the inhibitors have a strong impact on LFR network when all members of a community belong to a risk region. Networks with community structure naturally prevent the flow of influence as there are not enough edges between communities. Moreover, centrality based inhibitors selects nodes which acts like bridges between communities which further reduces the travel time. 5.3 Effect of inhibitors on total evacuation time Evacuation performance can also be measured based on total evacuation time (TET). In our case, we are only interested in measuring TET of the risk region as opposed to the entire evacuating population. TET is defined as the total time elapsed between the first departure and the last departure from the high risk region. We find that adding inhibitors has two competing effects on TET (a) TET will decrease as inhibitors will prevent low risk evacuees departing simultaneously with high risk evacuees (also referred to as shadow evacuation) (b) TET will increase as inhibitors will increase the average path length between evacuees in risk region. However, for high risk evacuees, the increase in TET due to average path length is nullified as the departure decision is dominated by the high threat level ( \u220a ). Fig. 6 illustrates the dependence of TET on number of inhibitors. TET decreases with number of inhibitors across all scenarios. Similar to average travel time, the rate of decrease in TET depends on network topology, risk distribution and inhibitor selection strategy. Centrality based inhibitor selection strategy results in major improvement in performance in degree heterogeneous networks like scale free and LFR (Fig. 6(d)\u2013(h)) compared to homogeneous networks like ER random (Fig. 6(a)), lattice (Fig. 6(b)) and small world (Fig. 6(c)) networks. In the case of heterogeneous networks, given the same number of inhibitors, the decrease in TET depends on the connectivity within the risk region. When the risk region contains influential evacuees (Fig. 6(e) and (g)), the shorter path lengths in risk region result in lower TET as influence spreads faster. Fig. 6(h) shows that in a scenario where all members of a community belong to the risk region has a lower TET when compared to just influential evacuees in high risk region. A community structure in risk region results in higher connectivity than a few influential evacuees which in turn is more connected than non-influential evacuees. TET is highest when only non-influential evacuees are in the risk region (Fig. 6(d) and (f)). This is a direct result of the connectivity of evacuees in the risk region. 5.4 Effect of strength of social ties In this section we study the effect of strength of ties ( \u03bb u , v ) which is the influence exerted by node u on v. In previous analysis, all edges were considered to have equal strengths ( \u03bb u , v = 1 ). However, in several real world social networks, nodes often belong to clusters or communities. These clusters are often formed on the basis of racial, sociological or political factors (Hasan and Ukkusuri, 2011; Lancichinetti et al., 2008). The social ties within a community tend to have stronger influences than outside a community. We investigate the effect of an edge weighting scheme which strengthens edges within communities and weakens edges between communities. For this analysis, we consider LFR benchmark networks which have an in-built community structure. Let E in \u2282 E be a subset of edges which lie within community. We set the strength of an edge \u03bb uv as (15) \u03bb uv = 3 | E | | E | + 2 | E in | if ( u , v ) \u2208 E in | E | | E | + 2 | E in | else Note that both weighted and unweighted networks have the same total strength. From Fig. 7 , it is clear that evacuation on a weighted network is more efficient than an unweighted network. The introduction of weights strengthens the connectivity between nodes of a community but weakens the connectivity between communities. The influence of evacuated nodes spreads rapidly within a community but is restricted across communities. Therefore, the congestion effects are mitigated with the introduction of weights. We also study the effect of inhibitor selection on weighted networks. Figs. 8 and 9 , illustrates that the effectiveness of degree based inhibitor selection strategy is not exceeded by any of the weighted inhibitor selection strategies. A simple degree based inhibitor selection strategy may be sufficient for a large range of topologies. 6 Conclusions Hurricane evacuation is an important part of disaster management as inefficient plans lead to loss of life and property. The performance of an evacuation process is measured in terms of average travel time experienced by the evacuees and the total time required to evacuate evacuees in high risk region. Travel delays are caused due to the inability of surface transportation to meet the sudden surge in evacuee demand. In this work we modeled evacuee departure time decision making processes to study the effect of evacuee contact network structure on evacuation performance. In a practical setting, our results are useful in making strategic decisions regarding additional capacity (e.g. contraflow) by estimating the social network topology of the evacuating community. For example, a well connected community (random, scale free networks) is likely to depart simultaneously and therefore would require additional road capacity. On the other extreme, a community with strong clusters (modular networks) or limited connectivity (lattice networks) are less likely to have a problem of overloading. Additionally, we also propose strategies to mitigate overloading by inhibiting a fraction of evacuee population called inhibitors from evacuating. We show that inhibiting a small subset of evacuees can significantly improve evacuation performance. Results suggest that evacuee social network with low average path length and low modularity benefit the most from introducing inhibitors. Both travel time and total evacuation time decreases with number of inhibitors. The rate of decrease depends on evacuee social network topology, risk distribution and inhibitor selection strategy. A simple degree based inhibitor selection works well in all weighted and unweighted network topologies. Furthermore, inhibitor selection strategy is immaterial in the case of homogeneous networks like random and small world networks. Given the same number and choice of inhibitors, total evacuation time is lower when risk region is more connected. Therefore, we want the risk region to be more connected (lower total evacuation time) but the non-risk region should be less connected (lower average travel time). Our inhibitor selection strategies are heuristic and purely based on evacuee social network topology without considering any individual behavioral traits. In the future, simulation based inhibitor selection strategies should be employed which explicitly optimize the average travel time. Also, as a part of future work we would like to analytically show that average travel time decreases with number of inhibitors for other random network topologies. Other potential future directions involve improved departure time choice models which is history and time dependent. References Alsnih and Stopher, 2004 R. Alsnih P.
