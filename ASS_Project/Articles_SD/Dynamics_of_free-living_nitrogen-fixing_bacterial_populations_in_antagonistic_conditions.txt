"Ecological ModellingDynamics of free-living nitrogen-fixing bacterial populations in antagonistic conditionsAbstract The survival of free-living nitrogen-fixing microbial populations in the natural ecosystem is crucial for the system maintenance and productivity due to the unique role of these organisms in the global biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen. The dynamics of a nitrogen-fixing microbial population grown at various conditions in a chemostat, together with a competitive (for the common resources) population, was studied through bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of the system. When the carbon source is found in abundance in the feed, then the competition for this nutrient is low. High amounts of ammonium nitrogen (a substance that inhibits growth of the nitrogen-fixing population) are assimilated for the growth needs of both populations. Under these conditions the nitrogen-fixing population can survive (alone or together with its competitor) in a wide range of parameter values and operating conditions and in some cases nitrogenase synthesis occurs. When the inflow medium contains low carbon substrate concentrations, high competition occurs for this nutrient. In these conditions the nitrogen-fixing population can survive only if it has the competitive advantage over its competitor. However, if the inflow medium contains high ammonium concentrations, the nitrogen-fixing population is inhibited and loses its competitive advantage. Under these conditions, only nitrogen-fixing populations, which are able to establish amensalistic interactions can survive in the system.serial JL 271743 291210 291728 291780 291840 31 Ecological Modelling ECOLOGICALMODELLING 2006-09-11 2006-09-11 2010-10-08T02:45:02 1-s2.0-S030438000600367X S0304-3800(06)00367-X S030438000600367X 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.07.037 S300 S300.1 FULL-TEXT 1-s2.0-S0304380006X04295 2015-05-14T06:43:49.314216-04:00 0 0 20070110 2007 2006-09-11T00:00:00Z articleinfo crossmark dco dateupdated tomb dateloaded datesearch indexeddate issuelist volumelist yearnav articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright dateloadedtxt docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid issfirst issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sectiontitle sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype subheadings volfirst volissue webpdf webpdfpagecount figure table body mmlmath acknowledge affil articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authkeywords authlast primabst ref alllist content subj ssids 0304-3800 03043800 200 200 1 2 1 2 Volume 200, Issues 1\u20132 25 243 253 243 253 20070110 10 January 2007 2007-01-10 2007 Research papers article fla Copyright \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Fig. 1 Conceptual diagram illustrating the models used for the study of dynamics of a nitrogen-fixing population grown in antagonistic conditions. A nitrogen-fixing population (N1) grows together with a competitive microbial population (N2) in the presence of ammonium nitrogen (NH3). The limiting growth factors are, for both populations, the carbon and energy source (S) and the NH3. When the concentration of NH3 is low in the growth environment, S is partitioned in order to sustain both, synthesis of cellular mass of N1 and nitrogenase (E) activity. When NH3 is accumulated in the growth environment, then, besides N1 population, E synthesis and activity are inhibited. The presence of N2 population, however, could discharge the system from NH3, and therefore could promote survival of N1 population. Additionally, the N1 population could establish an amensalistic interaction through the synthesis of an inhibitory substance (I) released in the growth environment (for details see text). Fig. 2 Bifurcation diagram (D vs. (NH3)f) for a chemostat system in which a nitrogen-fixing microbial population (N1) grows together with its competitor (N2). Parameter values are the ones of case G 1 in Table 1. Labelling of curves: T1, transcritical bifurcation between washout and N1 state; T2, transcritical bifurcation between washout and N2 state; T12, transcritical bifurcation between N1 and coexistence state; T21, transcritical bifurcation between N2 and coexistence state. L1, limit-point bifurcation of N1 state. The character of each steady state in the various regions is listed in Table 3.

Abstract The survival of free-living nitrogen-fixing microbial populations in the natural ecosystem is crucial for the system maintenance and productivity due to the unique role of these organisms in the global biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen. The dynamics of a nitrogen-fixing microbial population grown at various conditions in a chemostat, together with a competitive (for the common resources) population, was studied through bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of the system. When the carbon source is found in abundance in the feed, then the competition for this nutrient is low. High amounts of ammonium nitrogen (a substance that inhibits growth of the nitrogen-fixing population) are assimilated for the growth needs of both populations. Under these conditions the nitrogen-fixing population can survive (alone or together with its competitor) in a wide range of parameter values and operating conditions and in some cases nitrogenase synthesis occurs. When the inflow medium contains low carbon substrate concentrations, high competition occurs for this nutrient. In these conditions the nitrogen-fixing population can survive only if it has the competitive advantage over its competitor. However, if the inflow medium contains high ammonium concentrations, the nitrogen-fixing population is inhibited and loses its competitive advantage. Under these conditions, only nitrogen-fixing populations, which are able to establish amensalistic interactions can survive in the system. Keywords Population dynamics Competition Nitrogen fixation Free living Coexistence 1 Introduction The essential role of the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen for ecosystem equilibrium and productivity can explain the effort of many scientific groups to model the nitrogen cycle and to understand the dynamics behaviour of specific habitants (van Dam and van Breemen, 1995; Christian et al., 1996; Chapelle et al., 2000; Lin et al., 2000; Kercher and Chambers, 2001; Corbeels et al., 2005; Bruce et al., 2006; McNeil et al., 2006). This biogeochemical cycle is strongly dependent on the activities of certain prokaryotes, since plants, animals and most microorganisms require for their growth combined forms of nitrogen. The ability to fix atmospheric (molecular) nitrogen is restricted to a limited number of bacteria and symbiotic associations, including the well-known association of Rhizobium or Bradyrhizobium with leguminous plants (Postgate, 1982; Bailey and Ollis, 1986; Atlas and Bartha, 1993). Biological nitrogen fixation by free-living nitrogen-fixing microorganisms occurs in soils by several aerobic (i.e., genera Azotobacter, Beijerinckia) or microaerophilic (i.e Azospirillum) prokaryotes, as well as in marine and freshwater habitats, mainly by heterocystous cyanobacteria. In all these cases the conversion of molecular nitrogen to ammonium is performed through the action of nitrogenase complex, the synthesis and activity of which is strongly repressed by both ammonium nitrogen and molecular oxygen (Steenhoudt and Vanderleyden, 2000; Tsagou et al., 2003). Recently, many studies have been concerned with the physiology, ecology and potential use of free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria in agriculture and environmental biotechnology, especially those belonging to the genus Azospirillum (Fritzsche and Niemman, 1990; Ueckert and Fendrik, 1995; Kefalogianni and Aggelis, 2002; Tripathi et al., 2002; Tsagou et al., 2003; Bahat-Samet et al., 2004; Bashan et al., 2004). Populations of these bacteria are found in abundance in natural ecosystems, especially in the rhizosphere of certain cereals and other plants (D\u00f6bereiner and Day, 1976; Bashan and Holguin, 1997). In these relationships the bacteria receive non-specific photosynthate carbon from the plant and, in turn, provide the plant with fixed nitrogen, hormones, signal molecules, vitamins, iron, etc. (Bashan and Holguin, 1997; Zuberer, 1998; Bashan et al., 2004). Indeed, several strains of Azospirillum spp. are able to excrete ammonium in the rhizosphere environment (Bashan et al., 2004). Furthermore, Azospirillum spp. can successfully compete with several important soil-borne plant pathogens (e.g., by producing anti-microbial substances) and protect plants from their attack (Hassouna et al., 1998; Kavitha et al., 2003; Romero et al., 2003). In the soil ecosystem the survival and growth of free-living nitrogen-fixing populations are affected by many physical and chemical conditions, including the concentration and nature of organic components excreted by plant roots, as well as by the nature of interactions developed with other microbial populations and soil predators (Cacciari et al., 1986; Sol\u00e9 et al., 1992; Roberts and Stone, 2004; Bastolla et al., 2005). Several aspects of interactions between Azospirillum and other microorganisms, like nitrogen-fixing strains of Arthrobacter or arbuscular mychorrizal fungi, have been studied in experimental systems (Cacciari et al., 1986; Kloss et al., 1986; Mar V\u00e1zquez et al., 2000). While inoculation of cultivated soils with Azospirillum spp. represents a potential opportunity for agriculture (Bashan and Holguin, 1997; Okon and Vanderleyden, 1997), the growth of these bacteria is often limited by the low concentrations of the available carbon sources in the field (Klucas, 1991). Indeed, the low availability of assimilative carbon is enforced since nitrogen fixation is a high energy-consuming process requiring 20\u201330 ATP molecules per mole of N2 reduced to NH3. Various agro-industrial wastes with high C/N ratios (usually higher than 15), could be used as soil conditioners in order to provide free-living nitrogen-fixing bacterial populations with carbon and energy sources (Kefalogianni and Aggelis, 2002). However, the presence of some inhibitors (i.e., ammonium nitrogen) of Azospirillum spp. in cultivated soils or various wastes should be taken into account (P\u00f6tter et al., 2001; Tsagou et al., 2003). Although the addition of ammonium nitrogen in the growth medium enhances growth of Azospirillum under aerobic conditions (Okon et al., 1976), conversely, bacterial growth is inhibited in the presence of high ammonium and low dissolved oxygen concentrations (Hurek et al., 1987; Tsagou et al., 2003; Bashan et al., 2004). However, under microaerobic conditions, Azospirillum can grow in the presence of low ammonium concentrations and, after the depletion of ammonium, is able to sustain growth by fixing molecular nitrogen, provided that the energy source is accessible (Fritzsche et al., 1990; Fritzsche and Niemman, 1990; Kefalogianni and Aggelis, 2002). Interactions between species that share the same resources have been studied using numerous mathematical models (see, i.e., Smith and Waltman, 1995; Richards et al., 2000; Aggelis et al., 2005; Vayenas et al., 2005; Pei et al., 2005). In the traditional models (i.e., in the Lotka\u2013Volterra competition model and similar) the interaction of one species to the other is always negative, while coexistence occurs only if between-species competition is weaker than within species. Recently, a new model with introduction of mutualism between competitive species has been proposed (Zhang, 2003). It was found that mutualism could promote coexistence and enhance the carrying capacity of the system. In this paper the dynamics of a nitrogen-fixing microbial population grown in a chemostat together with a competitive (for the common resources) population will be studied using bifurcation analysis, in order to determine the influence of several important parameters on its survival. The effect of both carbon source and ammonium nitrogen concentrations in the feed on the population dynamics is studied in a wide range of operating conditions and parameter values. 2 Modeling We consider a chemostat in which a nitrogen-fixing population grows together with a competitive microbial population in the presence of ammonium nitrogen. We assume that the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low enough to allow nitrogenase synthesis (when the ammonium nitrogen concentration is low), while the limiting growth factors are, for both populations, the common resources (the carbon and energy source and the mineral nitrogen). A major difference of this system from the classic systems with two competitor populations is associated with the presence of the nitrogenase in the system. Specifically, the nitrogen-fixing population is able to partition the carbon source, when the concentration of ammonium nitrogen is low in the growth environment, in order to sustain both, synthesis of cellular mass and nitrogenase activity. Therefore, an important amount of the carbon source is absorbed in the nitrogenase reaction. Furthermore, when ammonium nitrogen is accumulated in the growth environment, then, the nitrogen-fixing population N1 is strongly inhibited (Hurek et al., 1987; Tsagou et al., 2003; Tsagou and Aggelis, 2006). The presence of antagonistic population, able to assimilate fixed forms of nitrogen, could discharge the system from ammonium nitrogen, and therefore could promote survival of the nitrogen-fixing population. A conceptual diagram illustrating the system used is given in Fig. 1 , while the mathematical models are presented below. 2.1 Model I In the first model it is assumed that a nitrogen-fixing microbial population (N1) grows in a chemostat, together with a competitive microbial population (N2), while no other interactions (except for competition for the common resources) between the two populations occur.Equations of this system are: balance of N1 and N2 populations: (1) d N 1 d t = ( r 1 \u2212 D ) N 1 (2) d N 2 d t = ( r 2 \u2212 D ) N 2 where r 1, r 2 are the specific growth rates of the N1 and N2 populations, respectively; D is the chemostat dilution rate. Balance of carbon and energy source: (3) d S d t = D ( S f \u2212 S ) \u2212 r 1 N 1 1 Y N 1 /S \u2212 r 2 N 2 1 Y N 2 /S \u2212 r E E 1 Y N H 3 /S N 1 where S f and S are the carbon source concentrations in the inlet and outlet medium, respectively; Y N 1 /S , Y N 2 /S the yield coefficients of N1 and N2 on S, respectively; E the nitrogenase concentration (units per volume of N1); r E the specific rate of nitrogen fixation; Y N H 3 /S is the ammonium nitrogen yield coefficient on S. Balance of ammonium nitrogen: (4) dN H 3 d t = D [ ( N H 3 ) f \u2212 ( N H 3 ) ] + r E E N 1 \u2212 r 1 N 1 1 Y N 1 /N H 3 \u2212 r 2 N 2 1 Y N 2 /N H 3 where (NH3)f and (NH)3 are the ammonium nitrogen concentrations in the inlet and outlet medium, respectively; Y N 1 /N H 3 and Y N 2 /N H 3 are the yield coefficients on ammonium nitrogen of N1 and N2, respectively. Balance of nitrogenase (units per volume of N1): (5) d E d t = q E \u2212 r D E \u2212 r 1 E where q E is the specific rate of nitrogenase synthesis; r D is the specific rate of nitrogenase destruction. In Eq. (5) the term r 1 E represents the decrease of active protein concentration observed due to the increase of the cell volume (Fredrickson, 1976). The specific growth rate of the N1 population is modeled by Monod's model (Monod, 1942) as modified by Graef and Andrews (1974): (6) r 1 ( S ,N H 3 ) = r 1 max S K 1 S + S N H 3 K 1 N H 3 + N H 3 + ( K i N H 3 ( N H 3 ) 2 ) where r 1max is the maximum specific growth rate; K 1S and K 1 N H 3 the saturation constants for S and NH3, respectively; K i N H 3 is the inhibition constant of ammonium nitrogen on N1. Nitrogen-fixing activity is regulated in both nitrogenase synthesis (genes transcription) and nitrogenase activity levels, as following (Eqs. (7)\u2013(10)). The specific rate of nitrogenase synthesis is given as (7) q E ( Q , r 1 ) = a r 1 Q where Q is described by the equation: (8) Q ( N H 3 ) = 1 1 + C N H 3 where C is a parameter related to the nif operators found under catabolic repression. In Eq. (7) Q is a function of the repressor compound (NH3). The factor Q accounts for modification of the rate of nitrogenase synthesis via a catabolic repression control mode (for mechanism of catabolic repression see Bailey and Ollis, 1986). Imanaka and Aiba (1977) in a classical report on the regulation of enzyme synthesis, have developed an equation that describes Q as a function of the equilibrium constant for binding between cAMP and catabolite gene activator protein (CAP), of the equilibrium constant for binding between the complex cAMP\u00d7CAP and promoter gene and of the concentration of the repressor. Function Q of the Imanaka\u2013Aiba model represents the fraction of the repressor-free operators. The simplified form of this model is (9) Q = 1 + A S 1 + B S where A and B are constants related to repressor-free and to repressed operators, respectively. Other authors have proposed similar equations for Q (Pasari et al., 1987; Moresi et al., 1991). Galiotou-Panayotou et al. (1998) have experimentally found that, in some cases, parameter A takes low values, near zero. Thus, in the present model Eq. (8) is used. In this equation the term C represents the sensitivity of the genes, which code for nitrogenase synthesis to the ammonium nitrogen. The specific rate of nitrogen fixation is given by the equation: (10) r E ( S ,N H 3 ) = r E max K i E K i E + N H 3 S K SE + S where r Emax is the maximum specific rate of nitrogen fixation; K SE the saturation constant; K iE is the inhibition constant. The specific rate for microbial growth of the non-nitrogen-fixing population (N2) is given by the following equation: (11) r 2 ( S ,N H 3 ) = r 2 max S K 2 S + S N H 3 K 2 N H 3 + N H 3 where r 2max is the maximum specific growth rate of the N2 population; K 2S and K 2 N H 3 the saturation constants for S and NH3, respectively. 2.2 Model II The second model involves the ability of the nitrogen-fixing population to establish an amensalistic interaction through the synthesis of an inhibitory substance released in the growth environment. Actually, Azospirillum species can successfully compete with several saprophytic populations, as well as with important soil-borne plant pathogens (e.g., by producing anti-microbial substances) (Hassouna et al., 1998; Kavitha et al., 2003; Romero et al., 2003). The balance equation for the inhibitor in the chemostat is used in addition to Eqs. (1)\u2013(5) in model II. Balance of inhibitor:(12) d I d t = ( a I r 1 + b I ) N 1 \u2212 D I where a I is a stoichiometric constant for production of the inhibitor (I) during primary metabolic growth; b I is a stoichiometric constant for production of the inhibitor (I) during secondary metabolic growth. Accordingly, Eqs. (6)\u2013(8) and (10) could be used for the specific rates, while Eq. (11) that describes specific growth rate of the N2 population should be replaced by the following equation: (13) r 2 ( S ,N H 3 ) = r 2 max S K 2 S + S N H 3 K 2 N H 3 + N H 3 K i K i + I where K i is the inhibition constant. 3 Methodology One would like to know the effect of the parameter values of the system on its long-term behaviour. Of particular importance is the effect of the operating parameters, i.e., of the chemostat dilution rate D, controlled by the flowrate through the reactor and of the concentration of the limiting factors (carbon and nitrogen) in the feed. An illustrative way to present the effect of those parameters on the system is through bifurcation diagrams. In such a diagram each region represents parameter values for which the system exhibits different dynamic behaviour. The boundaries of those regions are locations where bifurcations occur and the system undergoes a qualitative change in its dynamic behaviour. This qualitative change consists in the change of the number or the character (stability) of steady and periodic states. Construction of a bifurcation diagram is achieved by tracing the location of bifurcations in the two-parameter space. This is accomplished with the help of numerical algorithms that we have developed and are based on the continuation algorithm AUTO (Doedel et al., 1997). For the above-mentioned systems there are four possible steady states: (1) Extinction of both populations: N1 =N2 =0 (washout state). (2) Survival of N1 only: N1 >0, N2 =0 (N1 state). (3) Survival of N2 only: N2 >0, N1 =0 (N2 state). (4) Survival of both populations: N1 >0, N2 >0 (N1N2 state). In addition, there is also the possibility of stable periodic state of coexistence of N1 and N2, in which the population densities in the chemostat vary periodically with time. The form of the bifurcation diagram of the system depends on the values of the kinetic parameters and in particular on those of the specific growth rates (depending on both r max and K S) of the two populations. Important role plays the relative location of the specific growth rate curves with respect to each other. Besides r max and K S, the inhibition constant of the ammonium nitrogen also affects the specific growth rate of the N1 population, while the inhibition constant for the antibiotic compound I (produced by N1) affects the specific growth rate of the N2 population (Eqs. (6) and (13)). The population dynamics were studied for all possible cases of relative location of the two specific growth rate curves, while the parameter values were selected to be in the range of those experimentally determined in bioreactor cultures for various strains of Azospirillum brasilense and Azospirillum lipoferum isolated in Greece (Kefalogianni and Aggelis, 2002) or other places (Fritzsche et al., 1990) or for A. lipoferum Sp59b (ATCC 29707) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Tsagou and Aggelis, 2006). It should be noted that parameters describing growth in the natural (soil) ecosystem are not available yet, while parameter values determined in laboratory cultures may differ from those obtained in the natural ecosystem. The parameter values for these cases are listed in Tables 1 and 2 . Specifically, model I was analyzed for 8 sets of parameter values, listed in Table 1 (cases A1\u2013H1), while 16 sets of parameter values were used in the analysis of model II (cases A2\u2013P2), listed in Table 2. 4 Results 4.1 Model I. Dynamics of a nitrogen-fixing population grown together with a competitive for the common resources population in a chemostat Bifurcation diagrams in the D versus (NH3)f and D versus S f planes were constructed for all cases shown in Table 1. Examples are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 for the G1 case. In this case, the population N1 has the competitive advantage over N2 at low concentration of NH3, whereas it is strongly inhibited (by ammonium nitrogen) and loses its competitive advantage at (NH3)f >1.5g/L. The diagram D versus (NH3)f for the G1 case (Fig. 2) was constructed for S f =5g/L. It consists of four transcritical bifurcation curves (marked T1, T2, T12, T21), on which two steady states exchange stability characteristics and one limit-point bifurcation curve (L1) on which two steady states are born. The character of each steady state in the various regions of the diagram, as well as of all other bifurcation diagrams, is listed in Table 3 . S denotes stable steady state, whereas U1 indicates an unstable steady state with one positive eigenvalue and U2 an unstable steady state with two eigenvalues with positive real parts. In region 1 of the diagram only extinction of the populations is possible, since the washout state is the only stable. In region 2, two steady states are stable, the washout state and the state of survival of the N1 population (multistability). It depends on the initial state of the chemostat which of the two states will be eventually reached. In regions 3\u20135 the state of survival of the N1 population is only the stable. Multistability is also observed in regions 6, 7, 9 since both the N1 state and the N2 state are stable. In region 8 the population N2 dominates over N1, as the N2 state is the only stable. Coexistence exists only in regions 6 and 9, but it is unstable and cannot be observed. The D versus S f diagram for the G1 case (Fig. 3) was constructed for (NH3)f =3g/L. At this concentration of ammonium nitrogen the population N1 is strongly inhibited (see Fig. 2). In addition to the regions found in the D versus (NH3)f diagram (Fig. 2) three new regions, namely 13, 16 and 17, are present. On the other hand regions 2, 3 and 6 do not appear. In region 13 both the N1 state and the N2 state are stable (multistability), while in regions 16 and 17 the N2 state is the only stable. Similar results, to those obtained by using the set of parameter values of the G1 case, are obtained when the parameter values of the E1, F1 and H1 cases are used and thus the operating diagrams for these cases are not shown. In the cases A1\u2013D1 the population N1 is slightly inhibited by ammonium nitrogen. In the A1 and B1 cases the population N1 has the competitive advantage at low ammonium concentration only. Thus, the results obtained by using the parameter values of the A1 or B1 cases are similar to those obtained by using the set of parameter values of the G1 case and are not shown. Conversely, in the C1, D1 cases the population N1 has the competitive advantage over N2 for the whole range of ammonium concentration. In these cases the survival state of the population N1 is stable at high values of D, whereas the N2 state is stable at low values of D (results not shown). In general, nitrogenase synthesis is favoured at low values of D and above a S f concentration depending on the NH3 concentration in the feed. For instance, when (NH3)f =3g/L no significant nitrogenase amount was observed at S f <1g/L. At a constant S f concentration nitrogenase synthesis is favoured at low NH3 concentrations in the inflow medium. When (NH3)f increases, the enzyme concentration decreases. 4.2 Model II. Dynamics of a nitrogen-fixing population (able to establish an amensalistic interaction) grown together with a competitive for the common resources population in a chemostat The effect of the parameter K i that describes the sensitivity of the N2 population to the inhibitor produced by N1 is additionally studied here. Representative examples of bifurcation diagrams (in the D versus NH3 and D versus S planes) are presented. In the case G2 of Table 2 the population N2 is strongly inhibited by the compound I, produced during both primary and secondary metabolic growth of N1. The population N1 has the competitive advantage over N2 at low ammonium concentrations (e.g., (NH3)f <1.5g/L). However, due to the high K iNH3 value, the population N1 is strongly inhibited at high concentrations of ammonium nitrogen, and therefore, loses its competitive advantage. The bifurcation diagram of D versus (NH3)f (for S f =5g/L) of the case G2 is shown in Fig. 4 , where the numbering of the regions is consistent with the one in the diagrams shown in Figs. 2 and 3. This diagram contains four transcritical bifurcation curves (T1, T2, T12, T21), two limit-point bifurcation curves (L and L1) and one Hopf bifurcation curve (HB) on which a stable periodic state of coexistence is born. Comparing this diagram with the one shown in Fig. 2 for the G1 case we observe that five new regions appear (namely 10\u201315), due to the additional interaction between the two populations caused by the inhibitory compound I. Furthermore, in the diagram of the G2 case the regions of multistability 6 and 9 (in which both states of survival of N1 and N2 alone are stable) are not present, whereas region 5 (in which the state of survival of N1 is the only stable) is greatly reduced. Multistability is observed in region 11 since the states of survival of each population alone (N1 and N2 states), as well as the coexistence state, are stable. It depends on the initial conditions which state will be reached by the system. Multistability is also observed in region 15, where both the state of survival of N1 and the state of coexistence are stable, and in regions 13 and 14 where both the state of survival of N1 and state of survival of N2 are stable. In region 10 there is also multistability, since survival of the N1 population is observed in a stable steady state together with a stable coexistence periodic state. Finally, in region 12 survival of each population alone is observed in a stable steady state and coexistence in a stable periodic state. The bifurcation diagram of D versus S f (for (NH3)f =3g/L) of the G2 case is given in Fig. 5 . This diagram is compared to the one of the G1 case (Fig. 3), which was computed for the same parameter values. Region 5 (in which only the state of survival of N1 is stable) of the diagram for the G1 case occupies a considerable part of the diagram. This region is greatly reduced in the diagram of the G2 case, as a significant part of this region is replaced by regions 10 (in which, besides of survival of N1 in a stable steady state, coexistence is possible in stable periodic state) and mainly 15 (in which both the state of survival of N1 and the state of coexistence are stable). Similarly, region 13 of the diagram of the G1 case, in which we have multistability (both N1 and N2 states are stable), is greatly reduced in the diagram of the G2 case. In its place we observe region 11, in which we have multistability, since both the state of survival of N1 and the state of coexistence are stable steady states, and the small region 12, in which similarly to region 11 we have multistability, but N1 survives in a stable steady state and coexistence is observed in a stable periodic state. Region 16 (in which the N2 state is the only stable) is significantly reduced in the diagram of the G2 case (compared to the diagram of the G1 case), while region 9 (in which we have multistability of N1 state and N2 state) is respectively increased. In the cases E2, F2, M2 and N2 of Table 2 the population N1 loses its competitive advantage over N2 at low ammonium concentration (i.e., (NH3)f <0.7g/L). Therefore, the respective diagrams are similar to the one obtained for the G2 case, although, in some cases, region 8 (in which the state of survival of N2 is the only stable) is significantly increased (results not shown). Also, in the cases O2 and P2 the population N1 has the competitive advantage at low ammonium concentration (i.e., (NH3)f <1.5g/L). In the respective diagrams we find all regions observed in Fig. 4, although the regions in which the coexistence state is stable (regions 11 and 15) are significantly reduced. When the amensalistic interaction was present, nitrogenase synthesis occurred even at low concentrations of S in the inflow medium, provided that D was low. At a constant concentration of S f, nitrogenase synthesis is favoured at low NH3 concentrations in the inflow medium (results not shown). At high S f concentrations (i.e., S f >2.5g/L) the concentration of nitrogenase is independent of the synthesis of the inhibitory substance by the N1 population. 5 Discussion Many works have been done on the modeling of biogeochemical nitrogen cycling in natural ecosystems (van Dam and van Breemen, 1995; Christian et al., 1996; Chapelle et al., 2000; Lin et al., 2000; Kercher and Chambers, 2001; Corbeels et al., 2005; Bruce et al., 2006; McNeil et al., 2006). The present model is focused on the biochemical details of nitrogen fixation and the dynamics of free-living nitrogen-fixing populations, and thus, could be combined with the above-mentioned works, in order to improve predictive ability of the models or correctly describe ecosystem capacity. The physiology of free-living nitrogen-fixing microorganisms, especially those belonging to the genus Azospirillum, has been extensively studied for many years due to the unique role of these bacteria in the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen (Postgate, 1982). However, the population dynamics of these bacteria has not been sufficiently studied so far. The few experimental studies published in this field concern interactions between Azospirillum strains and other microorganisms (Cacciari et al., 1986; Kloss et al., 1986; Mar V\u00e1zquez et al., 2000). The dynamics of free-living nitrogen-fixing bacterial populations exhibit several distinct features related to their physiology. Environmental factors, such as the dissolved oxygen and the ammonium nitrogen, affect their growth and biochemical activities (at least of the bacteria belonging to the important genus of Azospirillum) (Steenhoudt and Vanderleyden, 2000; Kefalogianni and Aggelis, 2002; Tsagou et al., 2003; Tsagou and Aggelis, 2006). Actually, in microaerobic conditions (where the nitrogen fixation process occurs), the ammonium nitrogen inhibits, besides nitrogenase synthesis and activity, bacterial growth (Tsagou et al., 2003; Tsagou and Aggelis, 2006). Furthermore, competitive interactions are often established between microbial populations, since many nutrients are found in limited concentrations in common habitats (Cacciari et al., 1986). Although the free-living nitrogen-fixing populations need enormous quantities of chemical energy to support nitrogen-fixing activity, they are not able to develop strict symbiotic interactions with higher plants. They have, therefore, to share several nutrients, including organic carbon, with competitive populations in the antagonistic environment of the rhizosphere (Klucas, 1991; Bashan and Holguin, 1997). While Azospirillum spp. are able to establish amensalistic interactions in the micro-environment they live, the fact that they have to compete for energy resources limits their growth and activities in nature (Bashan et al., 2004). The presence of antagonistic populations, however, could relieve the growth environment from certain inhibitors, such as ammonium nitrogen. It is possible, therefore, that the nitrogen-fixing populations are affected by their competitors in two opposite ways (Zhang, 2003; Roberts and Stone, 2004; Bastolla et al., 2005): negatively due to the competition occurring for the common resources, and positively due to the decrease of the ammonium nitrogen concentration related to the growth of the competitive population. In this paper we studied the dynamics of a chemostat system in which a nitrogen-fixing bacterial population (N1) grows together with a competitive for carbon and nitrogen sources population (N2). Monod's model, in which the specific growth rate is a Holling type II functional response, is used in order to model the microbial growth in the chemostat. This model offers the possibility of modification of the nutrient uptake by altering the parameter values such as the maximum specific growth rate and the saturation constant (Vayenas and Pavlou, 1999, 2001; Aggelis et al., 2005; Vayenas et al., 2005). When the chemostat is fed with a medium containing high concentrations of the carbon source (i.e., S f =5g/L), the N1 population can survive in a stable steady state for a wide range of parameter values and operating conditions. Multistability (N1 state and N2 state) is observed above a threshold of ammonium concentration that is determined by the values of some parameters, such as the K iNH3, which represents the sensitivity of the population N1 to ammonium (e.g., in Fig. 2). It is worth noting that under these conditions there are not regions of stable coexistence state in the operating diagrams. Coexistence of the populations occurs only in an unstable state at very high ammonium concentrations. On the contrary Zhang (2003) has found, by using a general Lotka\u2013Volterra competition model, that mutualism or cooperation could promote coexistences of competitive populations. The balance of positive\u2013negative effects of population N2 on the survival of N1 could be modified by population N1 itself, i.e., by establishing an amensalistic interaction through the production of an inhibitory substance that has a negative effect on the specific growth rate of population N2. Such a modification of the specific growth rate of N2 might favour the survival of population N1 by making it more competitive. However, the protection offered by population N2 (through the reduction of ammonium concentration) on population N1 is reduced. Therefore, the final outcome of the environmental shift on the population dynamics could be positive, negative or neutral for one or for both populations, depending on the parameter values used. In the present work it was found, by using a wide range of parameter values, that, when the population N2 is inhibited (by the amensalistic interaction established by N1) then, the N1 state is negatively affected at high NH3 concentration in the inflow medium (i.e., decrease of region 5 from Figs. 2\u20134), while coexistence becomes attainable, either as a stable steady state (regions 11 and 15, Fig. 4) or a stable periodic state (regions 10 and 12, Fig. 4). Kefalogianni and Aggelis (2002), Tsagou et al. (2003), and Tsagou and Aggelis (2006) have experimentally found that the boundaries of ammonium nitrogen concentration in which A. lipoferum can be adapted depend on the DO concentration in the growth environment. Modification of the balance of positive\u2013negative effects of population N2 on population N1 can also be achieved by altering the operating conditions, i.e., by shifting the carbon/nitrogen ratio in the feed. It is demonstrated that at low carbon substrate concentrations in the feed (i.e., S f <1g/L) and at inhibitory ammonium concentrations ((NH3)f =3g/L), the N2 state is the only stable (Fig. 3). At high concentrations of the carbon substrate, however, the states of survival of N1 or of the coexistence of both N1 and N2 populations are favoured. When population N1 is able to establish an amensalistic interaction in the growth environment, then it can survive in a stable steady state; even at low carbon substrate concentrations, multistability (N1 state and N2 state) is observed (Fig. 5). However, at high concentrations of the carbon source, a region in which the N1 state is the only stable (region 5, Fig. 3) is replaced by a region of multistability in which both the state of the survival of N1 and the state of coexistence are stable (region 15, Fig. 5). The threshold of the S concentration at which nitrogenase synthesis occurs depends on the NH3 concentration. It appears that at increased concentrations of S in the inflow medium, higher quantities of NH3 are consumed for biomass synthesis of both N1 and N2 populations. Thus, the concentration of NH3 in the chemostat remains low enough to allow nitrogenase synthesis by the N1 population. 6 Conclusions The dynamics of microbial populations in natural habitats is strongly dependent on a number of interactions occurring among the various populations and between the populations and the physicochemical environments as well. Indeed, several interactions simultaneously influence positively or negatively the survival of a given microbial population. The balance of these positive\u2013negative effects, which can be modified through the biological and the physicochemical parameters of growth, determines the long-term behaviour of the system. The model proposed in this paper for the study of dynamics of free-living nitrogen-fixing bacterial populations further support previous hypothesis that competitors may affect each other in both, negative and positive ways, and this complex interaction may promote coexistence (see i.e., Zhang, 2003). The survival of free-living nitrogen-fixing microbial populations in a natural ecosystem is crucial for the system maintenance and productivity, due to the unique role of these organisms in the global biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen. Also, these organisms are used in several applications of agricultural biotechnology, since inoculation of cultivated soils with Azospirillum spp. represents a potential opportunity for agriculture. The model proposed in this paper could be a useful tool for predicting population dynamics and determining optimum conditions for survival of nitrogen-fixing populations in the natural ecosystem. Actually, it is demonstrated that the dynamics of free-living nitrogen-fixing populations, grown in a chemostat together with a competitive population, depends on the concentrations of the carbon source and ammonium nitrogen in the inflow medium. When the carbon source is in abundance in the feed, then the competition for this nutrient is low, while high amounts of ammonium nitrogen are assimilated for the growth needs of both populations. In these conditions the nitrogen-fixing population can survive, alone or together with its competitor, in a wide range of parameter values and operating conditions; even at high ammonium concentrations in the inflow medium the nitrogen-fixing population can survive in the system. However, if the nitrogen-fixing population is able to establish an amensalistic interaction in the chemostat, the operating conditions in which the survival of this population is the only stable state are reduced and the coexistence of both populations is favoured. When the inflow medium contains low carbon substrate concentrations, intense competition for this nutrient occurs. In these conditions, the nitrogen-fixing population can survive only if it has the competitive advantage over its competitor. However, if at the same time the feed contains high ammonium nitrogen concentrations, the nitrogen-fixing population loses its competitive advantage; even if it has higher maximum specific growth rate and lower saturation constant for the carbon source it cannot survive in the system. In these conditions, only nitrogen-fixing populations, which are able to establish an amensalistic interaction in the growth environment can survive. When the system is fed with medium rich in carbon substrate, nitrogenase synthesis occurs even at increased concentrations of NH3 in the inflow medium. In these conditions high quantities of NH3 are absorbed for biomass synthesis (of both N1 and N2 populations) and therefore, the concentration of NH3 in the chemostat remains low enough to allow nitrogenase synthesis by the N1 population.
