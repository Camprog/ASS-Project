"Ecological ModellingModeling pesticide fate in a small tidal estuaryAbstract The exposure analysis modeling system (EXAMS), a pesticide fate model developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, was modified to model the fate of the herbicides atrazine and metolachlor in a small tidally dominated estuary (Bath Creek) in North Carolina, USA where freshwater inflow accounts for only 3% of the total flow. The modifications simulated the changes that occur during the tidal cycle in the estuary, scenarios that are not possible with the original EXAMS model. Two models were created within EXAMS, a steady-state model and a time-variant tidally driven model. The steady-state model accounted for tidal flushing by simply altering freshwater input to yield an estuary residence time equal to that measured in Bath Creek. The tidal EXAMS model explicitly incorporated tidal flushing by modifying the EXAMS code to allow for temporal changes in estuary physical attributes (e.g., volume). The models were validated with empirical measurements of atrazine and metolachlor concentrations in the estuary shortly after herbicide application in nearby fields and immediately following a rain event. Both models provided excellent agreement with measured concentrations. The steady-state EXAMS model accurately predicted atrazine concentrations in the middle of the estuary over the first 3 days and under-predicted metolachlor by a factor of 2\u20133. The time-variant, tidally driven EXAMS model accurately predicted the rise and plateau of both herbicides over the 6-day measurement period. We have demonstrated the ability of these modified EXAMS models to be useful in predicting pesticide fate and exposure in small tidal estuaries. This is a significant improvement and expansion of the application of EXAMS, and given the wide use of EXAMS for surface water quality modeling by both researchers and regulators and the ability of EXAMS to interface with terrestrial models (e.g., pesticide root zone model) and bioaccumulation models, we now have an easily-accessible and widely accepted means of modeling chemical fate in estuaries.serial JL 271743 291210 291728 291780 291840 31 Ecological Modelling ECOLOGICALMODELLING 2006-08-28 2006-08-28 2010-10-08T02:45:02 1-s2.0-S0304380006003176 S0304-3800(06)00317-6 S0304380006003176 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.07.013 S300 S300.1 FULL-TEXT 1-s2.0-S0304380006X04295 2015-05-14T06:43:49.314216-04:00 0 0 20070110 2007 2006-08-28T00:00:00Z articleinfo crossmark dco dateupdated tomb dateloaded datesearch indexeddate issuelist volumelist yearnav articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright dateloadedtxt docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid issfirst issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sectiontitle sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype subheadings volfirst volissue webpdf webpdfpagecount figure table body affil articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authkeywords authlast primabst ref alllist content subj ssids 0304-3800 03043800 200 200 1 2 1 2 Volume 200, Issues 1\u20132 14 149 159 149 159 20070110 10 January 2007 2007-01-10 2007 Research papers article fla Copyright \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract The exposure analysis modeling system (EXAMS), a pesticide fate model developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, was modified to model the fate of the herbicides atrazine and metolachlor in a small tidally dominated estuary (Bath Creek) in North Carolina, USA where freshwater inflow accounts for only 3% of the total flow. The modifications simulated the changes that occur during the tidal cycle in the estuary, scenarios that are not possible with the original EXAMS model. Two models were created within EXAMS, a steady-state model and a time-variant tidally driven model. The steady-state model accounted for tidal flushing by simply altering freshwater input to yield an estuary residence time equal to that measured in Bath Creek. The tidal EXAMS model explicitly incorporated tidal flushing by modifying the EXAMS code to allow for temporal changes in estuary physical attributes (e.g., volume). The models were validated with empirical measurements of atrazine and metolachlor concentrations in the estuary shortly after herbicide application in nearby fields and immediately following a rain event. Both models provided excellent agreement with measured concentrations. The steady-state EXAMS model accurately predicted atrazine concentrations in the middle of the estuary over the first 3 days and under-predicted metolachlor by a factor of 2\u20133. The time-variant, tidally driven EXAMS model accurately predicted the rise and plateau of both herbicides over the 6-day measurement period. We have demonstrated the ability of these modified EXAMS models to be useful in predicting pesticide fate and exposure in small tidal estuaries. This is a significant improvement and expansion of the application of EXAMS, and given the wide use of EXAMS for surface water quality modeling by both researchers and regulators and the ability of EXAMS to interface with terrestrial models (e.g., pesticide root zone model) and bioaccumulation models, we now have an easily-accessible and widely accepted means of modeling chemical fate in estuaries. Keywords Pesticide Atrazine Metolachlor EXAMS Modeling Water quality Estuaries 1 Introduction Estuaries are important and productive ecosystems that support a variety of living resources. These resources are extremely vulnerable, especially at key life stages, to the adverse effects of the many pollutants delivered to the estuary by tributary rivers and drainage from lands adjacent to the estuary. Many estuaries, particularly along the southeast Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States, are surrounded by agricultural lands upon which a variety of pesticides may be applied. Moreover, rapid urbanization continues to occur in the coastal zone, and pesticide occurrence in streams draining urban areas typically exceeds that of streams draining agricultural lands (U.S. Geological Survey, 1999). Atmospheric deposition of pesticides is also increasingly recognized as a major direct source of these contaminants to estuaries (Harmon-Fetcho et al., 2000). Because of the many potential sources of pesticides, it is not surprising that pesticides have been detected in a variety of estuarine environments. Pesticides were measured in sediments and fish tissue of South Florida estuaries, with some concentrations exceeding guidance values (Macauley et al., 2002), and in Gulf of Mexico tidal bayous receiving drainage from urban areas in Florida (Lewis et al., 2001). Triazine herbicides were detected in 93% of samples collected in tidal creeks downstream from agricultural areas along the Texas Gulf coast (Pennington et al., 2001), and sugarcane production in Louisiana has been linked to the presence of atrazine in coastal bays and estuaries in that state (Southwick et al., 2002). A variety of pesticides have been detected in West Coast estuaries, including the Gulf of California (Reyes et al., 1999); San Diego Bay (Schiff et al., 2002); Monterey Bay (Phillips et al., 2004); San Francisco Bay (Kuivila and Foe, 1995; Thompson et al., 2000); the Columbia River estuary (McCarthy and Gale, 1999), as well as numerous other locations. Modeling tools are needed to assess the potential exposure of estuarine living resources to pesticides in order to manage current applications and to provide more information for registration of new compounds. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) typically uses a tiered approach to determine the level of modeling needed for pesticide risk assessment. Tiers I and II modeling provides estimates of pesticide concentrations in surface waters through the combined application of the pesticide root zone model (PRZM; Smith et al., 1991) and the exposure analysis modeling system (EXAMS; Burns, 2000). Loadings of pesticides dissolved in runoff waters and sorbed to entrained sediment are predicted at the edge of the field by PRZM. Transport, volatilization, sorption, hydrolysis, biodegradation, and photolysis in the standard waterbody are subsequently simulated by EXAMS (for example, Wauchope et al., 2002); EXAMS is sometimes used in a stand-alone mode as well. A standard farm pond is used for aquatic exposure assessments and a standard water-supply lake is used for determination of drinking water safety (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2006). In the absence of data, which is generally the case, results from these models such as PRZM\u2013EXAMS represent the only estimate of pesticide exposure in aquatic systems. A standard modeling tool, however, has not been developed for estuaries. Estuaries are brackish water environments that experience frequent fluctuations in salinity as a result of tides and changes in freshwater inflows. Variable stream inflow, wind and tidally influenced hydrodynamics, and complex water chemistry make these environments different from the freshwater bodies for which EXAMS was designed. A limited number of pesticide models that were designed primarily for freshwater systems, including the EXAMS model, have been applied to estuarine systems to simulate transport at the field scale (i.e., movement of pesticides from the application site to groundwater or adjacent surface waters). However, these attempts required assumptions (Kolset and Heiberg, 1988; Siewicki, 1997), such as steady flows and the absence of tidal fluctuations. In addition, complications of high ionic strength waters (saltwater) on aquatic chemistry are typically ignored. These assumptions limit the usefulness of freshwater models for assessing pesticide exposure in estuaries. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the use of the existing steady-state EXAMS model to predict pesticide exposure in estuarine waters, modify EXAMS to account for tidal variations in an estuary, and use atrazine and metolachlor data collected in a small North Carolina, USA estuary to evaluate the revised EXAMS model. A small estuary, Bath Creek, North Carolina, was chosen as the test site due to our knowledge of important physical characteristics and our ability to measure pesticide exposure in this system. Atrazine and metolachlor, both of which are agricultural herbicides, were chosen as test chemicals because they are the most widely used and most frequently detected pesticides in the study region (Woodside and Ruhl, 2001). 2 Methods 2.1 Study area description Bath Creek is a small (4.2km2 surface area) tidal estuary that drains approximately 65km2 of forest and agricultural lands. The drainage basin for Bath Creek lies entirely in Beaufort County, North Carolina, which has an area of 2144km2 and a 2000 population of 42,283. Bath Creek is a tributary to the Pamlico River, an approximately 65km long estuary that is at the terminus of the 11,150km2 Tar-Pamlico River Basin. From 1994 to 1996, the Pamlico River and sub-embayments were included in the USEPA's environmental modeling and assessment program (EMAP) study of the Carolinian Province (Balthis et al., 1998). The primary cause of water turnover in Bath Creek is tidal fluctuation. There is minimal freshwater input into the creek from agricultural drainage ditches, but pesticides can enter the system through non-point source runoff, groundwater seepage, or associated stream flow. The tidal range in Bath Creek is approximately 0.3m, resulting in a flushing time of 3.9 days (using a non-segmented tidal prism model). Deployment of surface drogues in the bay resulted in an average residence time of 3.2 days, with shorter residence times near the mouth of the bay and longer residence times (up to 7 days) in more stagnant areas near the head of the bay. Salinity at the mouth of Bath Creek ranges from near 0 to about 17psu, with a mean value of about 7.5psu (Bales and Robbins, 1995). Soils in the floodplain of the non-tidal portion of Bath Creek are poorly to very poorly drained mucky peats and loam (Kirby, 1995). Fine sandy loams that are poorly to somewhat poorly drained are present in a band approximately 600m wide on both sides of the tidal portion of Bath Creek and along some small streams that drain to the tidal creek. Most of the basin, however, is underlain by fine loam to sandy loam that is very poorly drained. As a result, much of the agricultural land in the basin is characterized by the presence of field ditches and canals that are used to lower the seasonally high water table in the spring. Overall land-surface slopes in the basin are very small, generally less than 1%. Agriculture accounts for approximately 29% of the total land use in Beaufort County (NCDACS, 2002). Forty percent of the agricultural land in the county is used for corn production, and more corn is produced in Beaufort County than in any other county in the state (NCDACS, 2002). Other important crops grown in the area include soybeans, cotton, and wheat. The average size of the 395 farms in the county is 162ha, with 90% of the farms family owned. The most commonly applied pesticides in this region include the herbicides atrazine and metolachlor, which are also among the most frequently detected pesticides in the waters of the Tar-Pamlico River Basin. For example, the annual rate of detection for atrazine in surface waters of the Tar-Pamlico Basin during 1992\u20132001, ranged from 38 to 92%; metolachlor was detected in 73 to 100% of the total annual surface water samples during the same period (Woodside and Ruhl, 2001; McCarthy, 2002). Estimates of pesticide use for Beaufort County indicate that more than 1230kg of active ingredient of atrazine and 902kg of active ingredient of metolachlor were applied annually in the region during the period of our study (NCDACS, 2002). For these reasons, atrazine and metolachlor data were used to test the performance of the model in Bath Creek. 2.2 Sample collection and analysis Twelve water samples were collected from a small boat over a 5-day period, following a rain event on 10 July 2002. Sampling was conducted within 24h after rainfall initiation and during the first event after herbicide application. Samples were collected at approximately the middle depth of the water column by lowering a 500mL Teflon\u00ae-stoppered amber glass bottle and allowing it fill at the desired depth. Transects from shoreline-to-shoreline were made at the head of the bay, middle of the bay and mouth of the bay (Fig. 1 ). Triplicate samples were collected at six equidistant locations along each transect and the six samples were composited to yield three replicates samples for analysis at each sampling time. Samples were composited into a 4L amber glass bottle, placed on ice, and filtered within 24h of collection. Samples were pre-filtered with glass microfiber filters (Whatman, GF/B, 1\u03bcm pore size) and nylon filters (Osmonics Inc., 0.45\u03bcm pore size) to remove particulates. Solid phase extraction with Empore C-18 Extraction disks (3M-Company, 47mm diameter) was used to extract all filtered water samples. Sample volumes were measured and spiked with surrogate internal standard (diazinon d10) prior to extraction. C-18 Empore extraction disks were conditioned using ethyl acetate and methanol. Samples were extracted using the Empore C18 extraction method described by Mueller et al. (2000). Extracts were concentrated under N2 gas. Samples were analyzed in the North Carolina State University, Department of Environmental and Molecular Toxicology, Analytical Toxicology Laboratory by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) with the method described by Zaugg et al. (1995). Sample extracts were analyzed using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) connected to an Agilent 5973N MSD utilizing a Restek 30m\u00d70.25mm Rtx-5 (film thickness 0.25\u03bcm) MS w/Integra-Guard column. The pressure was ramped to 40psi before injection with a 1min hold time. The flow was then dropped to give a constant flow of 1mL/min for the duration of the run. The temperature program for pesticide analysis was as follows: initial temperature 40\u00b0C for 1min with a ramp of 6\u00b0C/min to 290\u00b0C and a final hold time of 30min; injector temperature 300\u00b0C, detector temperature 280\u00b0C. The MS was operated in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Field and procedural blanks were run with the samples to determine background contamination present in the materials or introduced during extraction and cleanup. No pesticides were detected in any of the blanks. Recoveries of surrogate internal standards ranged from 84 to 102%. Data were not corrected for surrogate recoveries. Blank spike recoveries also were very good, yielding values from 87 to 98%. Precision was assessed through the analysis of field duplicate samples; the relative percent difference between field duplicates was always less than 10%. 2.3 Steady-state EXAMS model The first stage of the project involved the development of a simple steady-state EXAMS model for the Bath Creek system. The EXAMS model is an interactive modeling system designed by the USEPA that is used to conduct rapid evaluations and error analyses of the probable aquatic fate of synthetic organic chemicals (Burns, 2000). The model combines chemical loadings, transport, and transformation into a set of differential equations using conservation of mass as an accounting principle. The model accounts for the interactions among the aquatic environment, the properties of the chemical of interest, and environmental loading characteristics to predict exposure, persistence, and fate of chemicals (Siewicki, 1997). The four-compartment Bath Creek model included two benthic compartments and two water compartments (Fig. 2 ; Tables 1 and 2 ). Pesticide concentrations were assumed to be uniform throughout a single compartment, but can be in both the dissolved and adsorbed phase within a compartment. The primary water input influencing residence time in this model was stream flow into the littoral zone, which was used to simulate a measured 3.2-day residence time of water in the estuary. Thus, we forced EXAMS to account for tidal flushing by artificially increasing stream flow (30.9m3/s, Table 1) to approximate the measured estuary residence time. In comparison, recent measurements by our laboratory yielded a flow range of approximately 0.6\u20131.4m3/s during normal late spring and summer flow periods with an average of 1.01m3/s. Freshwater stream flow accounts for only 3% of total flow in this tidally dominated estuary. For the purposes of this model, we assumed that the pesticides entered Bath Creek directly from non-point source runoff and stream flow load. An ongoing study indicates that pesticide input from groundwater and precipitation is negligible, based on measured concentrations of atrazine and metolachlor below 10ng/L (unpublished data). This same study has demonstrated that runoff from agricultural fields following the first significant rain event in this watershed contains between 3 and 10% of the applied mass of atrazine and metolachlor. This range of herbicide input was used for our modeling and is further supported by work of Southwick et al. (2003), who conducted a study of atrazine and metolachlor in surface runoff in southern Louisiana, and found runoff losses of 5.2\u201310.8% for atrazine and 3.7\u20138.0% for metolachlor. However, many factors, including water management characteristics and time from application to rainfall, can affect pesticide losses (Gaynor et al., 2002). Measured concentrations of atrazine and metolachlor from previous studies conducted throughout the Tar-Pamlico River Basin (Woodside and Simerl, 1996; Woodside and Ruhl, 2001; Spruill et al., 1998; Skrobialowski, 1996) formed the empirical basis for choosing these herbicides. These earlier data were augmented with measurements of atrazine and metolachlor in Bath Creek during 2000\u20132002 (McCarthy, 2002) for comparison to the concentrations predicted by the EXAMS steady-state model. 2.4 Tidal EXAMS model The steady-state EXAMS model does not allow for temporal changes in flow and water volume resulting from tidal fluctuations, and consequently the effects of these changes on pesticide transport are not properly simulated for tidally influenced waterbodies. As a result, a second EXAMS model was developed to include tidal fluctuations. A five-compartment model was developed that included a hypolimnion to account for incoming (or flood) flows associated with a rising tide (Fig. 3 ). Moreover, the hypolimnion can be used in conjunction with the epilimnion to simulate two-layer stratification in estuarine systems. Based on salinity-depth profiles in Bath Creek, the depth of the epilimnion was assumed to be twice that of the hypolimnion at all times. Tides were simulated by changing the area, depth and volume of the water in the system on an hourly basis, using mode 2 of the EXAMS program. During ebb flow, water enters the system as stream flow into the littoral compartment and pesticide input as a non-point source load (Fig. 3A). The freshwater inflow rate for the tidal model was considerably less than the steady-state model (Table 1) because the temporal volume modifications accounted for tidal flushing and did not require an artificial change in stream flow to balance the water mass and yield the correct residence time. This modification also provided a more realistic temporal depiction of tidal water movement and flushing in the system at an hourly time resolution. We also assumed that the water depth in the modeled reach decreased at a steady rate (0.05m/h) during ebb flow, resulting in a 0.3m total change in depth from high tide to low tide. The area of the littoral zone was thereby reduced during the period of ebb flow. The depth of the littoral zone was assumed to increase at a steady rate from 0m at the shoreline to a maximum depth of 1.4m at the interface with the epilimnion. A calculated change of 1.65\u00d7105 m2 in surface area would then be associated with every 0.05m change in depth. The depth of the littoral zone was constant at 0.7m in the steady-state model. Additional chemical and water inputs were added to the model for the 6h duration of flood flow (Fig. 3B). During this period, water entered the system through the littoral zone (stream flow) and the hypolimnion (Pamlico River inflow to Bath Creek, shown as estuary inflow and load in Fig. 2). The magnitude of the stream flow into the littoral zone was the same for both flood and ebb flows. The stream flow was calculated by dividing the total change in water volume during the tidal cycle by the 6h period. We assumed that the flow rate remained constant over these 6h. Chemical measurements have shown that atrazine and metolachlor are frequently detected in the Pamlico River during the growing season. The mean concentrations of atrazine (35.6ng/L) and metolachlor (30.7ng/L) were determined during 2001 for a sampling site located in close proximity to Bath Creek (McCarthy, 2002) and converted to an input rate (kg/h). These values were then used as the Pamlico River pesticide load that entered Bath Creek through the hypolimnion and cycled through the epilimnion before exiting the system. Therefore, it was assumed that the pesticide load entering the hypolimnion during flood flow was carried in from an upstream source to the Pamlico River, and the pesticide that exited the system on the previous ebb flow was considered lost. 3 Results 3.1 Steady-state EXAMS model The EXAMS steady-state model simulated atrazine concentrations of 115 and 34ng/L for the 10 and 3% runoff loads, respectively. Simulated metolachlor concentrations were 187 and 56ng/L for the 10 and 3% runoff loads, respectively. As with any steady-state model, these results are based on the assumption of a constant input of pesticide to the system, which is clearly not the case for pesticide application followed by runoff from a rain event. Thus, we would expect the steady-state condition to (at best) represent only a short period following a pesticide application/rain event when there might be a relatively constant flux of pesticide to Bath Creek. It is not possible to predict a priori when or how long this period would exist. Subsequent pesticide measurements in Bath Creek following an application/rain event indicated that apparent concentration plateaus were reached within about 1 day of runoff for atrazine and 3 days for metolachlor (Fig. 4 ). Simulated atrazine and metolachlor concentrations using the steady-state EXAMS model are shown in Fig. 4, with the range representing our estimates of 3\u201310% of applied mass reaching Bath Creek; the mean value is the mid-point of the range. The steady-state simulations, in which loading is assumed to be constant, for atrazine are in reasonable agreement with measured concentrations for the mid bay transect. Differences between measured and simulated concentrations after about 60h are primarily of the difference between the assumed constant loading in the model and the actual rain event loading to the estuary. The steady-state EXAMS model assumes homogenous mixing for the entire epilimnion compartment, so the mid-bay measurements would represent the most appropriate values for comparison. Simulated metolachlor concentrations do not agree with measured values at the mid-bay transect as well as those for atrazine (Fig. 4); simulated concentrations agreed most closely with measurements made at the head of the bay. Measured metolachlor concentrations are about a factor of 2\u20133 higher in mid-bay samples than those simulated by the steady-state EXAMS model. We still consider this reasonable agreement considering the simplicity of the steady-state EXAMS model. 3.2 Tidal EXAMS model The constantly changing volume of the tidal model caused the predicted concentration of both atrazine and metolachlor to vary with time (Fig. 5 ). To generate the comparison of the tidal model to measured values shown in Fig. 4, a logarithmic fit to the data was made, using the average concentration in the entire water body, to smooth these tidal variations and make the comparison easier to visualize. As with the steady-state EXAMS model, two chemical input scenarios were used: 10 and 3% of the total mass of pesticide applied to the Bath Creek drainage basin. The tidal EXAMS model predicted concentrations of atrazine and metolachlor that were representative of the range of concentrations measured in Bath Creek, with very good agreement overall (Fig. 4). For atrazine, the model simulates an approach to steady-state after about 48h (Fig. 5) whereas the measurements indicate steady-state may be approached within 15\u201320h (Fig. 3A). After about 60h, the measurements showed a consistent decrease in atrazine concentrations throughout the bay. The model simulates a constant concentration at this point because of the assumption of a constant input from agricultural fields. This obviously is an invalid assumption beyond a few days after the runoff event, although the time at which concentrations depart from steady-state likely depend on application rate, rainfall, and the residence time of water in system, and possibly other factors. Metolachlor simulations did not indicate that steady-state would be reached within the time frame modeled following the beginning of runoff (Fig. 5). Measurements of metolachlor concentrations in Bath Creek are consistent with this prediction of a longer time to reach a steady-state concentration compared to atrazine (Fig. 4). As was the case with atrazine, there is not a constant source load of metolachlor to the bay so the measured plateaus are likely a result of decreasing concentrations of metolachlor in runoff water as metolachlor leaches from the agricultural field, whereas the steady-state simulated by the model is the result of a balance between inputs and losses for the case of a constant source. Atrazine apparently is transported to the estuary more rapidly than metolachlor, so steady-state concentrations of atrazine are observed sooner after the runoff event than is the case for metolachlor. The difference in response time for the two herbicides is illustrated in Fig. 6 where the total mass of each herbicide in Bath Creek simulated using the tidal EXAMS model (10% input) is shown as a function of time. The model assumes a continuous input of each chemical and atrazine reaches steady-state more rapidly than metolachlor. Atrazine has a much lower octanol\u2013water partitioning coefficient and leaches more rapidly from the organic rich soils in the area than metolachlor, leading to more rapid loss from the agricultural field and a shorter time to reach steady-state\u2014assuming constant input. When cessation of the source is simulated at 260h, atrazine is also depleted much more rapidly than metolachlor (Fig. 6 ). This is due in part to the lower octanol\u2013water partition coefficient for atrazine; there is more atrazine in water and less on particles compared to metolachlor, and water has a shorter residence time in the estuary than particles. Atrazine also has a much shorter half-life in water than metolachlor, so the atrazine that does remain in the bay degrades more quickly than metolachlor. 4 Discussion We found that the steady-state EXAMS model provided reasonably accurate estimates of metolachlor concentrations in Bath Creek and very good (predictions generally within the range of measurements) agreement with measured atrazine concentrations. The tidal EXAMS model provided slightly better results overall, with more accurate estimates for metolachlor than the steady-state model and slight overestimates for atrazine. The obvious advantage of the tidal EXAMS model is the ability to more explicitly account for tidal influences at any selected time resolution. In systems with tidal amplitudes larger than that in Bath Creek, the advantages of the tidal EXAMS model over the steady-state model may be more pronounced. Neither model was particularly user friendly, compared to models such as the Mackay-type multimedia fugacity models (Mackay, 2004). A significant effort was required to learn and apply the EXAMS model. The tidal model also introduced complexity to the modeling, requiring the development of a series of commands that could be executed repeatedly to account for changes in water level and volume. Transfer of model results to standard plotting packages also was difficult. The EXAMS steady-state model seems preferable for application to the Bath Creek watershed compared to some other available models. For example, the groundwater loading effects of agricultural management systems (GLEAMS) model and the pesticide root zone model (PRZM) are two of the most commonly used pesticide fate models. The GLEAMS model predicts runoff, percolation and soil and chemical losses of a nutrient or pesticide at the edge of a field and from the root zone (Shirmohammadi and Knisel, 1994; Rekolainen et al., 2000). GLEAMS, however, can overpredict pesticide concentrations when used to simulate an entire watershed, rather than a field. The PRZM is a field scale model that was designed to simulate pesticide transport and transformation through the root zone (Smith et al., 1991). It was designed as a one-dimensional model and not intended to evaluate lateral movement of a chemical (Trevisan et al., 2000). Other models, like the Hydrological Simulation Program FORTRAN (HSPF) model, were developed to simulate runoff and transport of pesticides and nutrients from urban and agricultural watersheds (Laroche et al., 1996). The main disadvantage of this model is that it tends to overestimate the concentration of a chemical in the watershed. The magnitude of the overestimation often depends on the type of pesticide and size of the watershed (Laroche et al., 1996). The steady-state EXAMS model does not have a mechanism to allow for changing water flow or chemical loads with time. Because of the need to account for the temporary input of pesticides during flood flow into an embayment from a source at the mouth of the embayment, the EXAMS tidal model most accurately depicts the tidally driven hydrodynamics that are associated with estuaries. We modified the EXAMS tidal model to simulate the chemical movement into an estuary that was affected by tides, in which the volume and area fluctuated with the tide. We found that measured atrazine and metolachlor concentrations in Bath Creek following rainfall and subsequent runoff were well predicted by the modified model. In addition, the EXAMS tidal model predicted that atrazine reached equilibrium in the system in approximately 20h, whereas model simulations were terminated (at 264h) before metolachlor achieved equilibrium. Pesticide input into a system is generally episodic (Southwick et al., 2003) with peak inputs corresponding to the pesticide application periods and subsequent rainfall and runoff. The EXAMS tidal model provided the ability to determine how changes in the incoming chemical load, both increases and decreases, affect the concentrations of the chemical in the water column. In addition to a change in the total mass, that is dependent on the chemical input to the system, the tidal model provided information on how the changing water volume, associated with the tidal cycle, affects the pesticide concentration. A number of the environmental parameters are important for the EXAMS modeling system to accurately predict environmental concentrations of pesticides. One such parameter not originally included in the model, however, is tidal range. Including this parameter in our modified model improved the accuracy of the model for predicting atrazine and metolachlor concentrations in the Bath Creek estuary system of North Carolina. Tidal range can influence the concentrations observed during the tidal cycle; for example, as the tidal range increased from 0.3 to 1m, the predicted concentration of the pesticide increased. This occurrence was attributed to the change in volume because a larger tidal range results in a smaller water volume in the system at low tide than would be exhibited with a smaller tidal range. In the case of Bath Creek, tides are not purely astronomical but are associated with wind effects on Pamlico River. Consequently, the uniform 0.3m tide imposed on the Bath Creek model was a simplification of conditions that actually occurred during the July 2002 event. Nevertheless, the model performed quite well with the simplified tide conditions. Numerous other estuarine hydrologic and mixing models have been designed to predict the fate of nutrients or metals and to simulate changes in parameters such as salinity and dissolved oxygen. Most of the models are extremely complex and often designed for a single estuarine system. Models such as the nitrogen loading model (NLM) and the estuarine loading model (ELM) were designed to predict the fate of nutrients in estuaries in general, whereas the Cape Cod Commission model (CCC) and the Buzzard Bay Project model (BBP) were both created to predict the fate of nitrogen in specific estuaries in Massachusetts (Eichner and Cambareri, 1992; Costa et al., 1999; Valiela et al., 1997, 2002). Few models, however, have been designed to model the fate of pesticides in estuaries. The Chesapeake Bay estuary model package (CBEMP) simulates dissolved oxygen concentrations as a function of temperature, wind mixing, water current advection, and various chemical and biological processes (Wang et al., 2001). The Chesapeake Bay is a well-characterized estuary and data for such variables are readily available for this system. This type of detailed information is not available for a large proportion of the smaller estuaries in the United States. Simpler models that require less environmental data are useful for estimating order-of-magnitude concentrations of pesticides and other contaminants in smaller estuaries. A few studies have evaluated the EXAMS model in estuarine systems, or in systems analogous to estuaries, for various contaminants and results have been mixed. For example, Siewicki (1997) used EXAMS to model the fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a segment of Murrells Inlet estuary in South Carolina. Because EXAMS was formulated to simulate the steady (time invariant) flow of water, sediment, and plankton, certain assumptions were required to apply the model to a dynamic estuarine system. These assumptions included an average water depth based on mid-tide water level, steady flow, an estimated and constant dispersion coefficient, and an average resuspension rate of bottom sediments. With these assumptions, the model predicted sediment concentrations of PAHs that were within 30% of those measured in the inlet. Kolset and Heiberg (1988) used EXAMS and the fugacity equilibrium model (FEQUM), which is an extended version of the fugacity models developed by Mackay (2004) and others to simulate fate and transport of kraft mill effluent in a coastal bay in Sweden. Among other characteristics, FEQUM differs from EXAMS in that it includes a more flexible description of the flow field, with advective flows beginning or terminating in any of the system compartments. Kolset and Heiberg (1988) used water flow rates, assumed to be steady, between compartments as the primary calibration parameter (i.e., flows were adjusted to achieve the best agreement between simulations and measurements). Sato and Schnoor (1991) used three chemical fate models \u2013 the simplified lake and stream analysis (HydroQual, 1981), EXAMS, and TOXIC (Schnoor and McAvoy, 1981) \u2013 to simulate the fate of dieldrin in a flood control reservoir in Iowa. Reservoirs are analogous to estuaries in that density stratification plays a key role in both transport and biogeochemical processes, and flows are unsteady. Sato and Schnoor (1991) divided the study reservoir into various water compartments; the riverine portion of the reservoir was one compartment and the lacustrine portion of the reservoir was represented by two layers. Average annual flow, suspended sediment, and dieldrin loading rates were provided as reservoir inflows. The three models predicted concentrations of dieldrin in the water column that were within a standard deviation of the measured concentrations from the reservoir. Mossman and Mulki (1996) also simulated pesticide (alachlor, atrazine, metolachlor, and metribuzin) transport in a reservoir by using a one-dimensional unsteady flow model. Such an approach does not account for vertical differences in pesticide concentrations. Simulations were made at 1-day intervals, which are not sufficient for tidal conditions. Mossman and Mulki (1996) found that pesticide concentrations at the outlet of the reservoir were dominated by advective processes and that simulations were more sensitive to transport parameters than reaction kinetics. Many complex processes that affect pesticide behavior in estuaries are less important in freshwater systems. For example, most of the pesticides entering San Francisco Bay were associated with suspended sediments following the first major storm of the year, whereas pesticide occurrence and concentrations in water samples were low (Bergamaschi et al., 2001). This transport process may reflect long equilibrium times on the land surface following pesticide application and relatively short transit times between the source and estuary, resulting in insufficient time for re-equilibration. Such processes are difficult to include in pesticide fate and transport models, particularly in the absence of site-specific data, but could be important in selected settings. The Bath Creek application also did not explicitely account for vertical or longitudinal salinity gradients, although the two layers (Fig. 3) did qualitatively represent two-layer flow that occur in estuaries because of salinity gradients. There is some indication that atrazine transformation products are more readily formed in higher salinity (greater than 15psu) waters than in the lower salinity portion of the estuary (Steen et al., 2000), although the correlation of salinity with other factors such as turbidity and dissolved oxygen may mask the true cause for the increased rate of transformation-product formation. Any estuarine pesticide fate and transport model would ideally have the capability to simulate the unsteady flow processes associated with time variable inflows, tides, and wind. Moreover, longitudinal and vertical salinity gradients that govern transport and mixing processes and influence some chemical transformations because of spatial and temporal variations in ionic strength and turbidity should also be accounted for in models. Because of the large size of some estuarine systems, lateral heterogeneities should also not be ignored. Although we could not account for all of these complex estuarine hydrodynamics in the Bath Creek estuary, our modified EXAMS model provided a very reasonable prediction of pesticide concentration. 5 Conclusion Estuaries are important breeding and nursery habitats for a large number of estuarine and marine species. These organisms are often found in the shallow waters along the edge of the estuary. Chemical input into these areas, along with the shallower water, can result in higher concentrations of contaminants in these areas. Therefore, understanding and modeling the potential effects of chemical contaminants (Hyland et al., 1999; Kiddon et al., 2003), and their transport and fate (Hapeman et al., 2003) into these systems is critical to assessing risks of chemical releases to estuarine ecosystems. The modified EXAMS models employed here allow for the modeling of pesticide fate and exposure in estuaries as simple homogenously mixed systems at steady-state or as higher resolution segmented systems under non-steady-state conditions. The capacity of the EXAMS model to be subdivided into numerous compartments within the same waterbody enables the user to design a model environment that is as complex as required to accurately depict variation within the waterbody or complex hydrodynamics of the system. In the small and shallow Bath Creek estuary studied here, relatively simple steady-state and time-variant EXAMS models accurately predicted herbicide fate and exposure. This work is evidence that the modified EXAMS models could be used to predict chemical fate and exposure, and thus chemical risk, to the hundreds of similar small estuarine ecosystems throughout the United States and elsewhere. This is a significant improvement and expansion of EXAMS, and given the wide use of EXAMS for surface water quality modeling by both researchers and regulators and the ability of EXAMS to interface with terrestrial models (e.g., PRZM) and bioaccumulation models, we now have an easily-accessible and widely accepted means of modeling chemical fate in estuaries. Finally, in addition to the evaluation and discussion of the pesticide-related models presented previously, a thorough search of Ecological Modelling and other relevant journals revealed that many other models are available for estuarine (Park et al., 1998; J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2002; H\u00e5kanson et al., 2004; Fulton et al., 2004a,b; Zheng et al., 2004; Shen, 2006; Sheldon and Alber, 2006) and pesticide (Carsel et al., 1985; Mossman and Mulki, 1996; Gyldenkaerne and J\u00f8rgensen, 2000; Bergamaschi et al., 2001) applications. However, to our knowledge, none currently exist that specifically link pesticide fate and transport in an estuarine system to tidal fluctuations, as was done in this study. Therefore, this study provides new knowledge about modeling pesticides in tidally influenced ecosystems that provides researchers and resource managers with a new tool in risk assessment.
