Highlights \u2022 The proposed model in this study estimates reasonably well pedestrian delay for street crossing in an urban setting with platooned traffic stream and observed driver yield behavior. \u2022 A generalized method is provided to mathematically estimate the pedestrian delay, without restricting the model to a particular vehicle headway distribution or driver yield behavior assumptions.

Abstract Delay is an important performance measure for pedestrian crossings considering their interactions with other road users. This study provides an improved analytical model to mathematically estimate pedestrian delay using renewal theory, which considers driver yielding and vehicle platooning. A generalized model is first provided to accommodate different traffic flow and driver behavior assumptions. Then the proposed model is developed on the basis of a mixture of free traffic and platooned traffic with consideration of driver yielding behaviors to better replicate field conditions in an urban setting. A second application using the HCM 2010 assumptions is also derived to compare it to the HCM 2010 model. Lastly, field data were collected and used for validation from two locations: Gainesville, FL and Washington, D.C. A simulation via MATLAB is performed to evaluate the model results for a variety of cases. The comparisons to the field data as well as the simulation confirm the applicability and accuracy of the proposed model. It is also found that the current HCM 2010 model overestimates the pedestrian delay compared with field data. Keywords Pedestrian delay Renewal theory Urban networks 1 Introduction Pedestrian street crossing leads to direct interactions with motor vehicles and other road users. Pedestrian crossing at unsignalized intersections can be simply deconstructed as follows: A pedestrian arrives at an unsignalized intersection and desires to cross the major traffic stream. If the vehicle-pedestrian gap\u03b81 (i.e., the time headway between the pedestrian arrival and the vehicle arrival) is larger than the pedestrian's critical gap\u03c4(which is equal to the minimum time to cross the road), the pedestrian crosses the street immediately; if not, the pedestrian waits, and the crossing probability depends on the driver yield behavior. A schematic of this problem is shown in Fig. 1 as a time-space diagram. Vehicle trajectories are presented (\u03b8 i is the time headway between vehicle i and i + 1). Pedestrians randomly arrive (at time t) at the curb and make a crossing decision immediately. The wait time at the curb (i.e., the time difference between pedestrian arrival t and departure t\u2019) is defined as the pedestrian delay for street crossing. Pedestrian delay is often used as a performance measure for quantitatively evaluating the pedestrian-vehicle interactions, as well as estimating the facility Level of Service (HCM, 2010). It is highly dependent on vehicular traffic (Adams, 1936; Mayne, 1954; Troutbeck, 1986; Schroeder et al., 2014), road geometry (Dunn and Pretty, 1984; Troutbeck, 1986), and pedestrian behavior (Sun et al., 2003; Schroeder and Rouphail, 2010b; Schroeder et al., 2014). The first pedestrian delay model was developed by William Adams in 1936 (Adams, 1936), and has been expanded/modified by various researchers (Tanner, 1951; Mayne, 1954; Underwood, 1961; Cowan, 1975; Troutbeck, 1986, etc.). The early models adopted simple vehicle headway distributions and ignored vehicle yield behaviors. A few other researchers explored this problem by considering it as a stochastic process (Weiss and Maradudin, 1962; Heidemann and Wegmann, 1997). Recent pedestrian delay studies focused on calibrating and modifying the previous models for different traffic scenarios (Guo et al., 2004; Schroeder and Rouphail, 2010b; Vasconcelos et al., 2012), such as two-stage crossing, pulsed traffic caused by signals, etc. The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2010 improved Adams\u2019 model (1936) with adding the assumption of constant vehicle yield rate for estimating pedestrian delay (HCM, 2010). However, those existing models may not sufficiently capture the realistic pedestrian street crossing behavior at unsignalized intersections in urban networks. Particularly, findings from observational studies, have identified factors such as platooned traffic flow pattern (Bowman and Vecellio, 1994; Sisiopiku and Akin, 2003; Avineri et al., 2012; Schroeder et al., 2014), driver yielding behavior (Sun et al., 2003; Schroeder, 2008), and pedestrian yield recognition (Schroeder, 2008; Schroeder et al., 2014), that have great importance and should be considered in the pedestrian delay model. The existing models are missing those and may not perform well in estimating pedestrian delay in cases of high-level pedestrian activities, such as in major city CBD areas, campus areas, etc. The objective of this study is to propose a generalized mathematical model of pedestrian delay for crossing a traffic stream at unsignalized intersections, and based on that to address driver yielding and platooned vehicular traffic conditions in urban networks. The model is developed using Renewal Theory, which solves this problem in a more direct way as a stochastic process and provides possibilities for future model expansion. Firstly, a generalized model is developed to be applied with any vehicle headway distribution or driver yield behavior assumptions (solving a G/G/1 queuing system). Then the proposed model is applied on the basis of a mixture of free traffic and platooned traffic with consideration of driver yielding behaviors to replicate field conditions. A special case adopting the HCM 2010 assumptions is also derived as a comparison with the HCM 2010 model. Next, the model was compared to field data. A total of 110 pedestrian crossing events in Gainesville, Florida, as well as 99 pedestrian crossing events in Washington, D.C., were used in the comparison. An expanded validation using simulation was also employed to evaluate the model results under a broad set of parameters. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of previous research on pedestrian delay and pedestrian street crossing behavior (with related vehicle interactions). Section 3 discusses the model assumptions and variable definitions. Section 4 discusses renewal theory and provides the model formulation and the two application cases. Section 5 presents the field data collection procedure and the model results. Section 6 provides the stochastic simulation and model validation results. Conclusions and recommendations are provided in the last section. 2 Literature review An overview of previous research on pedestrian delay models is provided in this section. Existing studies on pedestrian street crossing behavior (with related vehicle interactions) are also reviewed to provide the basic assumptions for the proposed pedestrian delay model in this study. 2.1 Pedestrian delay models The first pedestrian delay model at unsignalized intersections was proposed by Adams in 1936 in one of the earliest theoretical traffic papers (Adams, 1936). The gap-acceptance method was applied and he assumed that vehicles and pedestrians arrive randomly, and both behave consistently. The pedestrian will accept the gap if and only if the vehicle-pedestrian gap is larger than the critical gap; otherwise, he/she will stay and wait for another acceptable gap. Tanner (1951) extended Adam's model and conducted a comprehensive study of pedestrian delay for street crossings (Tanner, 1951). He also assumed random arrival of vehicles and pedestrians, but he further considered non-uniform critical gaps for different pedestrians and considered the distribution of pedestrian group size (in the case of pedestrian crossing in groups). Most of the early models are called M1 models, since they all shared a common assumption: the vehicle arrivals follow the Poisson distribution (vehicle headways are distributed as negative exponential). As noted in other studies (Troutbeck and Brilon, 1997), the Poisson distribution predicts too small headways. The shifted exponential distribution was proposed instead, which assumed a minimum headway\u03c1(M2 model), to overcome that drawback. However, this approach didn't capture the case of vehicles travelling in a group (platoon). In 1975, Cowan developed the M3 model which considered a combination of \u201ctracking\u201d vehicles and \u201cfree\u201d vehicles (Cowan, 1975). The platoon size was assumed to follow the geometric distribution. This model offered a realistic arrival assumption for stochastic modeling. Troutbeck estimated the average delay at an unsignalized intersection with two major streams based on the M3 model and indicated that the platoon size did have a major impact on average delay and degree of saturation of the minor stream (pedestrian departure) (Troutbeck, 1986). Akcelik and Chung in 1994 compared the M1, M2 and M3 models with field data from single-lane traffic and simulation data from multi-lane traffic (Akcelik and Chung, 1994). They recommended the M3 model for general use in traffic modeling. Mayne (1954) generalized Tanner's model (1951) and considered a general distribution for vehicle headways. Guo et al. (2004) proposed a pedestrian delay model with pulsed traffic flow caused by traffic signals. He assumed that each arriving pedestrian will face one of the following possible scenarios: a bunched flow with no suitable gap to cross, a flow where vehicles travel randomly (there may be gaps to cross), and a clearance time (larger than the pedestrian critical gap) where all the waiting pedestrians can cross. The model was based on pre-timed isolated signals with the bunched flow starting at the beginning of the equivalent green time and the clearance time equivalent to signal lost time. We did not find any analytical models in the literature that consider driver yielding possibilities (i.e., they assumed the pedestrians only cross in gaps) which may significantly affect the pedestrian delay. The HCM 2010 provides a method to estimate pedestrian delay for major street crossings at two-way-stop-controlled intersections (HCM, 2010). It assumes random pedestrian arrivals, random vehicle arrivals, and equal distribution of traffic volume on all through lanes of both directions. The pedestrian delay is divided in two parts: gap delay (when pedestrians cross during an available gap) and yield delay (when pedestrians cross during a vehicle yield). The average delay is thus calculated as the sum of the products of each delay with the corresponding probability. The HCM 2010 in essence applies Adam's model (1936) for the gap delay estimation, while assuming independent vehicle yielding and constant yield rate for the yield delay estimation (HCM, 2010). There are some studies using renewal theory to address the pedestrian delay problems at two-way-stop-controlled intersections (Weiss and Maradudin, 1962; Heidemann and Wegmann, 1997), single-lane roundabouts (Flannery et al., 2005). Renewal theory is a branch of probability theory that generalizes stochastic processes. The mean and variance of the queueing delay can be estimated from the models. However, some of the studies were validated to perform well only under certain conditions. For example, the model by Flannery et al. (2005) was validated to perform well only under moderate circulating steam flow rates. Weiss and Maradudin (1962) assumed vehicle arrivals along the major street are uncorrelated, with a known probability distribution function, and the pedestrian crossing probability (gap acceptance) is a known function. Based on renewal theory, a general form of pedestrian delay distribution was developed as a convolution integral equation, and the moments were found by Laplace transformation. Their results could be further expanded to address other problems in traffic delay, such as impatient pedestrians whose gap acceptance depends on the passage of major-street vehicles, correlated vehicle gaps by using the theory of semi-Markov process, etc. Driver yielding behavior was not covered in this study. Heidemann and Wegmann (1997) applied the M/G2/1 queuing model and generalized several mathematical results for queuing problems at unsignalized intersections, such as queue length, delay, capacity, etc. This model also applied renewal theory for analyzing the queuing system at unsignalized intersections, but the inter-arrival distribution was required to be negative exponential. 2.2 Pedestrian street crossing and driver yielding behaviors Findings from pedestrian crossing behavior studies can provide the assumptions for developing pedestrian delay models. Previous research has found that pedestrians are more likely to cross the street at designated facilities (Dunn and Pretty, 1984; Sisiopiku and Akin, 2003; Sun et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2015) and the average crossing speed was found to be 4ft/s for the general population (HCM, 2010). Pedestrian street crossing behavior can be regarded as a pedestrian gap acceptance problem, where the vehicle-pedestrian gap is a good indicator that captures the interaction distance between the approaching vehicle and waiting pedestrian. The pedestrian crossing decision has been found to be highly dependent on the distance, as well as the driver yielding decision and the vehicle speed (Dunn and Pretty, 1984; Sun et al., 2003; Schroeder, 2008; Schroeder et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2015). Driver yield behavior is an important factor and has been frequently observed when interacting with street-crossing pedestrians (Sun et al., 2003; Schroeder, 2008; Salamati et al., 2013). The yield rate varies among different conditions. For example, it was found that the drivers were more likely to yield with low vehicle travelling speed (Schroeder and Rouphail, 2010a; Salamati et al., 2011), and in an environment with higher pedestrian activities (Schroeder and Rouphail, 2010a; Zheng et al., 2015); these factors all affect/relate to the vehicle-pedestrian gap \u2013 the driver yield rate is a function of that gap. However, most of the previous pedestrian delay models ignored the driver yielding behavior (Adams, 1936; Mayne, 1954; Weiss and Maradudin, 1962; Troutbeck and Brilon, 1997); those which considered the yielding possibility, ignored it if the vehicle is travelling in a platoon, and assumed pedestrians need to wait for an entire vehicle platoon for crossing (Guo et al., 2004; Wei et al., 2013). Based on the literature review, we can conclude that typically the pedestrian delay has been modeled using M/M/1 and M/G/1 queuing systems. The literature indicates that it is highly affected by vehicular traffic, driver yield behavior, pedestrian critical gap, pedestrian volume, and road geometry. But the previous models cannot be applied to estimate the pedestrian delay at unsignalized intersections in an urban setting when vehicles are travelling in platoons, and yield events are commonly observed due to high pedestrian volumes. This paper proposes a theoretical model for estimating pedestrian delay for street crossing in that setting using renewal theory. 3 Model assumptions and variable definitions This study provides a mathematical approach of estimating pedestrian delay for street crossing at unsignalized intersections in urban networks. The interaction between the waiting pedestrian and the first approaching vehicle is considered. Once the vehicle passes the pedestrian crossing location (i.e. the pedestrian fails to cross), a new interaction arises between this pedestrian with the next approaching vehicle. In practice, the driver yielding behavior, as well as pedestrian crossing and yielding recognition behaviors are affected by a number of factors such as vehicle speed, number of waiting pedestrians, previous vehicle behavior (Sun et al., 2003; Salamati et al., 2013; Schroeder et al., 2014), especially in the cases of high pedestrian or vehicle demands. However, these factors are very difficult to pre-specify, and there are no models that provide confirmed methodologies for their prediction. With that in mind, in our study, we assumed independent vehicle-pedestrian interactions. For each pedestrian-vehicle interaction, the pedestrian encounters one of the three scenarios shown in Table 1 and experiences the corresponding pedestrian delay. The model assumptions are as follows: \u2022 Pedestrians are crossing one traffic stream (one-lane crossing or multiple-lane traffic is considered as one stream). \u2022 Pedestrian behaviors are consistent and homogeneous: identical critical gap\u03c4(crosswalk length divided by cross speed); pedestrian gap acceptance rate= 100%, if pedestrian-vehicle gap\u2265 \u03c4; pedestrian yield acceptance rate= 100%, if vehicle yields. \u2022 Upon arrival at the curb, the pedestrian immediately makes a crossing decision. \u2022 Vehicle headways \u03b81, \u03b82, ..., \u03b8 i are independent, identically distributed random variables with probability density function. \u2022 Vehicle yield probability is a function of the corresponding vehicle-pedestrian gap. \u25cb Vehicles will not be able to yield if the gap is less than the safely-yielding time distance \u03b8 s (\u03b8 s is determined by the vehicle speed and maximum braking deceleration rate); \u25cb Vehicles will yield with a probability of y (constant, no more than 1), if the gap is between the vehicle minimum headway \u03b8 s and pedestrian critical gap \u03c4. \u2022 Each vehicle-pedestrian interaction is independent. \u2022 Vehicles and pedestrians are treated as points, without considering vehicle length or pedestrian body width. The variable definitions and notations are as follows: ti Pedestrian arriving time for pedestrian i (sec) t i \u2032 Pedestrian departing time for pedestrian i (sec) \u03b8 i Vehicle headway for vehicle i (sec) \u03b81 Distance between the pedestrian and the closest approaching vehicle (sec) \u03c4 Pedestrian critical gap (sec) \u03bb Vehicle arrival rate (veh/sec) \u03b8 s Vehicle safely-yielding distance (sec) (i.e., the minimum distance for making a safe stop) X Pedestrian reaction time to driver yields (sec) \u03c1 Vehicle headway for platooned traffic (sec) (Cowan M3) \u03b1 Proportion of free traffic (Cowan M3) \u03a6(\u03b8 i ) Probability density function of vehicle headways Y(\u03b8 i ) Probability density function of vehicle yield rate (1) Y ( \u03b8 i ) = { 0 \u03b8 i < \u03b8 s y \u03b8 s < \u03b8 i < \u03c4 g(\u03b8 i ) Probability that the pedestrian accepts the vehicle-pedestrian gap (2) g ( \u03b8 i ) = { 0 \u03b8 i < \u03c4 1 \u03b8 i > \u03c4 \u039b(\u03b8) Probability that the pedestrian crosses the street \u039b \u00af 1 Probability of accepting the first vehicle-pedestrian lag (3) \u039b \u00af 1 = \u222b 0 \u221e \u039b ( \u03b8 1 ) \u03d5 ( \u03b8 1 ) d \u03b8 1 \u039b \u00af Probability of accepting the next vehicle-pedestrian gap (4) \u039b \u00af = \u222b 0 \u221e \u039b ( \u03b8 ) \u03d5 ( \u03b8 ) d \u03b8 E(d) The expected pedestrian delay under renewal process (sec) E(d 2) The expected pedestrian delay under ordinary renewal process (sec) E(d|\u03b81) The wait time conditional on crossing in the first vehicle-pedestrian lag (sec) E(d 2|\u03b8) The wait time conditional on crossing in the next vehicle-pedestrian gaps (sec) E(dg ) The expected pedestrian gap delay under renewal process (sec) E(dy ) The expected pedestrian yield delay under renewal process (sec) 4 Model formulation Renewal theory is a branch of probability theory that generalizes stochastic processes. Renewal process is a counting process that captures the number of occurrences in a particular duration where the inter-arrival times between sequential occurrences are independent and identically distributed with an arbitrary distribution (Ross, 1996). It is usually applied to solve complicated cases that have randomly occurring events at which the system returns to a state probabilistically equivalent to the starting state (Gallager, 2013). The Poisson process is a special case of renewal process in which the inter-arrival times between renewals have an exponential distribution (Smith, 1958). A delayed renewal process represents the case when the first inter-arrival time has a different distribution than the rest of the inter-arrival times. In other words, the ordinary renewal process is delayed, i.e., it starts after the epoch of the first renewal. In terms of the pedestrian street crossing at unsignalized intersections in urban networks, it can be treated as a delayed renewal process with vehicle arrivals as random occurrences. Upon arrival, the time difference between the arrival of a pedestrian and the next vehicle is regarded as the first renewal, which may have different distributions from the rest of the vehicle headways. The distribution, moment function, as well as the mean and variance of pedestrian delay can be directly derived. We assume that the vehicular headway in the traffic stream is distributed with probability density function \u03a6(\u03b8). The pedestrian arrives at time t =0 and the time difference between the arriving pedestrian and the closest vehicle in the traffic stream is called \u201cvehicle-pedestrian lag\u201d. The lag has probability density function \u03a6(\u03b81). By renewal theory, the probability density of the first inter-arrival can be derived as follows (Weiss and Maradudin, 1962): (5) \u03d5 ( \u03b8 1 ) = 1 \u222b 0 \u221e \u03b8 \u03d5 ( \u03b8 ) d \u03b8 \u222b \u03b8 \u221e \u03d5 ( \u03b8 ) d \u03b8 A generalized model is first developed that can be applied to arbitrary vehicle headway distributions and vehicle yielding behavior assumptions, and then the proposed model for estimating pedestrian delay in urban networks is provided (assuming Cowan M3 for vehicular headway distribution, as it was recommended in the past studies for applying in urban networks (Akcelik and Chung, 1994; Vasconcelos et al., 2012)): \u2022 Platooned traffic flow is defined to occur when a vehicle follows another vehicle at a constant headway \u03c1. \u2022 Free flowing traffic is defined to occur when vehicles are travelling at headways larger than \u03c1. 4.1 Generalized model A generalized model is provided to accommodate different traffic conditions including any vehicle headway distributions, any assumptions of vehicle yielding behavior, pedestrian yield recognition behavior, and pedestrian gap acceptance behavior. The only assumption in this model is independent vehicle-pedestrian interaction. We define g(\u03b8) as the probability of pedestrian gap acceptance, which is a function of the corresponding vehicle-pedestrian gap. Then, the probability of pedestrian street crossing \u039b(\u03b8) is as follows: (6) \u039b ( \u03b8 ) = g ( \u03b8 ) \u222a Y ( \u03b8 ) We further define E(d) as the expected pedestrian delay time under this renewal process and define E(d 2) as the wait time for crossing under ordinary renewal process. E(d) is obtained by estimating the wait time conditional on crossing in the first vehicle-pedestrian lag (E(d|\u03b81)) and the wait time conditional on crossing in the subsequent gaps (E(d 2|\u03b8)). E(d|\u03b81) is estimated as the sum of the expected delay due to not crossing in the first vehicle-pedestrian lag (i.e., the expected wait time \u201c\u03b81 + E(d 2)\u201d multiplied by the corresponding probability of not crossing \u201c1\u2212\u039b(\u03b81)\u201d) and the wait time due to crossing in yield (i.e., \u201cX\u201d multiplied by the corresponding probability of driver yielding \u201cY(\u03b81)\u201d). E(d 2|\u03b8)is derived similarly. The estimations for E(d|\u03b81) and E(d 2|\u03b8) are as follows: (7) E ( d | \u03b8 1 ) = ( \u03b8 1 + E ( d 2 ) ) ( 1 \u2212 \u039b ( \u03b8 1 ) ) + X Y ( \u03b8 1 ) (8) E ( d 2 | \u03b8 ) = ( \u03b8 + E ( d 2 ) ) ( 1 \u2212 \u039b ( \u03b8 ) ) + X Y ( \u03b8 ) E(d) is thus obtained as follows (refer to Appendix A for the detailed derivation): (9) E ( d ) = { \u222b 0 \u221e \u03b8 1 ( 1 \u2212 \u039b ( \u03b8 1 ) ) \u03d5 ( \u03b8 1 ) d \u03b8 1 + 1 \u2212 \u039b \u00af 1 \u039b \u00af \u222b 0 \u221e \u03b8 ( 1 \u2212 \u039b ( \u03b8 ) ) \u03d5 ( \u03b8 ) d \u03b8 } + { X \u222b 0 \u221e Y ( \u03b8 1 ) \u03d5 ( \u03b8 1 ) d \u03b8 1 + 1 \u2212 \u039b \u00af 1 \u039b \u00af X \u222b 0 \u221e Y ( \u03b8 ) \u03d5 ( \u03b8 ) d \u03b8 } The first part of E(d) can be treated as the expected pedestrian gap delay E(dg ) and the second part can be treated as the expected pedestrian yield delay E(dy ). It is noteworthy that in the case of ignoring driver yielding (y =0) and assuming Poisson vehicle arrivals, the expected delay equation is derived from Eq. (9) as follows, which is consistent with the delay equation developed by Adams (1936): (10) E ( d ) = 1 \u03b3 \u2212 ( \u03c4 + 1 \u03b3 ) e \u2212 \u03c4 \u03b3 e \u2212 \u03c4 \u03b3 = e \u03c4 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2212 ( \u03c4 + 1 \u03b3 ) This generalized model mathematically estimates the pedestrian delay time, without restricting to a particular vehicle headway distribution or driver yield behavior assumptions. It can be applied to various special cases by fitting in distributions or other parameters, such as setting vehicle yield probability= 1 in the case of vehicles are regulated to yield to pedestrians regardless of vehicle-pedestrian gap (\u03b8); setting pedestrian yield acceptance probability= 0 in the case of blind pedestrians who are often unable to detect the presence of the stopped (yielding) vehicle and subsequently fail to take the crossing opportunity provided (Schroeder, 2011). 4.2 Proposed Model: application to urban settings Two major assumptions are used and applied within the generalized model presented above to replicate urban settings: \u2022 Vehicle yield behavior is considered \u2013 the driver yield rate depends on the corresponding time distance between waiting pedestrians at the curb and the approaching vehicle; \u2022 Platooned traffic is considered \u2013 the vehicle arrival distribution is assumed to be Cowan M3 model. In this case, the probability density function of Cowan M3-distributed vehicle headways is (Cowan, 1975): (11) \u03d5 ( \u03b8 i ) = { 0 \u03b8 i \u2264 \u03c1 ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) \u03b4 ( \u03b8 i \u2212 \u03c1 ) + \u03b1 \u03b3 e \u2212 \u03b3 ( \u03b8 i \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b8 i > \u03c1 where \u03b4(\u03b8i \u2212\u03c1) is the dirac delta function, \u03b3 = \u03bb \u03b1 1 \u2212 \u03bb \u03c1 , and \u03b1 is the proportion of free vehicles. Thus, according to Eq. (5), the distribution of the vehicle-pedestrian lag \u03d5(\u03b81) is derived as (refer to Appendix B for the detailed derivation): (12) \u03d5 ( \u03b8 1 ) = { \u03b3 \u03c1 \u03b3 + \u03b1 ( \u03b8 1 \u2264 \u03c1 ) \u03b1 \u03b3 \u03c1 \u03b3 + \u03b1 e \u2212 ( \u03c4 \u2212 \u03b8 1 ) \u03b3 ( \u03b8 1 > \u03c1 ) The pedestrian crossing probability density function \u039b(\u03b8) can be derived as (refer to Appendix C for the detailed derivation): (13) \u039b ( \u03b8 ) = { 0 \u03b8 < \u03b8 s y \u03b8 s < \u03b8 < \u03c4 1 \u03b8 > \u03c4 As the driver yielding probabilities and vehicle headways are both functions of vehicle-pedestrian gap, it is necessary to distinguish the magnitude of the parameters for different cases. The next subsection presents the case when the vehicle is travelling at a low speed so that the minimum braking time distance is less than the vehicle platooned headway, while the second subsection presents the case when the vehicle is travelling at a higher speed so that the minimum braking time distance is larger than the vehicle platooned headway. 4.2.1 Vehicle safely-yielding distance is less than vehicle platooned headway (\u03c4 > \u03c1 > \u03b8 s ) When the vehicle is travelling at a rather low speed, the minimum braking time distance may be less than the vehicle platooned headway. In this case, the probability of accepting the first vehicle-pedestrian gap ( \u039b \u00af 1 ) and the probability of accepting the next vehicle-pedestrian gap ( \u039b \u00af ) can be derived by renewal theory (Eqs. (14) and (15)) (refer to Appendices D and E for the detailed derivation): (14) \u039b \u00af 1 = \u222b 0 \u221e \u039b ( \u03b8 1 ) \u03d5 ( \u03b8 1 ) d \u03b8 1 = y \u03b1 + \u03b3 \u03c1 ( \u03b3 \u03c1 \u2212 \u03b3 \u03b8 s + \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1 e \u2212 ( \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 ) + \u03b1 \u03b1 + \u03b3 \u03c1 e \u2212 ( \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 (15) \u039b \u00af = \u222b 0 \u221e \u039b ( \u03b8 ) \u03d5 ( \u03b8 ) d \u03b8 = \u03b1 y + \u03b1 ( 1 \u2212 y ) e \u2212 ( \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 The expected pedestrian delay time under this delayed renewal process (E(d)) is obtained by estimating the wait time conditional on crossing in the first vehicle-pedestrian lag (E(d|\u03b81)) and the wait time conditional on crossing during subsequent gaps (E(d 2|\u03b8)). For E(d|\u03b81), in the case of \u03b81 < \u03b8 s , the driver is not able to yield (the lag is less than the vehicle safely-yielding distance) so that the pedestrian cannot cross. The expected wait time is the sum of the first lag (\u03b81) plus the wait time under the ordinary renewal process (E(d 2)). In the case of \u03b8 s < \u03b81 < \u03c4, the pedestrian can cross only if the vehicle yields. The expected wait time is the product of reaction time (X) and driver yield probability (y) (if the driver yields) plus the product of expected wait time (\u03b81 + E(d 2)) and driver no-yield probability (1\u2212 y) (if the driver does not yield). In the case of \u03b81 > \u03c4, the pedestrian can cross immediately. The expected wait time is zero. E(d|\u03b81) is estimated as follows: (16) E ( d | \u03b8 1 ) = { \u03b8 1 + E ( d 2 ) \u03b8 1 < \u03b8 s X y + ( \u03b8 1 + E ( d 2 ) ) ( 1 \u2212 y ) \u03b8 s < \u03b8 1 < \u03c4 0 \u03b8 1 > \u03c4 Similarly, the wait time conditional on crossing in the subsequent gaps (E(d 2|\u03b8)) is estimated as follows: (17) E ( d 2 | \u03b8 ) = { \u03b8 + E ( d 2 ) \u03b8 < \u03b8 s X y + ( \u03b8 + E ( d 2 ) ) ( 1 \u2212 y ) \u03b8 s < \u03b8 < \u03c4 0 \u03b8 > \u03c4 The total expected delay (E(d)) is thus derived from the generalized model (Eq. (9)) as follows (refer to Appendix F for the detailed derivation): (18) E ( d ) = { \u03b3 2 ( \u03b1 + \u03b3 \u03c1 ) ( \u03c1 2 ( 1 \u2212 y ) + \u03b8 s 2 y ) + \u03b1 ( 1 \u2212 y ) ( 1 \u03b1 + \u03b3 \u03c1 + 1 \u2212 \u039b \u00af 1 \u039b \u00af ) ( \u03c1 + 1 \u03b3 \u2212 ( \u03c4 + 1 \u03b3 ) e \u2212 ( \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c1 ) ) } + { X y \u03b1 ( 1 \u2212 e \u2212 ( \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 ) ( 1 + 1 \u2212 \u039b \u00af 1 \u039b \u00af 1 ( \u03b1 + \u03b3 \u03c1 ) ) + X y 1 \u2212 \u039b \u00af 1 \u039b \u00af \u03b3 ( \u03b1 + \u03b3 \u03c1 ) ( \u03c1 \u2212 \u03b8 s ) } The first part of E(d) can be treated as the expected pedestrian delay for crossing during a gap E(dg ) and the second part can be treated as the expected pedestrian delay due to reaction time for crossing during a yield E(dy ). 4.2.2 Vehicle safely-yielding distance is larger than vehicle platooned headway (\u03c4 > \u03b8 s > \u03c1) When the vehicle is travelling at a high speed, the minimum braking time distance may be larger than the vehicle platooned headway. In this case, the probability of accepting the first vehicle-pedestrian gap ( \u039b \u00af 1 ) and the probability of accepting the next vehicle-pedestrian gap ( \u039b \u00af ) can be derived by renewal theory (as presented in Appendices D and E): (19) \u039b \u00af 1 = \u222b 0 \u221e \u039b ( \u03b8 1 ) \u03d5 ( \u03b8 1 ) d \u03b8 1 = \u03b1 y \u03b1 + \u03b3 \u03c1 ( e \u2212 ( \u03b8 s \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 \u2212 e \u2212 ( \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 ) + \u03b1 \u03b1 + \u03b3 \u03c1 e \u2212 ( \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 (20) \u039b \u00af = \u222b 0 \u221e \u039b ( \u03b8 ) \u03d5 ( \u03b8 ) d \u03b8 = \u03b1 y ( e \u2212 ( \u03b8 s \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 \u2212 e \u2212 ( \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 ) + \u03b1 e \u2212 ( \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 Similar to the model formulation in Section 4.2.1, the expected pedestrian delay is estimated as follows with the first part as the expected delay for crossing during a gap E(dg ) and the second part as the expected delay due to reaction time for crossing during a yield E(dy ) (refer to Appendix G): (21) E ( d ) = { \u03b3 \u03c1 2 2 ( \u03b1 + \u03b3 \u03c1 ) + \u03b1 \u03b1 + \u03b3 \u03c1 ( \u03c1 + 1 \u03b3 \u2212 ( \u03b8 s + 1 \u03b3 ) e \u2212 ( \u03b8 s \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 ) + \u03b1 ( 1 \u2212 y ) \u03b1 + \u03b3 \u03c1 ( ( \u03b8 s + 1 \u03b3 ) e \u2212 ( \u03b8 s \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 \u2212 ( \u03c4 + 1 \u03b3 ) e \u2212 ( \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 ) + \u03b1 1 \u2212 \u039b \u00af 1 \u039b \u00af ( \u03c1 + 1 \u03b3 \u2212 ( \u03b8 s + 1 \u03b3 ) e \u2212 ( \u03b8 s \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 ) + \u03b1 ( 1 \u2212 y ) 1 \u2212 \u039b \u00af 1 \u039b \u00af ( ( \u03b8 s + 1 \u03b3 ) e \u2212 ( \u03b8 s \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 \u2212 ( \u03c4 + 1 \u03b3 ) e \u2212 ( \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 ) } + { X y \u03b1 ( e \u2212 ( \u03b8 s \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 \u2212 e \u2212 ( \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c1 ) \u03b3 ) ( 1 + 1 \u2212 \u039b \u00af 1 \u039b \u00af 1 ( \u03b1 + \u03b3 \u03c1 ) ) } 4.3 Application adopting the HCM Assumptions: comparison to the HCM 2010 framework The HCM 2010 assumes the vehicle arrivals are Poisson distributed (vehicle headways follow the negative exponential distribution) and the driver yield rate is independent with a constant value. Using those assumptions, the pedestrian crossing probability density function \u039b(\u03b8) becomes: (22) \u039b ( \u03b8 ) = { y \u03b8 < \u03c4 1 \u03b8 \u2265 \u03c4 Then the expected pedestrian delay is derived from Eq. (18) (with \u03c1=0,\u03b1=1, \u03b8 s =0) as follows: (23) E ( d g ) = 1 \u039b \u00af ( 1 \u2212 y ) ( 1 \u03b3 \u2212 ( \u03c4 + 1 \u03b3 ) e \u2212 \u03c4 \u03b3 ) (24) E ( d y ) = 1 \u039b \u00af X y ( 1 \u2212 e \u2212 \u03c4 \u03b3 ) = 0 where (25) \u039b \u00af = y + e \u2212 \u03b3 \u03c4 ( 1 \u2212 y ) The expected pedestrian delay (E(d)) is estimated as: (26) E ( d ) = 1 \u03b3 ( 1 \u2212 y ) \u2212 ( \u03c4 + 1 \u03b3 ) ( 1 \u2212 y ) e \u2212 \u03c4 \u03b3 + X y ( 1 \u2212 e \u2212 \u03c4 \u03b3 ) y \u2212 y e \u2212 \u03c4 \u03b3 + e \u2212 \u03c4 \u03b3 = 1 \u03b3 ( 1 \u2212 y ) \u2212 ( \u03c4 + 1 \u03b3 ) ( 1 \u2212 y ) e \u2212 \u03c4 \u03b3 y \u2212 y e \u2212 \u03c4 \u03b3 + e \u2212 \u03c4 \u03b3 The pedestrian delay model used in the HCM, 2010 with the same assumptions is as follows: (27) E ( d ) = \u2211 i = 1 n 1 \u03b3 ( i \u2212 0.5 ) Y ( \u03b8 i ) + ( 1 \u2212 \u2211 i = 1 n Y ( \u03b8 i ) 1 \u2212 e \u03b3 \u03c4 ) 1 \u03b3 ( e \u03b3 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03b3 \u03c4 \u2212 1 ) = 1 \u2212 e \u2212 \u03b3 \u03c4 \u03b3 ( 1 y \u2212 1 2 \u2212 ( 1 \u2212 y ) n ( n + 1 y \u2212 1 2 ) ) + 1 \u03b3 ( e \u03b3 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03b3 \u03c4 \u2212 1 ) ( 1 \u2212 y ) n where n = I N T ( e \u03c4 \u03b3 \u2212 \u03c4 \u03b3 \u2212 1 1 \u2212 e \u2212 \u03c4 \u03b3 ) , average number of crossing events before an adequate gap is available. This equation is a combination of theoretical and empirical work, which limits the model applicability to different scenarios. A comparison of the two equations shows that under the same traffic condition, the HCM 2010 model always overestimates the pedestrian delay compared to Eq. (26) (Fig. 2 ). 5 Model validation using field data This section compares pedestrian delay obtained in the field to the delay estimated using the proposed model presented in Section 4.2, the delay estimated using the derivation with HCM assumptions in Section 4.3, and the delay estimated using the current HCM 2010 model. Two midblock crossings with marked crosswalks were selected for observation (one at Gale Lemerand Dr. in Gainesville, Florida, and one at Madison Dr. in Washington, D.C.). A total of 110 observations of naturalistic pedestrian crossings with 170 vehicle headways were collected in Florida and a total of 99 observations of naturalistic pedestrian crossings with 206 vehicle headways were collected in Washington D.C. The data collection procedure, the characteristics of both sites and comparison between observed delay and estimated delay by the proposed model are presented below. 5.1 Data collection Two cameras were set up near the midblock to capture the vehicle-pedestrian interactions \u2013 one was facing the crosswalk for recording the pedestrian crossing process, the other was facing the midblock upstream for recording the approaching vehicle operations. A variety of data were collected based on the video recordings, including the vehicular volume, the percentage of driver yielding, and the pedestrian arrival and departure time at the crosswalk. The average pedestrian crossing speed and the pedestrian delay were then calculated for comparison with the results from the proposed model. In our data analysis we assume the following: \u2022 The pedestrian was aware of the approaching vehicle and made a crossing decision based on the gap and vehicle yielding behavior. \u2022 The driver was aware of the pedestrian and reacted accordingly. 5.2 Site descriptions The first site is located at Gale Lemerand Dr., Gainesville, Florida (schematic shown in Fig. 3 a). It is two-lane road with a marked crosswalk (length is 60ft) and median refuge island. The vehicle flow rate (bi-directional) is 334veh/h, and the pedestrian flow rate during the analysis hour is 100ped/h. The vehicle average speed is 20mph and the vehicle yield rate is 70%. The pedestrian walking speed is 4s/ft. Pedestrian delay for crossing one lane (Northbound) was collected. The second site is located at Madison Dr., Washington, D.C. (shown in Fig. 3b). It is one-lane road with a marked crosswalk (length is 30ft 1 1 Due to the on-street parking, it was observed in the field that pedestrians stepped a few feet into the road to have a better sight distance before crossing. Therefore, when analyzing the pedestrian delay, the pedestrian crossing distance was estimated as 30 ft rather than the full crosswalk length of 35 ft. ) and on-street parking. The vehicle flow rate (bi-directional) is 611veh/h, and the pedestrian flow rate during the analysis hour is 198ped/h. The vehicle average speed is 15mph, and the vehicle yield rate is 42%. The pedestrian walking speed is 4s/ft. 5.3 Comparison results Next, the field delay is compared to the delay predicted by the proposed model. We first obtain the vehicle headway distribution of each site in order to use it in the model. Fig. 4 a and b provide the density plots for the two locations. The Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) technique was used to obtain the unbiased estimator for each parameter in the vehicle headway distribution model (Troutbeck, 1997; Luttinen, 1999). The Cowan M3 vehicle headway distribution was fitted for both sites with \u03c72 =6.290 (critical \u03c72 =16.919) and 1.587 (critical \u03c72 =22.362) respectively. The value for each estimator at the two sites is shown in Table 2 . The fitted distributions are also plotted in Fig. 4a and b. Additional parameters were obtained from the on-site observation or video. For example, the pedestrian reaction time to driver yields is estimated as the time difference between driver yielding and the waiting pedestrian starting to step into the crosswalk. The vehicle safely-yielding distance is estimated using the average vehicle speed and assuming 30ft/s as the vehicle maximum braking deceleration rate (Table 2). Table 3 provides a summary of the estimated and observed values. As shown, the observed pedestrian delays at the two sites match well with the estimated delay from the proposed model \u2013 there is no significant difference at the 95% confidence level. Numerical data support the model's validity and accuracy on the basis of plugging-in correct assumptions and well-calibrated model parameters. Pedestrian delay at both sites is also estimated using the derived HCM model (Eq. (26)) and the HCM 2010 model (Eq. (27)). Vehicle arrivals are assumed to be Poisson-distributed and vehicle yield rates are constant as 70% and 42% respectively. Comparison results are shown in Table 4 . Statistical analyses indicate there are significant differences between field data and those two model results: the derived HCM model underestimates the field data, while the HCM 2010 prediction approximately doubles the observed delay in the field. This comparison underscores the importance of applying correct model assumptions, and further validates the applicability of the proposed model in urban networks with platooned traffic and driver yielding behavior. To consider the validity of the model outside the conditions prevailing at these study sites, next we use simulation to expand the scenarios considered, and we compare the simulated results to the model estimated delay. 6 Expanded validation using simulation A simulator is developed using MATLAB\u00a9 (MATLAB, 2013) and initially compared to the field data to ensure its validity. Next, stochastic simulations that replicate different traffic conditions were conducted to further validate the pedestrian delay obtained from the proposed model. The following assumptions were made for the simulation to replicate the field conditions: \u2022 A vehicle-pedestrian interaction zone is defined. Vehicle-pedestrian interaction occurs within this zone when the vehicle approaches the pedestrian crosswalks (i.e. the time distance is equivalent to pedestrian critical gap). For example, pedestrians definitely cross if the vehicle has not reached the edge of the interaction zone. In other words, the vehicle outside the interaction zone does not need to make a yield decision for waiting pedestrians. For simplicity, the vehicles in this simulation are generated at the edge of the vehicle-pedestrian interaction zone. \u2022 The vehicle deceleration rate for yielding is assumed to be 10ft/s2, and the acceleration rate for speeding up is assumed to be 10ft/s2. \u2022 Vehicles make one yield/no-yield decision to each single vehicle-pedestrian interaction. \u2022 Vehicles can speed up to the initial speed right after the crossing pedestrians arrive at the opposite side of the crosswalk. \u2022 Pedestrian arrivals are Poisson distributed. \u2022 The pedestrian critical gap is determined by assuming the average pedestrian crossing speed as 4ft/s, and the crosswalk length is 16ft. A flow chart of vehicle-pedestrian interactions used in the simulation is provided in Fig. 5 . The rectangles in the flow chart represent basic decision making; the ellipsoids represent models implemented in the simulation; the triangles represent final status in each time step. (a) Comparisons between field data and simulation results Assuming Cowan M3-distributed vehicle inter-arrival headways, a total of 100 runs were conducted and the average pedestrian delays were obtained from the simulator. Results are shown in Table 5 . A statistical analysis was also conducted and confirms that there is no significant difference in the average pedestrian delays between field data and simulation results for both sites (95% confidence level). (b) Comparisons between simulation and proposed model results Six parameters (pedestrian volume, vehicular traffic volume, vehicle yield rate, vehicle safely-yielding distance, vehicle headway distribution, and pedestrian reaction time to vehicle yields) with the corresponding values were combined and tested with 100 runs for each scenario (one combination of these parameters is considered as a scenario). The simulation resolution was set as 0.01s. Table 6 provides an overview of all scenarios tested. A total of 1200 scenarios (100 runs for each scenario) were simulated. Fig. 6 provides the comparison results for pedestrian delay from the proposed model and from the simulation program in different combinations of parameters. The x-axis represents the delay from the model and the y-axis represents the delay from the simulation. As shown, the regressed trend line is Y =1.0303x \u22120.0589 with R 2 =0.9995. The simulation results support the validity and accuracy of the proposed model. The delay differences are within close agreement and are mainly due to stochastic deviations. 7 Conclusions and recommendations An analytical pedestrian delay model for pedestrian crossings at unsignalized intersections in urban networks was developed by using renewal theory. First, a generalized model was developed which can accommodate different traffic assumptions. Then the proposed model was developed by applying a suitable set of assumptions to estimate pedestrian delay with consideration of commonly observed driver yielding behavior and platooned traffic in urban settings. Another application was developed using the HCM assumptions, and it was concluded that the HCM 2010 model overestimates the pedestrian delay relative to the model developed using HCM assumptions. A data collection was conducted and the observed pedestrian delay in the field (Gainesville, Florida and Washington, D.C.) was compared with the results from the proposed model. It was concluded that the model replicated field observations very well (95% confidence level). Furthermore, a stochastic simulation was employed using MATLAB\u00ae in order to evaluate the model performance for scenarios not encountered during the data collection. Combinations of different parameters in the model were tested and the simulated delay was compared to the delay estimated by the analytical model. The results confirmed the model validity (95% confidence level). In general, the analytical model developed in this study replicates well pedestrian delay in an urban setting and can be used for similar applications in the future. The major contributions of this study and recommendations for future application are as follows: \u2022 The proposed model can estimate reasonably well pedestrian delay for street crossing in an urban setting with platooned traffic stream and observed driver yield behavior; \u2022 A generalized method is provided to mathematically estimate the pedestrian delay time, without restricting the model to a particular vehicle headway distribution or driver yield behavior assumptions. It can be applied to various special cases by fitting in distributions or other parameters; \u2022 The application with HCM assumptions provided in this study is recommended as an analytical model for the HCM when the traffic pattern and driver behavior satisfy the HCM assumptions. The following are recommended for future research based on the study results: \u2022 The vehicle-pedestrian interactions may be correlated. In this case the pedestrian crossing problem may be solved by using the technique of Markov Chains; \u2022 One of the major assumptions for the proposed model is that the driver yielding possibility is only dependent on the distance between the approaching vehicle and the pedestrians. But the driver yield decision may be affected by the yield behavior of the vehicle in front (Schroeder, 2008; Schroeder et al., 2014). This restriction can be relaxed and future models with modified driver yielding functions can be developed based on the generalized model provided in this study; \u2022 The other assumption employed in our model is that the pedestrian will always accept the gap if it is larger than the critical value. This restriction can be relaxed and future models with pedestrian gap acceptance distributions/models can be developed based on the generalized model provided in this study.

This study provides an improved analytical model to mathematically estimate pedestrian delay using renewal theory, which considers driver yielding and vehicle platooning. A generalized model is first provided to accommodate different traffic flow and driver behavior assumptions. Then the proposed model is developed on the basis of a mixture of free traffic and platooned traffic with consideration of driver yielding behaviors to better replicate field conditions in an urban setting. A second application using the HCM 2010 assumptions is also derived to compare it to the HCM 2010 model. Lastly, field data were collected and used for validation from two locations: Gainesville, FL and Washington, D.C. A simulation via MATLAB is performed to evaluate the model results for a variety of cases. The comparisons to the field data as well as the simulation confirm the applicability and accuracy of the proposed model. It is also found that the current HCM 2010 model overestimates the pedestrian delay compared with field data.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2017-06-30", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191261515301399", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zheng, Yinan"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Elefteriadou, Lily"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191261515301399"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261515301399"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0191-2615(15)30139-9", "prism:volume": "100", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier Ltd.", "dc:title": "A model of pedestrian delay at unsignalized intersections in urban networks", "prism:copyright": "\u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
