Abstract An important problem confronting port cities is where and how to accommodate port growth. Larger ships combined with increased container throughput require more yard space and generate more traffic, straining the urban fabric in the vicinity of the port. A promising solution to this problem is the development of urban intermodal container terminals (IMTs) that interface with both road and rail (or possibly inland waterway) networks. This raises two linked choices; where to locate the intermodal terminals and what will be their likely usage by multiple shippers, each having a choice of whether or not to use the IMT as part of an intermodal transport chain. The use of an IMT by a shipper indicates the shipper's choice of intermodal transport, which comprises a combined use of a high capacity mode (rail or barge between the port and the IMT) and trucks (between the IMT and the cargo origin or destination). The overall problem therefore comprises a mode choice problem embedded within a facility location problem. This paper employs the method of entropy maximisation to combine a logit mode choice model with a facility location model, leading to a non-linear mixed integer programming model. The principal features of the entropy maximising facility location model are illustrated by small and large numerical examples. Keywords City logistics Intermodal terminals Entropy Facility location Lagrangian relaxation 1 Introduction The growth in containerised trade in most economies has not been matched with proportionate investment in transport infrastructure between the port and the hinterland. Moreover, the increase in ship size has increased the need for more yard space for the storage, sorting and movement of containers. This has often resulted in congestion and associated safety and environmental problems in and around ports. These problems are compounded for port cities like Sydney close to city centres with limited or no space for expansion. Inefficient port operation increases the cost, travel times and unreliability of delivery times when transporting the cargo from the port to the hinterland and vice versa. Additionally, it can negatively affect a nation's foreign trade and its ability to compete in global markets, since the port is the transit point for the greater part of this trade, at least in terms of volume. An attractive solution to the above problems is the development of intermodal terminals (IMTs) that interface with both road and rail/barge networks such that containers arriving at the port can be transported by a high capacity mode, such as rail or barge (benefit from economies of scale), to the IMT and then be transferred to trucks for onward movement to the destinations. Also, export containers can first be consolidated at the IMT before being transported to the port by rail or barge for export. This intermodal system is referred to as the import/export intermodal transport system or urban intermodal transport system (UITS) as shown in Fig. 1 a (Teye et al., 2015; Meyrick, 2007). Another intermodal transport system identified in the literature (Meyrick, 2007; Arnold et al., 2001) is the regional intermodal transport system (RITS). The RITS involves the use of two IMTs as transfer nodes along the intermodal transport chain (Arnold et al., 2001). In this system, the cargo are first consolidated at an IMT close to the cargo origin using trucks and then transported by a high capacity mode to another terminal close to the cargo destinations where the cargo are finally distributed by trucks to their final destinations, as shown in Fig. 1b. This type of system is the traditional concept of intermodalism where both economies of scale and distance are key drivers for the location and use of the IMTs (Park et al., 1995; NCHPR, 2007; Lin et al., 2014). The focus of the paper is on developing the UITS and is largely motivated by continuous growth in container throughputs, increased \u2018lumpiness\u2019 of throughputs produced by larger ships, limited physical space for expansion, and lack of inland transport infrastructure connecting the ports and the cargo origins/destinations in the urban region, which often leads to congestion, safety and environmental problems in the vicinity of the port, increased cost, and unreliability of cargo delivery times. The use of one IMT along the intermodal transport chain can go some way to alleviating these problems. Fig. 2 illustrates the market share of intermodal transport mode in Australia's IMEX market over a five year period. It shows that the intermodal mode share rose from about 9% in 2010 to about 14% in 2014. The key element in the UITS is the locations of the IMTs, which determines its likely usage and in turn its financial viability. This is because an IMT usually has high setup costs and so needs to attract a minimum amount of cargo to make it viable (AHRCR, 2007). An IMT adds another mode of transport (intermodal transport) and hence increases the modal options for shippers. The shippers are expected to choose the mode (intermodal or road alone) that offers them the highest utility given their preferences and the constraints (time availability, reliability, etc.) placed on their decision making. The two main modes under consideration are the road alone transport mode leading to the use of only trucks and intermodal transport mode leading to a combined use of a high capacity mode (e.g., rail or barge) and trucks for delivering containerized cargo between the port and the cargo origin/destination locations in the urban region or hinterland. More use of intermodal transport implies more use of the IMTs, more use of rail or waterways and less use of roads. The overall problem therefore comprises a choice problem (shippers' choice of mode) where both observed factors (e.g., monetary cost, time, etc.) and unobserved factors (e.g., reliability, damage or security risk etc.) are allowed to influence mode choice and facility location. The mode choice and facility location problems have to be solved simultaneously as they influence each other. This paper employs the method of entropy maximisation to embed a mode choice model within a facility location model. The resulting model is a non-linear mixed integer programming problem that generates a linked logit mode choice sub-model and an integer linear facility location sub-model. 2 Literature review Research on Intermodal Terminal Location Problems (IMTLP) has been receiving growing attention by both policy makers and academics (Bontekoning et al., 2004). General or classical facility location problems have been studied extensively in the literature, starting with Hakimi (1964) on the location of switching centres in a communication network and police stations on a highway network. Since then, there have been several studies on the subject including but not limited to O'Kelly (1986) and Nierat (1997) for locating facilities on a two-dimensional plane. Studies on locating discrete facilities in space can be found in Campbell (1994b) and Daskin (2013); and locating facilities as nodes or links on a network or in a graph can be found in O'Kelly (1987) and Arnold et al. (2001). Hub facility location problems (HFLP) have also been studied extensively in the literature (O'Kelly, 1987; Campbell, 1994b; Alumur and Kara, 2008). A quadratic objective function was proposed by O'Kelly (1987). The reformulated problem with a linear objective function was developed by Campbell (1994b). A key feature of the IMTLP that distinguishes it from the classical HFLP is the competitive and multi user aspect of IMTLP, where the competition is between intermodal transport and road alone transport (Lin et al., 2014). More use of intermodal transport leads to more use of the located IMTs. Competition also exists between intermodal transport options, especially in environments with existing IMTs. The IMTLP can therefore be considered as an extension of the classical HFLP, where competition between modes for multiple users is allowed to influence the location decision. Work on hub location in a competitive environment include the work by Marianov et al. (1999) where the problem was formulated using a 0-1 integer programming technique and solved by tabu search heuristics. In their model, flows between each origin-destination pair can be routed through one or two hubs and each demand point can be assigned to one or more hubs depending on the traffic destinations. The proportion of each origin-destination demand expected to go through the hubs is determined by a pre-defined set. For example, the set can be defined such that the demand for all origin-destinations pairs is assigned to the new hub if the cost of using it (newly located hub) is lower than that of the existing or competitor hub(s). The set can also be defined such that only a certain percentage of demand is captured by the new hub if the cost difference is not very significant. An improved formulation was provided by Wagner (2008) with associated heuristics for solving it. They have shown that their improved model can be solved to optimality for problem sizes of up to 50 nodes in reasonable computation time. The allocation mechanisms in these two studies were extended by Eiselt and Marianov (2009), where the discrete demand allocation to hubs was replaced with proportional allocation based on relative costs between competing options. L\u00fcer-Villagra and Marianov (2013) studied the environment where an existing firm operates a hub and spoke network, and where a new entrant is assumed to maximize profit by choosing the best hub location and network topology applying optimal pricing assuming that the existing company applies mill pricing. The allocation of demand between the firms is logit-based resulting in a non-linear mixed integer programming problem, which was solved using a genetic algorithm. A game theoretic approach of locating a competitive hubs was researched by Sasaki and Fukushima (2001), Sasaki (2005) and Lin and Lee (2010). In Sasaki and Fukushima (2001), a 1-stop continuous Stackelberg hub location problem as a bi-level programming problem is formulated and solved using a sequential quadratic programming method. Numerical examples illustrate the significance of rival companies when locating and designing hubs. Their proposed model used a logit function to determine the assignment of customers to available services so as to capture their various choice preferences, compared with the all-or-nothing procedure used in Marianov et al. (1999). To prevent the situations where firms carry an unrealistically low level of flow for any OD pair, Sasaki (2005) introduced flow threshold to ensure that only flows above this threshold are assigned to competing firms. The overall problem was formulated as a bi-level programming problem where the upper level model captures the decisions by the leader firm and the lower level model outputs the decisions of the follower firm. Lin and Lee (2010) study an oligopolistic market environment. Their approach was motivated by the fact that industries such as freight or airlines can be considered as operating in oligopolistic markets, where prices are controlled by small groups of firms. Thus a firm's hub network design is largely motivated by the actions or reactions of its competitors in pursuit of profits and market share rather than cost minimization (Lin and Lee, 2010). They showed that the long-term Cournot\u2013Nash equilibrium steady state for the competition game is such that none of the firms may unilaterally change their respective hub networks, demands, or operational plans to increase profit, and also demonstrated that a dense hub network is more likely to earn a higher profit than a sparse hub network under price-elastic demand. The work by Sasaki et al. (2014) considered two firms competing for customers in a Stackelberg framework where the leader firm locates hub arcs to maximize revenue, given that the follower firm will subsequently locate its own hub arcs to maximize its own revenue. They presented an optimal solution algorithm that allocates traffic between the two firms based on the relative utility of travel through the competing hub networks and also demonstrated the importance of competition in locating and designing hub-based transportation systems. Similar work in the airline industry includes Adler (2005), where a non-linear mathematical program model is proposed for evaluating the most appropriate hub-and-spoke network for an airline in a competitive environment, which is in turn used to derive a two stage, Nash-type, best-response game. The first stage of the two-stage game determines the choice of network by the airlines, whilst in the second stage, each airline competes for market share, given the other airlines\u2019 decisions. Adler and Smilowitz (2007) investigated global alliances and mergers in the airline industry under competition where they proposed a game theoretic framework incorporating a profit-maximising objective and a cost-based network design. Numerical examples show that some mergers may be more successful than others and that optimal international gateway choices change according to the number of competitors remaining in the market. Both studies used logit models to determine the market shares of each competing firm and in both models, global equilibrium cannot be guaranteed due to the non-convexity of the objective function. The location of park and ride facilities using p-Hub approach (where the park and ride locations were treated as hubs) was studied by Aros-Vera et al. (2013). The problem was formulated as a nonlinear programming problem with embedded logit model to determine the demand of the located park and ride facilities. Their solution approach involves a novel linearizing technique for transforming the nonlinear programming problem to equivalent MILP. The studies considered so far do not directly relate to the location of container intermodal terminals and the competition is largely between firms and not between transport modes. Almost without exception research work specifically directed at locating intermodal terminals where the competition is between various modes of transport is based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) techniques. The first mathematical model using the MILP technique was proposed by Arnold et al. (2001) and Sorensen et al. (2012), who solved the problem using meta-heuristic algorithms (the greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) and the attribute based hill climber (ABHC)). The model formulated by Arnold et al. (2001) is associated with a large number of decision variables and constraints, making it difficult to efficiently solve for even small sized problem instances. This limitation motivated a new formulation of the problem by Arnold et al. (2004). Their reformulated model is similar to the multi commodity fixed-charge network design problem, where IMTs are considered as arcs instead of vertices in a graph. The reformulation resulted in a significant reduction in the number of decision variables and constraints especially in sparse networks (Arnold et al., 2004). These studies considered only the location of regional intermodal terminals which require the use of two IMTs along the intermodal transport chain. The first MILP formulation for the IMEX intermodal terminal problem with Lagrangian heuristics to solve it was presented by Teye et al. (2015). As noted in the literature, the MILP technique is the main modelling tool for solving this kind of problems (intermodal facility location problem). The MILP technique has been very successful for locating facilities, especially under uncompetitive environments, and can help a single shipper or firm decide on where best to locate a facility as part of the (his/her) company's supply network. However, the problem under consideration here involves locating open access or common user facilities (intermodal terminals) in urban areas for multiple users (shippers, freight forwarders or logistics companies), where users choose whether or not to route their cargo through the terminals. As noted in Hensher et al. (2015) and McFadden (1974) in a choice situation not all factors affecting the choice are known to the analyst or can be quantified and included in the choice model. In these situations, the logit family of models has been shown to represent choices made by decision makers well and consistently (McFadden, 1974). This paper proposes a novel entropy maximizing model to solve the multi-user urban intermodal terminal (IMT) location problem in a context where users have the option not to use an IMT. The entropy maximising approach provides a framework for linking traditional linear programming models for locating facilities and logit models for determining the demand of the located facilities. The resulting model decomposes into two connected sub-models, a facility location problem (FLP) and a mode choice problem (MCP), using Lagrangian relaxation techniques. The relaxation allows the formulation of efficient algorithm for estimating and implementing the models. Proof of the existence and uniqueness of a solution is given. Reformulation of the MCP into a two-tier mode choice model facilitates forecasting and policy testing. The principal features of the entropy maximizing facility location model are illustrated by small and large numerical examples. The paper also shows that equivalent MILP is a limiting case of the entropy maximizing problem. 3 Methodology 3.1 Introduction In formulating the model, this paper assumes that the study area (e.g., the urban region) is segmented into freight analysis zones where cargo can be seen as originating from one zone and destined to another zone, with one zone being the port. The zones are connected to both the rail or barge and highway networks so that cargo can be transported from one zone to another using at least one mode of transport. The paper presents the development of the models with a description of key variables, and then the entropy maximisation facility location problem (EMFLP). The EMFLP is compared with the equivalent MILP in terms of solution quality and policy sensitivity and show that the MILP is limiting case of the EMFLP. 3.2 Notation and assumptions The notations used in model development are defined below. Notation Meaning O set of origin zones indexed by i D set of destination zones indexed by j T set of candidate IMTs indexed by t K set of located IMTs indexed by t M = { 0 , T } set of candidate IMTs plus a dummy site for road only, indexed by t R = { 0 , K } set of locatede IMTs plus a dummy site for road only, indexed by t H set of origin-destination movements with cardinality h U set of all subsets of T with cardinality p Yt equals 1 if an IMT is open at location t and 0 otherwise ft fixed cost of locating an IMT at t ($ per day) bt maximum handling capacity of IMT t (TEUs per day) p required number of IMTs to be located/opened qij the quantity of cargo to be transported from origin zone i to destination zone j (TEUs per day) Xitj the quantity of qij transported intermodally through IMT t (TEUs per day) citj unit cost of transporting one TEU from origin i to destination j through IMT t ($ per TEU per day) Wij the quantity of qij transported by the road alone mode (trucks) (TEUs per day) \u03c9 ij road alone transport unit cost ($ per TEU per day) c* ij the minimum unit transport cost of cargo movements between each origin-destination pair ($ per TEU per day) Zitj the quantity of qij transported through IMT t \u2208 M (TEUs per day) H the entropy or amount of missing information for a given probability distribution Z the total quantity of cargo in the study area E the number of possible states of modal flows P(x) the probability distribution for random variable x \u039b objective function \u03c6(x) convex function of variable x \u2265 0 C given budget of total transport and fixed cost of IMT location ($ per day) B used budget of total transport and fixed cost of IMT location ($ per day) Bij average used budget associated with each origin-destination pair ($ per day) N = { ( i , t , j ) | i \u2208 O , t \u2208 M , j \u2208 D } with cardinality n By definition Z i0j = Wij and Z i t j = X i t j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O , t \u2208 T , j \u2208 D . Also let N with cardinality n be set of all elemental alternatives of origin-destination cargo movements through IMT t \u2208 M . Thus by definition N = { ( i , t , j ) | i \u2208 O , t \u2208 M , j \u2208 D } with cardinality n. The key outputs of the models are the flow variables Xitj , Wij and decision variables Yt . The generalized cost of using intermodal transport cost comprises of three components: (1) c i t j = c i t + c t + c t j where cit is the of rail from origin i(if the port is cargo origin) to IMT t \u2208 T or truck cost from cargo origin i(if cargo origin is not the port) to IMT t \u2208 T ; ctj is road cost if j \u2208 D is cargo destination or rail cost if j \u2208 D is the port. The rail cost component of the urban intermodal transport cost takes into account the economies of scale benefit of using rail. The parameter ct is the terminal usage cost or rental passed on to the shipper, who then decides whether or not to use the terminal. In formulating the model, both the intermodal transport costs citj and road alone cost \u03c9 ij are assumed to be known. It was also assumed (common in location analysis) that the cost of facility location f t ; t \u2208 T in each candidate IMT location is known (see for example, O'Kelly, 1992; Campbell, 1994a). 3.3 MILP formulation of the IMTLP The MILP version of the IMTLP is presented as follows: MILP : Min \u039b 1 = \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 t \u2208 T \u2211 j \u2208 D c i t j X i t j + \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D \u03c9 i j W i j + \u2211 t \u2208 T f t Y t subject to: (2) \u2211 t \u2208 T X i t j + W i j = q i j \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D (3) \u2211 t \u2208 T Y t = p (4) \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D X i t j \u2264 Y t b t \u2200 t \u2208 T (5) Y t \u2208 { 0 , 1 } ; \u2200 t \u2208 T (6) X i t j \u2265 0 , W i j \u2265 0 ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D , t \u2208 T The objective function (\u039b1) has three components, the first component captures the weighted cost of intermodal transport usage, the second captures the weighted cost of road alone transport (e.g. truck only) usage and the third component represents the daily fixed costs of located IMTs. The model searches for the best locations for IMTs with the minimum overall daily cost of cargo movements in the study area. Constraints (2) ensure that for each origin-destination pair, the sum of cargo transported intermodally and by road alone equals the total cargo associated with this origin-destination pair. Constraints (3) ensure that only the required numbers of IMTs are opened. Constraints (4) ensure that an IMT is only used when it is opened and also guarantees that no open IMT exceeds it cargo handling capacity, whilst constraints (5) ensure that terminals are either open or closed and not both. Constraints (6) are non-negativity constraints, which ensure that no decision variable takes on negative values. The solution to the MILP are corners to the simplex formed by the linear equality and inequality constraints leading to the assignment of 100% of each origin-destination demand (qij ) to the least cost mode assuming no capacity constraint. This solution is intuitive and may work well in cases where the qij is the demand for a single shipper or decision maker. The solution is less intuitive for the problem under consideration, where the IMTs to be located are open access terminals with multiple users, with the qij been the total observed cargo over all shippers transporting their cargo from origin zone i to destination zone j. Also the observed costs are the average cost by mode of moving cargo between each origin-destination pair. Thus what we should expect is not the 100% assignment of each qij to the least cost mode, but the share of each mode in the transport task of moving qij cargo between each origin-destination pair. In fact even in the single shipper case, the variability in cost, especially transport costs (due to congestion) over time and the exclusion of other unknown or unquantifiable factors (McFadden, 1974) that influence modal decisions, means that the least cost mode may not always be the best choice of mode for all shippers. We would expect a spread of choices corresponding to shipper and freight attributes. This study therefore relaxes the MILP formulation by replacing the objective function with an entropy function but retains cost discipline by restricting the total transport and fixed cost of IMT location through a budget constraint. The solution to the MILP could be specified as the budget, in which case the dual variable for the budget constraint would be infinitely large. Details of the proposed model are presented in the next section followed by a proposition showing that the solution of the MILP as a limiting case of the solution to the proposed entropy model. 3.4 The entropy maximisation facility location problem (EMFLP) The principle of entropy maximisation (EM) may be considered as an alternative to the random utility theory. Unlike random utility theory (McFadden, 1974), where the analyst make some assumptions about the error terms (missing information), EM makes no assumption about the missing information (error terms) but rather considers all possible states of the variable of interest and selects the most likely state consistent with the evidence available. Jaynes (1957) noted that, by using EM, one can construct the least biased probability distribution for a variable of interest consistent with all we know about the variable. Another key strength of EM is that it also allows the estimation of demand for alternatives that are not available during the modelling period (e.g., the demand of a proposed IMT). It permits the demand for unavailable alternatives to be estimated following a similar principle in thermodynamics where there is the transfer of \u2018energy\u2019 from one point to another. In relation to the IMTLP, demand is transferred from road alone transport modes to intermodal transport modes. For ease of exposition, consider the IMT location problem; given a set T of feasible candidate sites to locate IMTs, what are the best p places to locate the IMTs? What is \u2018best\u2019, however, depends on the application and the chosen objective. Assume that the objective is to maximise demand or usage and also justify the construction and other relevant costs of locating and operating them. The demand for the IMTs relates directly to the demand for intermodal transport mode. However, since we do not have complete information on the demand for intermodal transport, a probabilistic description of the system is more desirable. In fact, even if we have complete information on the system, many factors cannot be quantified for inclusion in the decision process (McFadden, 1974). The research question therefore moves away from \u2018finding the best p IMT locations with the assumption of complete and precise information\u2019 to \u2018finding the most likely p IMT locations based on the information available\u2019. The key question that arises is: what is the best way of combining the diverse pieces of contextual information or evidence to construct a probability distribution of IMT usage with the least possible bias? The answer to this question is based on the principle of maximum entropy (Jaynes, 1957; Shannon, 1948; Wilson, 1970; Fisk, 1985). The principle asserts that the most unbiased probability distribution possible will be the distribution constructed by considering all possible states (or values) of demand for each available transport mode and selecting the most likely state consistent with all the evidence we have (Jaynes, 1957). Jaynes (1957) noted that any other distribution would imply having more knowledge about the system than what is supplied by the evidence available, and therefore prone to bias. Mathematically, the number of possible ways that a state of the system can occur is given as: (7a) E = Z ! \u220f i \u2208 O \u220f j \u2208 D \u220f t \u2208 M ( Z i t j ! ) Following the principle of maximum entropy, the goal is to maximize E subject to all the information we have about the intermodal transport system. The values of Wij and Xitj that maximises lnE also maximises E and since it is easier to work with lnE we maximised lnE instead. Thus Eq. (7a) is re-expressed as: (7b) ln E = ln Z ! \u2212 \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 t \u2208 M \u2211 j \u2208 D ln ( Z i t j ! ) It turns out that the maximised value of lnEcorresponds to the amount of missing information (or uncertainty or entropy) in the construction of the probability distribution (Jaynes, 1957; Shannon, 1948; Boltzmann, 1872). Thus the amount of missing information (H) of the resulting probability distribution is: (8) H = ln E * where lnE* is the maximised value of lnE. Eq. (8) is supported by the following propositions. Proposition 1 If the demand for each elemental alternative r \u2208 N is Zr with corresponding probability defined by (9a) P r = Z r Z ; \u2200 r \u2208 N Then, Eq. (7) can be expressed as: ln E = \u2212 Z \u2211 r \u2208 N P r ln P r Proof 1 By definition, Eq. (7) can be simplified as: In E = ln Z ! \u2212 \u2211 r \u2208 N ln Z r ! Applying Stirling's approximation yields: (9b) ln E = Z ( ln Z \u2212 1 ) \u2212 \u2211 r \u2208 N Z r ( ln Z r \u2212 1 ) From Eq. (9a) and some algebraic manipulation of Eq. (9b) we have: (9c) ln E = \u2212 Z \u2211 r \u2208 N P r ln P r Proposition 2 In the absence of any other information about the freight system, maximising Eq. (9c) produces uniform probability distributions (10a) P r = 1 n ; \u2200 r \u2208 N with corresponding entropy: (10b) H = Z ln ( n ) where n is the cardinality of the set N . Proof 2 Now if we assume there is no information available other than obeying the law of probability: (10c) \u2211 r \u2208 N P r = 1 then from Eq. (9c) the first order condition for maximum lnE with respect to Pr and subject to (10c) must satisfy the following equation: (10d) \u2212 Z ln ( P r ) \u2212 \u03c6 = 0 ; \u2200 r \u2208 N where \u03c6 is the Lagrangian multiplier associated with constraint (10c). Solving for Pr in (10d) using constraints (10c) we have: P r = 1 n ; \u2200 r \u2208 N The corresponding entropy using Eq. (9c) is given as: H = Z ln ( n ) Proposition 3 The entropy or amount of missing information (H) of probability distributions constructed with any known amount of information about the freight system cannot be greater than the entropy in Eq. (10b) . That is H \u2264 Z ln ( n ) Proof 3 Define a convex function \u03d5(x) = xln(x); \u2200x \u2265 0. Following Jensen's inequality the following must hold: (11a) \u2212 1 n \u2211 r \u2208 N \u03d5 ( P r ) \u2264 \u2212 \u03d5 ( 1 n \u2211 r \u2208 N P r ) From proposition 1 and Eq. (9c): (11b) \u2212 1 n \u2211 r \u2208 N \u03d5 ( P r ) = \u2212 1 n \u2211 r \u2208 N P r ln ( P r ) = ( H ) 1 n Z Also proposition 2 and Eq. (10a), (11c) \u2212 \u03d5 ( 1 n \u2211 r \u2208 N P r ) = \u2212 ( 1 n \u2211 r \u2208 N P r ) ln ( 1 n \u2211 r \u2208 N P r ) = \u2212 1 n ln ( 1 n ) = 1 n ln ( n ) It therefore follows from Eq. (11a) that (11d) H \u2264 Z ln ( n ) The result in Eq. (11d) is intuitive since it implies that the more information we have, the less entropy or uncertainty about the resulting probability distribution and vice versa. In other words, Eq. (11d) says that on average, the amount of missing information (entropy) about the decision variable (IMT demand) of interest is never increased by learning something about it. Eq. (10a) simply states that applying the principle of maximum entropy to the intermodal system with no evidence to suggest why a particular alternative should be preferred more than others will result in uniform probability distributions. That is, if there is no evidence to suggest otherwise, each elemental alternative should have an equal probability of being used and hence equal share of demand; a well-known principle (Laplace's principle of insufficient reason) at the heart of probability theory. Once the probability distributions of the decision variables have been constructed, they can be used to test for various aspects or properties of IMT demands. 3.4.1 Presenting the evidence as constraints For the purpose of this exercise, the evidence can be summarized as follows: 1. Budget constraint. It is assumed that the budget C is known. Section 6 discusses ways of obtaining C. This evidence is added as constraint (12). The first component captures the weighted cost of using intermodal transport, the second captures the weighted cost of using road alone transport (e.g. truck only) and the third component represents the fixed costs of locating the required number of IMTs, with the sum not exceeding the total allocated budget (C): (12) \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 t \u2208 T \u2211 j \u2208 D c i t j X i t j + \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D \u03c9 i j W i j + \u2211 t \u2208 T f t Y t \u2264 C 2. Conservation of cargo flow constraint. Information on the origin-destination flows of cargo (qij ) are added as constraint (2). 3. Definitional constraint. The information on the required number of IMTs to locate is presented by constraint (3). 4. Capacity constraint. The handling capacity limit of the each IMT: Constraints (4) captures this information. Finally, the objective function to maximise can be simplified and expressed in terms of the road alone and intermodal flow variables. Applying Stirling's approximation to Eq. (7b) we have: ln E = ln Z ! + \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 t \u2208 T \u2211 j \u2208 D Z i t j ( 1 \u2212 ln ( Z i t j ) ) + \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D Z i 0 j ( 1 \u2212 ln ( Z i 0 j ) ) Applying the definition, Z i0j = Wij and Z i l j = X i t j ; t \u2208 T and ignoring the constant term lnZ!, the basic entropy formulation of the IMTLP called the entropy maximisation facility location problem (EMFLP) is given as: EMFLP : Max \u039b e = \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 t \u2208 T \u2211 j \u2208 D X i t j ( 1 \u2212 ln ( X i t j ) ) + \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D W i j ( 1 \u2212 ln ( W i j ) ) subject to constraints (2)\u2013(6), and (12) The goal is to maximize entropy or find the most likely intermodal and road alone flows subject to the information available to the analyst. This is a basic entropy model and can be enriched as more relevant information about the freight system under study become available. 4 Solving the EMFLP 4.1 Introduction The EMFLP is NP-hard, because it includes MILP (Sorensen et al., 2012). This suggests that it is unlikely that efficient algorithms for solving every instance of it (EMFLP) can be found (Garey and Johnson, 1979 ). However, considering the fact that there are few plausible places in an urban region to place IMTs, full enumeration of IMT locations is feasible for most practical problems. The study therefore explores the structure of the problem and notes that it is possible to separate the location aspect of the problem from the mode choice aspect, allowing for full enumeration. This is achieved by relaxing constraints (4) and (12) of the EMFLP: max { \u039b R e } Subject to constraints (2), (3), (5) and (6) where (14) \u039b R e = \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 t \u2208 T \u2211 j \u2208 D X i t j ( 1 \u2212 ln ( X i t j ) ) + \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D W i j ( 1 \u2212 ln ( W i j ) ) + \u03b2 ( C \u2212 \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 t \u2208 T \u2211 j \u2208 D c i t j X i t j \u2212 \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D \u03c9 i j W i j \u2212 \u2211 t \u2208 T f t Y t ) + \u2211 t \u2208 T \u03c8 t ( Y t b t \u2212 \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D X i t j ) and where \u03c8 t \u2265 0 ; \u2200 t \u2208 T ; \u03b2 \u2265 0 are Lagrangian multipliers for the capacity and budget constraints respectively. The objective function \u039b Re trades IMT demand for costs (both fixed and transportation costs) while enforcing IMT capacity constraints. To solve the relaxed EMFLP, we decomposed it into two sub-problems; the facility location sub-problem (FLP) and mode choice sub-problem (MCP) with the FLP given as: FLP : Min \u039b L P = \u2211 t \u2208 T ( \u03b2 f t \u2212 \u03c8 t b t ) Y t subject to constraints (3) and (5) and the MCP expressed as MCP : Max \u039b M C = \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 t \u2208 T \u2211 j \u2208 D X i t j { 1 \u2212 ln ( X i t j ) \u2212 \u03c8 t } + \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D W i j { 1 \u2212 ln ( W i j ) } \u2212 \u03b2 ( \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 t \u2208 T \u2211 j \u2208 D c i t j X i t j + \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D \u03c9 i j W i j ) subject to constraints (2) and (6), for \u03c8 t \u2265 0 ; \u2200 t \u2208 T and \u03b2 \u2265 0. 4.2 Solution the FLP The cost sensitivity parameter \u03b2 is a function of the IMT location variable Yt and vice versa. If \u03b2 and \u03c8 t ; t \u2208 T are known, then the FLP can be easily solved by identifying the p smallest elements of ( \u03b2 f t \u2212 \u03c8 t b t ) ; \u2200 t \u2208 T and setting the corresponding values of Yt equal to 1. Then the set of located IMTs K = { t : Y t = 1 , \u2200 t \u2208 T } with size p. Note that if none of the terminal capacity constraints are active, \u03c8 t = 0 ; \u2200 t \u2208 K , then the terminal locations are chosen purely on the basis of their fixed costs multiplied by the budget parameter \u03b2. Once K is known, the Lagrangian multipliers \u03b2 , \u03c8 t ; \u2200 t \u2208 K can be computed by solving the MCP. 4.3 Solution to the MCP Inspection of the MCP reveals that it constitutes a trade-off between entropy and cost, consisting of transportation cost and a terminal-specific shadow cost calculated to prevent any terminal from exceeding its capacity; the larger the value of \u03b2 the greater the emphasis on minimizing travel cost as opposed to maximizing entropy. Proposition 4 (Existence). Given that the set K is known, if the set of feasible solutions, S to the MCP is defined with constraints ( 2 ), ( 4 ), ( 6 ) and ( 12 ) as: S = { Z i t j | ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 6 ) , ( 12 ) ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D ; t \u2208 R } then at least one solution to the MCP exists in S . Proof 4 Set S is convex, closed and bounded as it is defined by linear equality (2) and inequality constraints (4), (6) and (12). The set S is also not empty in terms of the cargo flow variables Xitj and W i j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D , t \u2208 K since for any q i j > 0 ; \u2211 t \u2208 K X i t j + W i j > 0 ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D . Finally, location variables Y t ; \u2200 t \u2208 K and the flow variables Xitj ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D , t \u2208 K are linearly related through constraint (4). Hence the feasible region corresponding to Y t ; \u2200 t \u2208 K is also convex, compact (closed and bounded) and non-empty. Hence the MCP model possesses at least one solution (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2009). Proposition 5 (Uniqueness). If a solution of the MCP model exists in S then that solution must be unique. Proof 5 To prove uniqueness we first show that the objective function \u039b MC is strictly convex in S . The second-order partial derivatives of \u039b MC at Z i t j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D ; t \u2208 R : (15a) \u2202 2 \u039b M C ( \u2202 Z i t j ) 2 = \u2212 1 Z i t j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D ; t \u2208 R (15b) \u2202 2 \u039b M C ( \u2202 Z i t j ) ( \u2202 Z i s j ) = 0 ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D ; t \u2260 s \u2208 R From Eq. (15), the second-order derivative or the Hessian of \u039b MC is negative definite: (16) [ \u2207 2 \u039b M C ] i , t , j \u3008 0 ; \u2200 Z i t j \u3009 0 ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D ; t \u2208 R Hence the objective function \u039b MC of the MCP model is strictly concave for all non-zero Z i t j \u2208 S ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D ; t \u2208 R (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2009). Because the feasible region S is compact, convex and non-empty, and the objective function of the MCP model \u039b MC is strictly concave on S , the MCP model has a unique solution (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2009). The solution of MCP has been shown to exist and is unique for any given set of IMT locations K . The next step to find this solution, which can be found by constructing a Lagrangian equation comprising the objective function associated with MCP and the corresponding constraints and enforcing the Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker (KKT) condition: \u039b L M C = \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 t \u2208 K \u2211 j \u2208 D X i t j { 1 \u2212 ln ( X i t j ) \u2212 \u03c8 t } + \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D W i j { 1 \u2212 ln ( W i j ) } \u2212 \u03b2 ( \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 t \u2208 K \u2211 j \u2208 D c i t j X i t j + \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D \u03c9 i j W i j ) + \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D \u03b7 i j { q i j \u2212 \u2211 t \u2208 K X i t j \u2212 W i j } where \u03b7 ij are Lagrangian multipliers resulting from Constraints (2). The KKT conditions for optimality of \u039b LMC with respect to Xitj and Wij are: (17a) \u2212 ln ( X i t j ) \u2212 \u03c8 t \u2212 \u03b7 i j \u2212 \u03b2 c i t j = 0 ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D ; t \u2208 K (17b) \u2212 ln ( W i j ) \u2212 \u03b7 i j \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j = 0 ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D Solving for the origin-destination cargo flow variables in the first order equations in (17) we have: (18a) X i t j = e \u2212 \u03c8 t \u2212 \u03b7 i j \u2212 \u03b2 c i t j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D ; t \u2208 K (18b) W i j = e \u2212 \u03b7 i j \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D To estimate the Lagrangian multipliers in Eq. (18), we introduce the parameter \u0393 ij into the models as follows: (19) \u03b7 i j = \u2212 ln ( \u0393 i j q i j ) ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D Eq. (18) can then be reduced to: (20) X i t j = q i j \u0393 i j e \u2212 \u03b2 c i t j \u2212 \u03c8 t ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D ; t \u2208 K (21) W i j = q i j \u0393 i j e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D Using constraints (2) and Eqs. (20) and (21) the term \u0393 ij can be estimated as follows: (22a) 1 \u0393 i j = \u2211 t \u2208 K e \u2212 \u03b2 c i t j \u2212 \u03c8 t + e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D Also the Lagrangian multipliers for constraint (4) can be estimated as: (22b) \u03c8 t = m a x { 0 , ln ( g t b t ) } ; \u2200 t \u2208 K where g t = \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D q i j \u0393 i j e \u2212 \u03b2 c i t j ; \u2200 t \u2208 K The Lagrangian parameter \u03b2 (cost sensitivity) associated with constraint (12) can be derived for a given budget C as follows: (23a) \u03a6 ( \u03b2 ) = \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 t \u2208 K \u2211 j \u2208 D c i t j X i t j + \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D \u03c9 i j W i j + \u2211 t \u2208 K f t Y t \u2212 C \u2264 0 or from Eq. (18) (23b) \u03a6 ( \u03b2 ) = \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D q i j \u0393 i j ( \u03c9 i j e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j + \u2211 t \u2208 K c i t j e \u2212 \u03b2 c i t j \u2212 \u03c8 t ) + \u2211 t \u2208 K f t Y t \u2212 C \u2264 0 The function \u03a6(\u03b2) is continuous and differentiable with respect to \u03b2 hence the parameter \u03b2 can be estimated using Newton\u2013Raphson's or Hyman's method (Hyman, 1969). As shown in Eqs. (19)\u2013(23) the estimation of the parameters in the MCP are inter-dependent, where the evaluated value of one is required to solve the other. A general technique for solving this kind of problem, called Bregman's balancing method (Lamond and Stewart, 1981), has already been developed and been shown to converge to an acceptable level of accuracy. We adapted this method to estimate these parameters in algorithm A1 below. Algorithm A1: Solving the MCP 1. Initialisation: For a given set of located IMTs K with size p and starting cost sensitivity parameter \u03b2 = 1 c \u00af , where c \u00af can be the average transport cost of using road alone transport mode and \u03c8 t = 0 ; \u2200 t \u2208 K 2. Update the parameter \u0393 ij using Eq. (22a) 3. Update the intermodal transport flows Xitj and road alone flows using Eqs. (20) and (21) respectively 4. Update \u03b2 from Eq. (23) using Newton Raphson or Hyman's method (Hyman, 1969) 5. Update the Lagrangian multipliers \u03c8 t ; \u2200 t \u2208 K for IMT capacity constraints using Eq. (22b). 6. Repeat steps (2)\u2013(5) until convergence is achieved. The convergence criteria can be based on the convergence of the \u03b2 parameter and changes in the flow variables. It has been demonstrated that once the EMFLP is decomposed, the resulting sub-problems can be solved to optimality. 4.4 Simultaneous solution to the overall EMFLP Once the EMFLP is decomposed into the sub-problems, and each solved to optimality, existing solution techniques such as branch and bound (B&B), Lagrangian heuristics or complete enumeration can be employed to solve small to medium sized instances of the problem to optimality. Considering the fact that the urban region is the main study area for the application of the proposed model, algorithm A2 is practical for solving the overall problem as the number of feasible IMT locations is likely to be small. Note that the size of U , the set of all subsets of T with cardinality p is polynomially bounded by: (24) | U | = ( \u03c4 p ) = \u03c4 ! p ! ( \u03c4 \u2212 p ) ! = O ( \u03c4 p ) where \u03c4 is the cardinality of the set T . For example, if the analyst is interested in locating two IMTs, then the number of possible evaluations of the MCP is bounded by \u03c4(\u03c4 \u2212 1). Also Bregman's balancing method for solving MCP converges in polynomial time (Lamond and Stewart, 1981) to an acceptable level of accuracy, making the use of algorithm A2 efficient. Once the EMFLP is decomposed, the application of the algorithm A2 is straight forward. This is because, once the set K (set of p IMTs) is known, constraints (3) and (5) are automatically satisfied; the rest of the constraints will be satisfied by solving the MCP for the given K . The algorithm A2 is presented as follows: Algorithm A2: Solution by complete enumeration 1. Initialization: K = { 0 } , \u039b R e * = \u2212 \u221e , K * the set with the optimum IMT sites with associated objective value \u039b Re * 2. For each subset K in U with associated total fixed cost of p IMTs, where the location variable Y t = 1 ; \u2200 t \u2208 K ; Y t = 0 \u2200 t \u2209 K do: 2.1. Solve the MCP using A1 for the flow variables and the Lagrangian parameters 2.2. Compute \u039b Re using the overall objective function in Eq. (14) 2.3. If \u039b Re > \u039b Re *, then \u039b Re * = \u039b Re and K * = K 3. Repeat step (2) for all subsets of U and stop 4. Set Y t = 1 , \u2200 t \u2208 K * and Y t = 0 , \u2200 t \u2209 K * As shown in steps 2.1, algorithm A1 (Bregmans\u2019 algorithm for solving the MCP) is embedded in algorithm A2 . Algorithms (A1) is iterative and converges to an optimal solution for a given set K of IMTs to locate (Lamond and Stewart, 1981). Additionally, the objective function of MCP sub-problem is convex and has been shown in Propositions 4 and 5 that the solution to the MCP exists and is unique. Also, algorithm (A2) is a complete enumeration algorithm and so guarantees an optimal solution since it explores all the solution space in the search for the best IMT location (s). In future work, where the numbers of potential IMT locations are large, we intend to find more efficient alternative to the complete enumeration algorithm. Preposition 6 Solution of MCP and MILP solution For any given set of located IMTs K , the solution of EMFLP reduces to equivalent mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solution as \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e. Proof 6 By inserting constants \u0393 ij in Eq. (22a) into Eqs. (20) and (21), the intermodal and road alone flows can respectively be estimated as follows: (25a) X i t j * = q i j e \u2212 \u03b2 ( c i t j + \u03c8 t \u03b2 ) \u2211 t \u2208 K e \u2212 \u03b2 ( c i t j + \u03c8 t \u03b2 ) + e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D , t \u2208 K (25b) W i j * = q i j e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j \u2211 t \u2208 K e \u2212 \u03b2 ( c i t j + \u03c8 t \u03b2 ) + e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D where x* is the optimised value of the variable x. The term \u03c8 t \u03b2 is the shadow price or additional cost imposed on the use of IMT t \u2208 K to prevent it from handling more cargo than its handling capacity allows. The shadow cost \u03c8 t \u03b2 is an out of pocket cost because it is assumed to form part of the terminal usage cost or rental passed on to the shipper, who then decides whether or not to use the terminal. It can be considered \u201ccongestion\u2019\u2019 price and is expected to dissuade enough users from using IMTs with insufficient handling capacities (\u03c8 t > 0). Thus for IMTs with enough handling capacities, \u03c8 t = 0 ; \u2200 t \u2208 K . From Eq. (1), the total cost of using IMT t \u2208 K can then be expressed as: (25c) c \u02dc i t j = c i t + c t \u02dc + c t j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D , t \u2208 K where the terminal usage fee is now c t \u02dc = c t + \u03c8 t \u03b2 . The terminal operator is therefore assumed to adjust the fee to ensure that the demand does not exceed the handling capacity of the IMT, making the terminal usage fee sensitive to excess demand. Thus Eq. (25) reduces to: (26a) X i t j * = q i j e \u2212 \u03b2 c \u02dc i t j \u2211 t \u2208 K e \u2212 \u03b2 c \u02dc i t j + e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D , t \u2208 K (26b) W i j * = q i j e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j \u2211 t \u2208 K e \u2212 \u03b2 c \u02dc i t j + e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D From Eq. (12), the total budget used B, can be expressed as: B = \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D ( \u2211 t \u2208 K c \u02dc i t j X i t j * + \u03c9 i j W i j * + 1 h \u2211 t \u2208 K f t ) = \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D B i j where (27a) B i j = \u2211 t \u2208 K c \u02dc i t j X i t j * + \u03c9 i j W i j * + 1 h \u2211 t \u2208 K f t and h is the cardinality of the set H = { ( i , j ) ; i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D } of origin-destination cargo movements. Eq. (27a) can be expressed as: (27b) 1 q i j ( B i j \u2212 1 h ( \u2211 t \u2208 K f t ) ) = 1 \u2211 t \u2208 K e \u2212 \u03b2 c \u02dc i t j + e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j ( \u03c9 i j e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j + \u2211 t \u2208 K c \u02dc i t j e \u2212 \u03b2 c \u02dc i t j ) Suppose that the transport costs c \u02dc i t j and \u03c9 ij are kept fixed, leaving the origin-destination average budget Bij and \u03b2 so that if the budget changes \u03b2 must also change and vice versa. It is clear from Eq. (27b) that as \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e the term with the smallest cost (c* ij ) become the biggest term in both the numerator and denominator on the right hand-side of Eq. (27b). Thus as \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, Eq. (27b) reduces to: 1 q i j ( B i j \u2212 1 h ( \u2211 t \u2208 K f t ) ) \u2192 c * i j e \u2212 \u03b2 c * i j e \u2212 \u03b2 c * i j = c * i j or B i j \u2192 q i j c * i j + 1 h ( \u2211 t \u2208 K f t ) Hence the total used budget B over all origin-destination pairs as \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e becomes: (27c) B = \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D B i j \u2192 \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D q i j c * i j + \u2211 t \u2208 K f t which is the optimal solution to equivalent MILP, which assigns all flows to the least cost mode. Thus as \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, the solution to the entropy model reduces to the solution of the MILP. Proposition 7 The budget attains its largest possible value as \u03b2 \u2192 0. Proof 7 Suppose also that \u03b2 \u2192 0, then all the exponential terms tend to toward unity and Eq. (27b) reduces to: 1 q i j ( B i j \u2212 1 h ( \u2211 t \u2208 K f t ) ) \u2192 \u2211 t \u2208 K c \u02dc i t j 1 ( \u2211 t \u2208 K 1 ) + 1 + \u03c9 i j 1 ( \u2211 t \u2208 K 1 ) + 1 Or (28) B \u2192 1 p + 1 \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D q i j ( \u2211 t \u2208 K c \u02dc i t j + \u03c9 i j ) + \u2211 t \u2208 K f t The numerator becomes the sum of the cost values of all modes and the denominator is just the total number of modal alternatives. It means that if there is no limit on modal costs, then the budget will tend to infinity. The above analysis gives us some idea of what influence \u03b2 has on the budget. If \u03b2 is large, the total budget must be small; if \u03b2 is small the total budget must be large. In the limit as \u03b2 approach infinity the budget takes on a minimum value and as \u03b2 approach zero, the budget takes on the maximum value. This suggests that \u03b2 is inversely related to the total budget. 5 Model application Once the optimal set of IMTs are located with estimated Lagrangian parameters, the MCP can be converted into a two-level nesting or tree structure (see Fig. 3 b) where the probability distribution of determining the demand of each mode (road alone versus intermodal transport) forms the upper model and the probability distributions for determining usage of located IMTs forms the lower model. This leads to the derivation of important policy measures such as access to intermodal transport modes (see Eq. (31)) and access to multiple modes of transport (see Eq. (35)) for each origin-destination cargo movement. From Eqs. (20), (21) and using (22a) it follows that (29a) X i t j = q i j e \u2212 \u03b2 c i t j \u2212 \u03c8 t \u2211 t \u2208 K e \u2212 \u03b2 c i t j \u2212 \u03c8 t + e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j = q i j P i t j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D ; t \u2208 K (29b) W i j = q i j e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j \u2211 t \u2208 K e \u2212 \u03b2 c i t j \u2212 \u03c8 t + e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j = q i j P i 0 j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D where Pitj is the probability for determining the demand of IMT t \u2208 K when transporting cargo between origin zone i \u2208 O and destination zone j \u2208 D : (30a) P i t j = P i j ( K ) P i j ( t | K ) ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D ; t \u2208 K where P i j ( K ) is the probability for determining intermodal transport usage between each origin-destination pair: (30b) P i j ( K ) = e \u2113 i j ( K ) e \u2113 i j ( K ) + e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D \u2113 i j ( K ) is the logsum or, with reference to random utility theory, the maximum expected utility over all located IMTs and a measure of access by intermodal transport modes for each origin-destination pair: (31) \u2113 i j ( K ) = ln \u2211 t \u2208 K e U i t j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D and P i j ( t | K ) is the probability for estimating the demand for IMT t \u2208 K conditional on the demand for intermodal transport: (32) P i j ( t | K ) = e U i t j \u2211 t \u2208 K e U i t j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D ; t \u2208 K where Uitj is the utility of using IMT t \u2208 K for the given origin-destination pair (i, j): (33) U i t j = \u2212 \u03b2 ( c i t j + \u03c8 t \u03b2 ) ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D ; t \u2208 K Similarly, P i0j is the probability for determining demand for road alone transport between origin zone i \u2208 O and destination zone j \u2208 D . From (26) and (27c) (34) P i 0 j = e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j e \u2113 i j ( K ) + e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D The maximum expected utility or logsum (Williams, 1977) over all modes (road alone and intermodal transport) is given as: (35) I i j = ln ( e \u2113 i j ( K ) + e \u2212 \u03b2 \u03c9 i j ) ; \u2200 i \u2208 O ; j \u2208 D The term I ij represent a measure of access to multiple modes of transport for the movement of cargo to destination zone j \u2208 D from origin zone i \u2208 O . The MCP is applied as follows; once the intermodal transport and road alone transport costs are updated or constructed, the utility of using each located IMT are first computed using Eq. (33), followed by the logsum (maximum expected utility) over all IMTs using (31), which are combined with the utility of road alone transport to construct the logsums over all modes using Eq. (35). Once the logsums over all modes are computed, the probabilities for intermodal transport mode and road alone transport are computed using Eqs. (30) and (34) respectively. These probabilities are then used to compute the demand for each IMT and road alone transport using Eq. (29). It has been demonstrated that once EMFLP is solved to optimality and the optimal location of the IMTs are known, the solution to the MCP can be expressed as a two-level nesting or tree structure model, where the upper model determines the demand of each mode and is influenced by a lower model (through the logsum), which determines the demand for each located IMT. These conversions allow the entropy model to inherit important policy-oriented properties of the logit model (McFadden, 1974; Train, 2003; Hensher, 2015), including the maximum expected utility or logsums, which represent access to intermodal transport modes or access to multiple modes of transport when moving cargo from between each cargo origin-destination pair; an S-shaped response curve which tracks the expected relationship between the attractiveness of intermodal transport mode and its usage. The curve (see Fig. 3a), which is produced by plotting the probability of say intermodal transport mode against its utility asymptotes to zero (no chance of being used if it is very unattractive) to being the dominant mode if it is very attractive. Others are direct and cross elasticity properties, which reveal how the probability of say road alone transport changes in response to a given change in the attribute level of the intermodal transport mode. 6 Numerical example 6.1 Introduction The key features of the EMFLP were illustrated using two numeric examples; small example and large example. The purpose of the small example is to investigate how each port-destination movement contributes to the location decision and how changes in policy variables such as transport cost influence the demand for located IMTs. The large example was set up to generally support the small example in terms of location decisions and policy testing and in addition gauge the computational complexity of the model. The numerical example shows that the proposed algorithms for solving EMFLP can solve real-world problems in a reasonable amount of computational time. In both examples, an important behavioural assumption made in computing the transport cost component of the budget C, is that shippers will collectively behave in such a way that the average transport costs after the addition of IMT(s) are no higher than before. It seems reasonable to assume that shippers individually would not choose to increase their transport costs because a new IMT becomes available, so they would not do so collectively. In these two examples, the average transport cost was computed using the transport costs associated with the road alone transport mode: (36) g \u02dc = \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D \u03c9 i j q i j \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D q i j Thus the budget C can be re-expressed with F as the total fixed cost component of the budget: (37) C = g \u02dc Z + F If the budget is known to the analyst, then there is no need to compute it using (36) and (37). Other analyst can derive the budget differently; some may use a fraction of the existing average cost in computing the budget: (38) g \u02dc = \u03b1 \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D \u03c9 i j q i j \u2211 i \u2208 O \u2211 j \u2208 D q i j ; \u03b1 > 0 For example, \u03b1 = 0.9 implies the analyst or planner believes the overall travel cost will fall by 10% through the location of IMTs. Thus the analyst has the flexibility of experimenting with different budgets and observing the impacts on IMT location and usage. Thus, the budget can be known or assumed by the analyst during the modelling process. 6.2 Small example 6.2.1 Data sources The data for the small example was constructed and comprises the port (as container origin) and 10 container destination areas. Data on fixed costs and handling capacities were assumed to be the same across IMTs and were obtained from recent studies on IMT location in Sydney (AHRCR, 2007; Meyrick, 2007). The cargo flow and associated transport costs from the port to each of the 10 destination zones was randomly generated and are shown in columns 2\u20138 of Table 1 . The derivation of the budget is straightforward since it is reasonable to choose the product of the number of IMTs to locate and the common fixed cost as the total fixed cost. It is obvious from Eq. (23) that in this example, fixed cost will have no impact on the choice of the best set IMTs to locate. 6.2.2 Analysis of location decisions The EMFLP and the equivalent MILP were implemented on the above dataset with the results presented Tables 2 and 3 . The purpose of this exercise is not to pitch the MILP against the proposed entropy framework but to reveal and discuss the kind of solution to expect from both modelling paradigms as the MILP is arguably the most common technique for locating freight facilities. The solution for the MILP yields IMT 3 as the best site for locating an IMT with a 41% share of the total cargo flows from the port. The distribution of flows between the intermodal transport mode (resulting from the use of IMT 3) and the road alone mode illustrate the problem associated with corner solution of the MILP, where all the cargo destined for 1 and 2 went through IMT 3 or were transported by intermodal transport and the rest by road alone transport. The problem with corner solutions of MILP models is even clearer if one considers the flows to destination 3, where 100% of the cargo flows were assigned to the road alone mode even when the difference in cost between the modes is just $36 per TEU. The point worth noting is that even if the two modes have the same cost, the corner point solution will result in all the flows being assigned to one of the modes. The EMFLP accounts for unknown factors in the choice of mode by the shippers by distributing the cargo flows between competing modes in a probabilistic fashion. As shown in Tables 2 and 3, the best IMT site is site 3 with estimated cost sensitivity parameter \u03b2 of 0.0034 and \u03c83 = 0, as the total demand is less than its handling capacity. The flows destined to each destination were probabilistically distributed between the competing modes resulting in the intermodal transport capturing about 47% share of total cargo flows, which is 6% higher than the share captured by IMT 3 under the MILP model. IMT 3 under the EMFLP is expected to have its lowest market share (about 23%) in cargo destined to cargo destination 7 and highest market share (about 61%) in cargo destined to destinations 1 and 2. The market shares in other cargo destinations are shown in Table 3. 6.2.3 Policy testing Another key attractiveness of the proposed entropy framework to the IMTLP is its flexibility and intuitive outcomes in forecasting and testing various policy instruments in promoting the use of the located IMTs. Assume the analyst or government wants to test policies that can promote more use of an IMT or rail. A plausible policy may be road pricing or subsidy for intermodal transport users or both. Subsidy would result in overall reduction in intermodal transport costs, whilst road pricing would result in a relative increase in road alone costs. For simplicity, four scenarios were generated by keeping the intermodal transport costs unchanged and increasing the costs of road alone by +5%, +10%, +15%, 20% and +25% in turn. The paper first looks at the impacts of these scenarios on mode share to the individual destination zones followed by the mode share overall. It can be observed from the MILP results in Table 4 that even with 20% increase in road alone costs across all destination zones, no cargo was transported intermodally to destinations 4\u201310. It is worth noting that the results for destination zones 3; the intermodal transport recorded 0% mode share under the base and 5% scenarios, but captured 100% share of modal market under the 10% scenario. It can also be observed that even with 25% increase in road alone cost, intermodal transport share to destinations 4\u201310 is still 0%. Looking at the big picture, the overall intermodal share was unchanged under the base and the 5% scenario, but significantly increased to 57% under the 10% scenario and remains unchanged under the remaining scenarios. These unintuitive results are due to the corner solutions associated with MILP models, with flows always switching completely to the least cost option. This analysis shows that traditional MILP models are not the best tool for estimating the demand for competitive multi-user intermodal facilities. The results from the EMFLP (shown in part 2 of Table 4) as expected show a marginal increase in intermodal transport share from the base to the 25% scenario. For example, the intermodal share to destination 1 increased from 61% in the base to about 92% under the 25% scenario. Similar results are obtained for the intermodal mode share to other destination zones. Looking at the overall mode share under each scenario, the intermodal mode share increased marginally from about 47% in the base to about 78% under the 25% scenario. These intuitively reasonable results allow for the presence of uncertainty when distributing the flows between the competing modes. These make the proposed approach very useful for locating competitive multi-user facilities and more so in testing various policy instruments to promote the use of multi-user IMT facilities. 6.3 Large example 6.3.1 Data sources It was hard to find data in the literature with all the key features of the problem at hand so we adapted an existing data set to get the right scale and features. We adapted the 20 node version of the AP dataset (http://people.brunel.ac.uk/\u223cmastjjb/jeb/orlib/files/phub2.txt) designed for Capacitated Single Allocation Hub Location Problems (CSAHLP) by re-labelling the node-to-node movements as a movement from the port to cargo destination zones in the urban region. So the 20 by 20 movements resulted in 380 movements (excluding intra-nodal movements) from the port, whilst the 20 nodes are the candidate IMT sites. The cost of using road alone mode to move cargo from the port to any of the 380 destinations was constructed as: \u03c9 ij = \u03b4dij and the intermodal transports costs were constructed using: citj = \u03b1dit + \u03b4dtj + \u00b5 t where \u03b1 is the transfer cost, capturing the economies of scale between hubs (assuming the port is a hub) and was reported to be 0.75, \u03b4 is the distribution cost from the hub (port/terminal) to cargo destinations and was chosen to be 1.0 and \u00b5 t is the lifting cost and other terminal related costs. The values of \u00b5 t were set to zero for this exercise. Since the fixed costs of the IMTs are different, the analyst has the flexibility of choosing different fixed cost budget and gauging the impacts of this variable on the location decisions. In this example, we chose three different values of the fixed cost budget (F); Equal fixed cost budget (EFC), Average fixed cost budget (AFC) and Maximum fixed cost (MFC) budget. The EFC scenario simply ignores the impact of fixed costs on the selection of the best set of IMTs. In AFC, the total fixed cost budget (F) was computed as the product of the number of IMTs to locate and the average fixed cost over all candidate IMTs and under the MFC scenario, F is the product of the number of IMTs to locate and the maximum fixed cost. Each of the three fixed cost scenarios was run for each of the 4 elements in the set {1, 2, 3, and 4} where each element represents the desired number of IMTs to locate. The models were implemented in the C/C++ environment, on an Inter(R) Core (TM) i5-3210 M CPU@ 2.50 GHz, and 8:00GB RAM of CPU. 6.3.2 Analysis on location decisions For each of the three fixed cost budget scenarios, p = 1, 2, 3, and 4 IMTs were located in turn and the results together with the computational running times are presented in Table 5 . For the location of one IMT, site 10 immerged under the EFC scenario but was displaced by site 17 under both the AFC and MFC scenarios, showing the impacts of fixed costs in the location process. The optimal IMT locations for the other models (locating 2, 3, 4 and 4 IMTs) can also be seen in Table 5. The estimated cost sensitivity parameters in Table 5 support the fact that the magnitude of the cost sensitivity parameter is a function of where the IMTs are located. What it also suggests is that estimating the cost sensitivity parameter without the consideration to the location of the IMT, could result in over sensitive cost parameter leading to higher than expected IMT demand. The results also indicate that the cost parameter value increases with increasing number of located IMTs. Similar to the small example in Section 6.2, the handling capacities of the optimal IMT locations have sufficient handling capacities resulting in \u03c8 = 0 for each optimal IMT as reported in Table 5. This result does not mean that the problem is uncapacitated. It is capacitated, except the fact that the volumes of cargo attracted to the IMTs are relatively small compared to their handling capacities. 7 Conclusion This paper proposes a flexible model based on the principle of entropy maximization for locating competitive multi-user freight facilities in general and urban multi-user intermodal container terminals in particular in a context where multiple users have choices which include whether or not to use the facilities. The entropy maximising approach provides a framework for linking traditional linear programming models for locating facilities and discrete choice models, which are behavioural, have strong theoretical underpinnings, and have been found to represent choices made by decision makers well and consistently in practice (McFadden, 1974). The technique provides a means for accounting for both observed and unquantifiable or unobserved factors affecting the modal decision process of shippers. The model is particularly suitable for solving congestion and safety related problems faced by port cities (like Sydney, Singapore or Hong Kong) but can easily be extended to solve other freight related facility location problems in a competitive environment. The paper demonstrates by numerical example that applying traditional MILP models to the IMTLP result in unrealistic large response, or \u2018flip-flop\u2019 behaviour, when forecasting and testing various policies due to the corner solutions associated with MILP models. While this may not be an issue when only one shipper is involved, it is clearly biased when multiple shippers with different attributes make decisions about whether to use an IMT or indeed which of a number of IMTs to select. The entropy approach has been shown to produce more realistic results both in terms of locating the facilities and the testing of various policy instruments to encourage facility use. The model proposed can also be applied to situations where barges replace the rail part of the intermodal transport mode or combined with trucks as an additional intermodal transport mode. The model presented assumes fixed origin-destination cargo flows and fixed transport costs. Future work will consider relaxing these two assumptions to allow the location decision to be influenced by variability in origin-destination demand and transport costs. Relaxing the fixed origin-destination flows assumption is motivated by the fact that urban IMTs also perform other revenue generating activities, such as the storage of empty containers and warehousing, and the relaxation will allow the re-distribution of some of these activities to the IMTs. It is possible to extend the formulation further to capture changes in network conditions as a result of the IMTs.

Larger ships combined with increased container throughput require more yard space and generate more traffic, straining the urban fabric in the vicinity of the port. A promising solution to this problem is the development of urban intermodal container terminals (IMTs) that interface with both road and rail (or possibly inland waterway) networks. This raises two linked choices; where to locate the intermodal terminals and what will be their likely usage by multiple shippers, each having a choice of whether or not to use the IMT as part of an intermodal transport chain. The use of an IMT by a shipper indicates the shipper's choice of intermodal transport, which comprises a combined use of a high capacity mode (rail or barge between the port and the IMT) and trucks (between the IMT and the cargo origin or destination). The overall problem therefore comprises a mode choice problem embedded within a facility location problem. This paper employs the method of entropy maximisation to combine a logit mode choice model with a facility location model, leading to a non-linear mixed integer programming model.
