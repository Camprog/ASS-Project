Abstract The Deficit Function (DF), with its graphical concept and modelling, was introduced 50 years ago by Linis and Maksim (1967) under the title of \u201cOn the problem of constructing routes.\u201d Since then, there have been many developments in the understanding of the theoretical, methodological and application aspects of the DF concept. This work, for the first time, makes a comprehensive and thorough retrospective examination of the major developments of DF modelling and applications in public transport (PT) planning and operations over the past 50 years, introduces some new developments, and offers future research directions. It is shown and proven that the graphical DF concept helps in creating efficient PT vehicle schedules, timetables, crew duties, networks of routes, bus rapid transit systems, and operational parking spaces. For instance, in one large bus company the total number of vehicles and crew duties were reduced by 6% to 12% and 8% to 15%, respectively. This work intends to stimulate further use of the DF concept as a bridge between the world of researchers and the world of practitioners. Keywords Deficit function Public transport Operations planning Human-machine interactive Graphical optimization method History of work done 1 Introduction The public transport (PT) planning and operations process commonly includes five basic activities, usually performed in sequence: (1) network route design, (2) timetable development, (3) vehicle scheduling, (4) crew scheduling, and (5) real-time monitoring and control (Ceder, 2007a, 2016; Ibarra-Rojas et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016). In order to make use of the system's capability to the greatest extent and maximize its productivity and efficiency, all five activities should be planned simultaneously. However, this integrated planning process, especially for medium and large scale PT agencies, is extremely cumbersome and complex. Therefore, separate treatment is required for each activity, with the outcome from one activity fed as an input into the next. As a result, this process needs to be supported by efficient and effective methods and tools to attain optimal resource allocation, e.g., vehicles and drivers, while maintaining an adequate level of service. To that end, a highly informative human-machine interactive graphical optimization technique has been demonstrated to be a very useful tool for PT planning and operations (Gertsbach and Gurevich, 1977; Ceder, 2007a, 2016). It is known as deficit function (DF), first introduced 50 years ago, by Linis and Maksim (1967) for estimating an optimal fleet size required for a fixed schedule. The DF graphical optimization technique has been widely used in various PT planning and operations activities. The main advantage of the DF is its visual nature. The DF optimization process is performed in a conversational human-machine mode. It allows experienced schedulers to select computer-generated improvements or interject their own practical considerations, and to further advise themselves on evaluating the immediate effects on the final results. PT schedulers are in control of the steps included in the evaluation process and can feel the improvements, which improves their confidence and comfort in using the DF-based human-machine interactive approach. The year 2017 marks the 50th anniversary of the first paper published on the DF. To commemorate this historical event in transportation science, in this work we have made a comprehensive review of the main contributions in the field throughout the history of the DF, and have cited some new developments. The purpose is to make a systematic, comprehensive and thorough retrospective examination of the major developments of the DF and their applications in PT planning and operations in the past 50 years and to suggest prospects for future research. This work is comprised of six sections including this introduction. The second section provides a description of the DF theory, which includes the definitions, properties, theorems and a mirror image of the DF. A systematic overview of various applications of the DF in PT planning and operations activities is provided in the third section. The fourth section describes some DF-based computer-aided PT scheduling software packages and provides example of cost saving results in terms of saving vehicles and crew duties. Promising research directions are provided in the fifth section. Finally, the sixth section concludes this work. 2 Deficit function theory \u2013 background In this section, a concise description of the definitions, properties, theorems and the mirror image of the DF theory is provided as explanatory background. They are based primarily on the works of Linis and Maksim (1967), Gertsbach and Gurevich (1977), Ceder and Stern (1981), Stern and Ceder (1981, 1983a), Ceder (1991a, 2002, 2003a, 2003b, 2007a, 2016) and Ceder and Israel (2009). 2.1 Definitions The DF is a step function measured at a particular terminal in a multi-terminal PT system. The DF increases by one at the time of each trip departure and decreases by one at the time of each trip arrival. 1 1 Note that the term \u2018trip\u2019 is used to denote vehicle trips rather than passenger trips. Linis and Maksim (1967) and Gertsbach and Gurevich (1977) have called this step function a DF as its value represents the deficit number of vehicles required at a particular terminal in question in a multi-terminal PT system. To construct a set of DFs, the only information needed is a timetable of required trips. The DF has its appeal in its graphical nature and visual simplicity. Let I={i: i=l, \u2026, n} denote a set of required trips. The trips are conducted between a set of terminals K={k: k =l, \u2026,q}, each trip is serviced by a single vehicle, and each vehicle is able to service any trip. Each trip i can be represented as a 4-tuple ( p i , t s i , q i , t e i ) , in which the ordered elements denote departure terminal, departure (start) time, arrival terminal, and arrival (end) time. It is assumed that each trip i lies within a schedule horizon [T1, T2], i.e., T 1 \u2264 t s i \u2264 t e i \u2264 T 2 . The set of all trips S = { ( p i , t s i , q i , t e i ) : p i , q i \u2208 K , i \u2208 I } constitutes the timetable. Two trips i, j may be serviced sequentially (feasibly joined) by the same vehicle if and only if (a) t e i \u2264 t s j and (b) q i =p j . If i is feasibly joined to j, then i is said to be the predecessor of j, and j the successor of i. A sequence of trips i1, i2,\u2026, iw ordered in such a way that each adjacent pair of trips satisfies (a) and (b) is called a vehicle chain or block. It follows that a chain is a set of trips that can be serviced by a single vehicle. A set of chains in which each trip i is included in I exactly once is said to constitute a vehicle schedule. Let d(k,t,S) denote the DF (the number of vehicles required) for terminal k at time t for schedule S. The value of d(k,t,S) represents the total number of departures minus the total number of trip arrivals at terminal k, up to and including time t. The maximum value of d(k,t,S) over the schedule horizon [T1, T2], designated D(k,S), depicts the deficit number of vehicles required at k. These DF notations are used for the example in Fig. 1 , in which [T1, T2]=[5:00, 8:30]. 2.2 Properties and theorems Note that S will be deleted when it is clear which underlying schedule is being considered. It is possible to partition the schedule horizon of d(k,t) into a sequence of alternating hollow and maximum intervals ( H 0 k , M 1 k , H 1 k , . . , H j k , M j + 1 k , \u2026 , M n ( k ) k , H n ( k ) k ) . Maximum intervals M j k =[s j k ,e j k ], j= 1,2,\u2026,n(k) define the intervals of time over which d(k,t) takes on its maximum value. Index j represents the jth maximum intervals from the left; n(k) represents the total number of maximal intervals in d(k,t), where s j k is the departure time for a trip leaving terminal k and e j k is the time of arrival at terminal k for this trip. The one exception occurs when the DF reaches its maximum value at M n ( k ) k and is not followed by an arrival, in which case e n ( k ) k =T2. A hollow interval H j k , j= 0,1,2,\u2026,n(k) is defined as the interval between two maximum intervals. This includes the first hollow, from T1 to the first maximum interval, H 0 k =[T1, s 1 k ]; and the last hollow, which is from the last interval to T2, H n ( k ) k =[ e n ( k ) k , T2]. Hollows may contain only one point. If this case is not on the schedule horizon boundaries (T1 or T2), the graphical representation of d(k,t) is emphasized by a clear dot. The sum of all DFs over k is defined as the overall DF, g ( t ) = \u2211 k \u2208 K d ( k , t ) . This function g(t) represents the number of trips that are simultaneously in operation, i.e., a count, from a bird's-eye view at time t, of the number of transit vehicles in actual service over the entire transit network of routes. The maximum value of g(t), G(S), is exploited for a determination of the initial lower bound on the fleet size. An example of a two-terminal operation, a fixed schedule of trips, and the corresponding set of DFs and notations are illustrated in Fig. 1. Theorem 1 (The fleet size theorem) If, for a set of terminals K and a fixed set of required trips I, all trips start and end within the schedule horizon [T1, T2] and no deadheading (DH) insertions are allowed, then the minimum number of vehicles required to service all trips in I is equal to the sum of the deficits across all terminals. (1) M i n N ( S ) = \u2211 k \u2208 K D ( k , S ) = \u2211 k \u2208 K max t \u2208 [ T 1 , T 2 ] d ( k , t , S ) Proof This result was apparently first derived by Bartlett (1957), and later, independently derived by Salzborn (1972, 1974), and Gertsbach and Gurevich (1977). A formal proof is provided by Ceder (2007a, 2016).\u25a1 Theorem 2 (The lower bound theorem) For a set of terminals K and a trip schedule S, the maximum number of trips in a given timetable in operation simultaneously over the schedule horizon provides a lower bound on the minimum fleet size, i.e., (2) G ( S ) = max t \u2208 [ T 1 , T 2 ] g ( t , S ) \u2264 M i n N ( S ) Proof The proof of this theorem can be found in Ceder (2007a, 2016).\u25a1 With the alert by Anthony Wren to the potential of the extended schedule technique used in the VAMPIRES (Vehicle And Mileage Pruning In Running Essential Services) scheduling program, Stern and Ceder (1983a) improved this lower bound G(S) to G(S') based on the construction of a temporary timetable, S\u2019, in which each trip is extended to include potential linkages reflected by DH time consideration in S (Wren, 2004). In regard to a lower bound on the fleet size with allowed shifts in trip departure time, Ceder (2005) showed that this lower bound may be reduced to less than G(S). An algorithm that consists of two phases was developed for opening the opportunity to reach the lower bound with shifting consideration while combining it with DH trips. Phase A is an LB-SHIFT procedure for reducing G(S), and Phase B is an LB-DH&SHIFT procedure for constructing new g'(t, S') with shifting consideration. Theorem 3 (The improved lower bound theorem) Given a fixed schedule S and its extended schedule S\u2019, G(S') is an improved lower bound on N(S) with respect to G(S), i.e., (i) G(S) \u2264 G(S'), and (ii) G(S') \u2264 N(S). Proof The proof of this theorem can be found in Stern and Ceder (1983a).\u25a1 This improved lower bound was even further improved by Ceder (2002) by looking into artificial extensions of certain trip arrival points without violating the generalization of requiring all possible combinations for maintaining the fleet size at its lower bound. A simplified two-step procedure, based on the three-step procedure used in constructing the temporary timetable S\u2019, was developed to generate a simplified schedule S''. In this simplified procedure, the second step of the three-step procedure used in constructing the temporary timetable was removed, because it proved to be unnecessary. Theorem 4 (The further improved lower bound theorem) Given a temporary timetable S\u2019 and its simplified schedule S'', G(S'') is a further improved lower bound on N(S) with respect to G(S'), i.e., (i) G(S') \u2264 G(S''), and (ii) G(S'') \u2264 N(S). Proof The proof of this theorem can be found in Ceder (2002).\u25a1 2.3 A mirror image of the DF The mirror image of the DF is a positive step function that basically increases by one at the time of each trip arrival and decreases by one at the time of each trip departure. Its starting value depends on the starting and maximum DF values. From this definition, it can be seen that there is a direct mutual dependency between the DF and this step function. Ceder (2007a, 2016) and Ceder and Israel (2009) called this step function a surplus function (SF) as its value represents the surplus of parking spaces required at a particular departure terminal in a multi-terminal PT system. To construct the SF model, the only information needed is a timetable of required trips and the number of available parking spaces at each departure terminal. The main advantage of the SF, as with the DF, is its visual nature. The SF, unlike the DF, cannot be negative, because each departure must be preceded by an arrival, thereby creating the need for a parking space for the period between them. The DF is defined as the total number of departures minus the total number of trip arrivals at terminal k, up to and including time t. The SF is defined as the total number of arrivals minus the total number of trip departures at terminal k, up to and including time t, in which the number of arrivals at T1 is D(k) minus the number of departures at T1. Let K be the set of all departure terminals, p(k,t,S) denote the SF for departure terminal k for all k \u2208 K at time t for schedule S, and PS k be the number of available parking spaces at k. The maximum value of p(k,t,S) over the schedule horizon [T1, T2] is designated P(k,S). The relationship between the SF and the DF is stated as the following theorem: Theorem 5 (The SF-DF relationship theorem) The SF p(k,t,S) can be obtained by shifting up the mirror image of d(k,t) by +D(k). The relationship between P(k,S) and D(k,S) is as follows: (3) P ( k , S ) = D ( k , S ) \u2212 M i n t \u2208 [ T 1 , T 2 ] d ( k , t , S ) Proof A detailed proof of this theorem can be found in Ceder and Israel (2009), and also in Ceder (2007a, 2016).\u25a1 Fig. 2 illustrates a nine trip, fixed schedule with two terminals/departure terminals. Both d(k) and p(k) for k= a, b are shown, and PS a = 2 and PS b = 1 are defined as the corresponding available parking spaces. The value of p(a,T1)= 2, T1 = 5:00 is determined by shifting the mirror image of d(a,t) three units up because of D(a)= 3. Thus, because the mirror image of the DF, -d(a,t), starts with -d(a,T1)= \u22121, its shift will result in p(a,T1)=\u22121 + 3 = 2. The same applies to p(b,T1)= 3. Note that in order to have a sufficient number of parking spaces, P(k) must be less than or equal to PS k . If it is not, attempts could be made to attain this constraint by constructing more parking spaces. 3 Applications in PT planning and operations The DF theory has been applied to various kinds of PT operations planning activities, including vehicle scheduling, timetable design, network route design, deployment planning of bus rapid transit systems, operational parking space design, and crew scheduling. In this section, the major developments and innovations in the application of the DF theory in PT planning and operations are described, more or less in chronological order, so as to provide a clear progression of the intellectual development. 3.1 Vehicle scheduling Vehicle scheduling refers to the problem of determining the optimal allocation of vehicles to carry out all the trips in a given timetable with the minimum number of vehicles. A chain of trips is assigned to each vehicle although some of them may be DH or empty trips in order to reach optimality. The application of the DF in vehicle scheduling under various scenarios, e.g., fixed schedule, variable schedule and heterogeneous fleet, can now be briefly described. 3.1.1 Vehicle scheduling with fixed schedules The DF was first proposed by Linis and Maksim (1967) and Gertsbach and Gurevich (1977, 1982) for the estimation of an optimal fleet size required for a fixed schedule, and later by Ceder and Stern (1981), Stern and Ceder (1981, 1983a, 1983b) for bus scheduling. In the seminal works of Linis and Maksim (1967) and Gertsbach and Gurevich (1977), a detailed description of the DF concepts and procedures used to derive the minimal fleet size for a given fixed schedule is provided. A chain extraction procedure is developed to obtain an optimal decomposition of the schedule into vehicle chains. In addition, the use of DF to construct an optimal schedule for periodic schedule was also investigated. In the follow-up study, Gertsbach and Gurevich (1982) introduced the Linis Graph to investigate the structure of vehicle chains in the optimal chain decomposition of a periodic schedule. The use of the DF theory, coupled with DH trip insertion, for bus transit scheduling was developed by Ceder and Stern (1981), and Stern and Ceder (1981). The purpose of using DH trip insertion is to reduce the fleet size below the level described in Eq. (1). A fleet size reduction procedure based on the construction of a unit reduction DH chain (URDHC), which, when inserted into the schedule, allows a unit reduction in the fleet size, was developed. The procedure continues inserting URDHCs until no more can be included or a lower boundary on the minimum fleet is reached. A set of NT (next terminal) selection rules are provided to select the next terminal to perform the URDHC routines. In the URDHC routines there are four rules: R= 0 for inserting the DH trip manually in a conversational mode, R= 1 for inserting the candidate DH trip which has the minimum travel time, R= 2 for inserting a candidate DH trip whose hollow starts farthest to the right, and R= 3 for inserting a candidate DH trip whose hollow ends farthest to the right. In the automatic mode (R= 1,2,3), if a DH trip cannot be inserted and the completion of a URDHC is blocked, the algorithm backs up to a DH candidate list and selects the next DH candidate on that list. The DH trip insertion algorithm terminates when the fleet size reaches its lower bound or a URDHC cannot be found. Fig. 3 illustrates an example. In its present configuration, according to the fleet size formula, four vehicles are required at terminal a, 0 at terminal b, and 1 at terminal c for a fleet size of five. The dashed arrows in the figure represent the insertion of DH1 trip from b to a and DH2 from c to b. After the introduction of these DH trips into the schedule, the updated DFs at all three terminals are shown by the dotted lines. The net effect is a reduction in fleet size by one unit at terminal a. The example of Fig. 3 includes a single URDHC with two DH trips. The maximum possible number of vehicles that can be saved through the introduction of DH trips is proved to be the difference between N(S) and the improved lower bound. Different from the chain extraction procedure developed by Gertsbach and Gurevich (1977), a simplified first in-first out (FIFO) rule was used to create the vehicle chains. The FIFO rule simply links the arrival time of a trip to the nearest departure time of another trip (at the same terminal). It continues to create a schedule until no connection can be made. The trips considered are deleted, and the process continues. The chain extraction procedure allows an arrival-departure connection for any pair within a given hollow (on each DF). The pairs considered are deleted, and the procedure continues. Fig. 4 illustrates one DF at k. This d(k,t) has four hollows, H j k , j= 0,1,2,3, with H 1 k having arrivals of Trips 1, 2, and 3 and departures of Trips 4, 5, and 6. Below Fig. 4 the FIFO connections (within this hollow) are noted, as well as other alternatives. In all cases, the minimum fleet size at k, D(k), is maintained. 3.1.2 Vehicle scheduling with variable schedules A small amount of shifting in scheduled departure times becomes almost common practice when attempting to minimize fleet size or the number of vehicles required. The seminal work of Gertsbakh and Stern (1978) on the variable job schedule problem stimulates DF research on reducing the vehicle fleet size using a variable schedule. The DF theory for vehicle scheduling was extended by Ceder and Stern (1985) to include possible shifting in departure times within bounded tolerances. Basically, the shifting criteria is based on a defined tolerance time [ t s i \u2212 \u0394 i ( \u2212 ) , t s i + \u0394 i ( + ) ] where \u0394 i(\u2212) is the maximum advance of the scheduled trip departure time (early departure) and \u0394 i(+) is the maximum delay allowed (late departure). The maximum interval is then compared with the appropriate tolerance time elements for establishing conditions where it is possible to reduce the fleet size by one via certain shifts. Ceder and Stern (1985) developed theoretical results of the effect of using shortened trip times and shifting trip departure times based on some acceptable tolerances within the DF framework. A formal shifting departure time (SDT) algorithm was developed to perform the shifting trip departure time process. The SDT algorithm incorporates three cases, namely (i) right shift limit, (ii) left shift limit, and (iii) shift both trips. An application of this DF approach with variable schedule to the Israel National Bus Carrier, EGGED, generated promising results with reduced fleet size, which is better than the traditional Gantt Chart approach (Ceder and Stern 1982, 1985). Gertsbakh and Serafini (1991) investigated the periodic transportation scheduling problem with variable departure times. They developed an integrated approach by combing the DF theory and the periodic event scheduling problem (PESP). The scheduling process is mainly performed in a two-step interactive process. In the first step, the DF is used to create a set of cycles of vehicles (vehicle chains), which serve as the input of the second PESP step. The procedure is meant to work interactively with an experienced scheduler who can add various practical considerations so as to make the generated schedule feasible. Ceder (2007b) further developed two methods by which single routes may realize a variable trip schedule in an efficient manner. The first method ascertains the minimum fleet size required for a given single route, taking into account possible shifts in departure times for given backward and forward shifting tolerances (in minutes) for each trip. The second method, based on the DF model, develops a formal algorithm to handle the complexities of shifting departure times. The algorithm is intended for both automatic and man-computer conversational modes. A secondary objective considered (for both methods) is to minimize the length of the shifting within their given tolerance levels. The algorithms of the DF theory for vehicle scheduling with variable schedules are described in detail by Ceder (2007a, 2016). All three procedures, inserting DH trips, shortening trip times, and shifting departure times, are integrated into the scheduling algorithms. Once a terminal k is selected, the algorithms search to reduce D(k,S) by shifting departure times (if allowed). Then all the d(k,t,S) are updated and the NT rule is again applied. When no more shifting is possible, the algorithm searches for a URDHC from the selected terminal while considering possible blending between DH insertion and shifts in departure times. In the fixed schedule problem, the algorithm terminates when the improved lower bound is equal to N(S). In the variable schedule problem (when shifting is allowed), the algorithm also uses this comparison, and if the improved lower bound is equal to N(S), the URDHC procedure (with incidents of shifting) ceases and the \u201cshifting only\u201d mode is applied. If the latter results in reducing N(S), the URDHC procedure is again activated. The process terminates when N(S) can no longer be further reduced. The nine trip example shown in Fig. 5 is used for illustrating possible shifting departure times, which employ the DF display. The tolerance ranges of this example are \u0394 i(\u2212) =\u0394 i(+) =5min for all trips in the schedule. Starting with shifting Trip 3 backward and Trip 4 forward by 5min, results in reducing D(a) from 3 to 2. This may be continued with shifting Trips 7 and 8 to reduce D(d) from 2 to 1. Because no further shifting in departure times is feasible for the given tolerance levels, the process becomes one of searching for URDHC using DH trip insertion. This yields three DH trips resulting in Min N=G (Snew)= 3, in which Snew is the new schedule. The three blocks are determined by FIFO: [1-5-DH2-9], [2-DH1-7-8], and [3-4-DH3-6]. In case a DH trip insertion is not allowed, the shifting process will end with Min N= 5 and the FIFO-based blocks: [1\u20135], [2\u20139], [3\u20134], [7\u20138], [9]. 3.1.3 Vehicle scheduling with a heterogeneous fleet In practice, usually more than one type of vehicle can be used, e.g., a bus operation company may employ minibuses, articulated and double-decker buses, and standard buses with varying degrees of comfort and different numbers of seats. A DF-based optimization framework for the multiple vehicle types vehicle scheduling problem (MVT-VSP) was developed by Ceder (1995a, b, 2011a). Due to the NP-hard complexity of the optimization problem, a heuristic vehicle-type scheduling problem (VTSP) algorithm that incorporates all DF components was established to solve the optimization problem in an interactive manner or in an automatic mode, along with the possibility of examining its intermediate steps. In a follow-up study, Hassold and Ceder (2014) further developed a new methodology for the MVT-VSP. The methodology is based on a minimum-cost network flow model utilizing sets of Pareto-optimal timetables for individual bus lines. The idea behind it, in assigning vehicles, is to stipulate the use of a particular vehicle type for a trip or to allow for substitution, either with a larger vehicle or a combination of smaller vehicles with the same or higher total capacity. 3.2 Timetable design In PT operations planning, it is preferable for all activities to be planned simultaneously to improve the efficient use of resources as well as increase the level of service. The integration of timetable design and vehicle scheduling by using the DF theory was first investigated by Ceder and Stern (1984). A 0\u20131 integer programming model was developed for this integrated optimization problem. For small size problems, it can be solved with some commercial optimizers. For large scale practical problems, a DF-based heuristic algorithm, which is similar to the simplex method used for solving linear programming problems, was developed to solve the problem in a human-machine interactive manner. In a follow-up study, Ceder (2001a) introduced analyses using departure time tolerance and tolerance for desired occupancies in order to improve matching between vehicle departure times and passenger demand while minimizing the vehicle fleet size. To construct timetables with the combination of both even headway and even load concepts, Ceder (2011b) developed a new DF-based method for integrating timetable development and vehicle scheduling by using multiple vehicle types. The method generates more efficient timetables from both passenger and operator perspectives. Later, Ceder et al. (2013) developed a methodology that uses three strategies for selecting the size of vehicles, so as to create efficient bus timetables. The timetables approach even headways and close to even-loading for passengers at the max-load point. The integrated even load timetabling and vehicle scheduling problem was investigated by Ceder and Philibert (2014). A load tolerance criterion for even load timetables was established to generate a set of efficient schedules from both the passenger and operator perspectives. Recently, a new procedure, coupled with the SDT routine in the DF model, was developed to exam the integrated even load timetabling and vehicle scheduling problem with given SDT tolerances. In order to avoid excess average loads at and beyond each trip's critical point, two criteria, early departure criterion and late departure criterion, were established. When implementing the SDT routine in the DF model, an even max-load check should be conducted. The criterion for accepting the shifting times are defined by: (4) max j = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , n [ L j ( t 1 , i + 1 * ) \u2212 L j ( t 1 , i \u2212 ) ] \u2264 d \u03c4 + \u0394 d \u03c4 where L j ( t 1 , i + 1 * ) is the cumulative load of the (i + 1)th candidate departure time from stop j, L j ( t 1 , i \u2212 ) is the new cumulative load of the ith candidate departure time from stop j after performing SDT, d \u03c4 is the desired occupancy at time interval \u03c4, \u0394d \u03c4 is the given positive tolerance (in passengers) of the desired occupancy d \u03c4 at time interval \u03c4. Fig. 6 presents an example with a \u0394 i\u03c4(\u2212) shift in part (a) of the figure, and a \u0394 i\u03c4(+) shift in part (b), utilizing \u0394d \u03c4 = 10 passengers for both parts. In part (a), the shifting is \u0394 i\u03c4(\u2212) = 3min. The solid lines (with arrows) show graphically how to determine the new loads on the (new) 6:28 and 6:56 departures at both stops A and B. The slope at A between 6:28 and 6:31 is 8/3 and times 3min. This results in an average load of 8 more passengers on the 6:56 departure, and 8 fewer on the 6:28 departure. At stop B, the slope is 7/6, and the change in load is 3.5 passengers. The criterion in Eq. (4) considers the load at A with 120\u201372 + 8 = 56, and at B with 134\u201384 + 3.5 = 53.5 passengers for the 6:56 departure. The maximum of the two is 56, because \u0394d \u03c4 = 10 (the average load can reach 60 passengers), the value of \u0394 i\u03c4(\u2212) = 3 min is accepted. Part (b) of Fig. 6 presents an example of \u0394 i\u03c4(+) = 3 min for the 6:31 departure. The solid lines (with arrows) show graphically how to determine the new loads on the (new) 6:34 and 6:56 departures at both A and B. The slope at A is the same as for part (a) of Fig. 6 and results in a difference of eight passengers, while the outcome of the slope at B is 3.5 passengers. The increased load at A is 50 + 8 = 58, and at B is 84 + 3.5\u201350 = 37.5 passengers for the new 6:34 departure. Consequently, and similar to the early departure case, the shift of \u0394 i\u03c4(+) = 3min is accepted. Recent works by Liu and Ceder (2016a, 2016b) focused on integrating synchronization timetabling and vehicle scheduling with the aim of increasing transfer synchronization so as to reduce both passenger transfer waiting time and the fleet size required. The DF vehicle scheduling component is incorporated in the developed methodology to estimate the minimum fleet size required. 3.3 Network route design The DF graphical optimization method was also employed to design PT networks. A quantitative framework for the construction of the operational objective functions of the public transit network design problem was established by Ceder and Israeli (1992, 1998), Israeli and Ceder (1995, 1996) and Ceder (2001b). This framework takes into account the passengers, the agency, and community interests. Four criteria can be considered when measuring the quality of a transit route: (1) minimum passenger waiting time, (2) minimum empty seat/space time, (3) minimum time difference from shortest path, and (4) minimum fleet size. This quantitative framework furnishes a clearer picture of the four criteria, with two optional versions of criterion (3) by minimizing two principal objective functions, minimum Z1 and minimum Z2, across the different sets of transit routes: (5) Z 1 = [ a 1 \u2211 i , j \u2208 N W T ( i , j ) + a 2 \u2211 r E H r + a 4 \u2211 i , j \u2208 N D P H ( i , j ) , for single set a 1 \u2211 i , j \u2208 N W T ( i , j ) + a 2 \u2211 r E H r + \u2211 i , j \u2208 N [ a 3 P H ( i , j ) \u2212 a 4 D P H ( i , j ) ] , for comparison (6) Z 2 = FS where: pH (i,j) Passenger hours between nodes i and j, i, j \u2208 N, defined as passenger riding time in a transit vehicle on an hourly basis. It measures the time spent by passengers in vehicles between the two nodes; DPH (i,j) Difference in passenger hours between pH (i,j) and total passenger hours from i to j when using only the shortest path, i, j \u2208 N; WT (i,j) Waiting time between nodes i and j, i, j \u2208 N, defined as the amount of time passengers spend at the transit stops between the two nodes; Ehr Empty seat/space-hours on route r, defined as the unused seats/spaces in a transit vehicle on an hourly basis. Empty seat/space-hours measures the unused capacity on vehicles; FS Fleet size (number of transit vehicles needed to provide all trips along a chosen set of routes); ak Monetary or other weights, k= 1,2,3,4. Eq. (5) contains the two options for the Z1 objective function, which can be interpreted as minimum waiting time and maximum utilization. For given weights of 1 or without units, this equation results in units of passenger hours. Eq. (6) is simply the required minimum fleet size. The DF-based vehicle scheduling procedure is used to estimate the minimum fleet size. Practically speaking, the design of optimal transit networks involves a vast amount of computations of sets of routes. Thus, the lower bound based Z2 calculation can ease the computation effort for each route considered. 3.3.1 Short turn trip design An extension of the methodology used for designing an efficient network of routes is to use it to improve the cost effectiveness of a single route. Ceder (1989, 1991b, 2003b) established a methodology that incorporates the DF-based fleet size estimation component for PT timetable and vehicle schedule design with short turn trips. A short turn trip is initiated beyond the route's departure terminal and/or terminated before its arrival terminal. The possibility of generating short lines opens up an opportunity to further save on vehicles while ensuring that the passenger load on each route segment does not exceed the desired occupancy (load factor). The methodology developed for short turn trip design starts with a procedure to determine the set of feasible short turn points among the candidate points. Then the DF theory is used to derive the minimum number of vehicles required to carry out all the trips in the complete, two direction timetable. The required number of departures is determined at each of the feasible short urn points, and then the Minimax H algorithm is applied. The basis of the algorithm is the elimination of some departures from the complete timetable in order to obtain the number of departures required. In this procedure, the algorithm minimizes the maximum difference between two adjacent departure times (headway). The DF-based graphical method is utilized to derive the minimum fleet size required with short turns. 3.4 Deployment planning of bus rapid transit systems The objective functions described in the network route design section were also used in the deployment planning of bus rapid transit (BRT) systems by Miller et al. (2004) and Yin et al. (2005). The planning process of a BRT system includes a deployment planning step that determines which BRT elements, e.g., exclusive lanes, articulated buses, and electronic fare payment (see Miller et al., 2004 and Yin et al., 2005 for details), will be included and their deployment sequence. Miller et al. (2004) and Yin et al. (2005) developed a deployment planning framework that determines the cost-efficient combinations of given BRT elements for system enhancement. Eqs. (5) and (6) were utilized to calculate performance measures for each combination of BRT elements. From these calculations, an optimal combination was selected and recommended for deployment. 3.5 Operational parking space design The SF, which is the mirror image configuration of the DF, has been incorporated into a scheduling based design tool for solving the PT operational parking conflicts problem by Ceder (2007a, 2016) and Ceder and Israel (2009). The maximum value of a surplus function, like the maximum value of the DF, has its corresponding physical meaning. It is formally described by the following theorem. Theorem 6 (The minimum parking spaces theorem) The minimum number of parking spaces required at k, Np(k) is equal to the maximum surplus function at k. (7) N p ( k ) = P ( k ) = max t \u2208 [ T 1 , T 2 ] p ( k , t ) \u2200 k \u2208 K Proof The proof of this theorem can be found in Ceder (2007a, 2016) and Ceder and Israel (2009).\u25a1 This theorem constitutes the basis of a scheduling based reduction of the P(k) procedure to reduce required parking spaces for situations in which P(k) is larger than the initial parking spaces. This procedure involves two heuristic rules: (i) shifting departure times (SDT) and (ii) inserting DH trips, so as to reduce P(k), if necessary, without increasing D(k) for all relevant k \u2208 K. The procedure described is designed for an interactive human-machine system. The selection of a departure terminal u can be made by the scheduler by inspecting the SFs on a graphical display. The search for a reduction of P(k) at u can be performed manually by the scheduler or by requesting procedures that are based on Theorem 6 and the two heuristic rules. If a unit reduction shifting chain of P(k) is found, all the SF information is updated for this new schedule, and a new iteration initiated. The procedure seeks to reduce P(k) by inserting DH trips incorporated with SDT. An example of the required parking space reduction procedure is illustrated in Fig. 7 . This example consists of a nine-trip schedule with three terminals, a single DH travel time of 75min, and shifting tolerances of 15min (both directions). The three DFs of the example appear with a gray background after going through the minimum fleet size reduction procedures. The optimum number of vehicles required is four. The SFs are illustrated below the DFs and the only complete mirror image configuration (multiplied by \u22121) is that of departure terminal c, where the shifting up is not performed, because D(c)= 0. The procedure to reduce P(k) first checks which departure terminals are characterized by P(k)>PS k . In fact, this is the case for all k = a,b,c. With the scheduling based reduction procedure, the example ends up with only one excess parking situation in b, between 5:45 and 6:30, but with the elimination of this undesirable circumstance in a and c. 3.6 Crew scheduling Another interesting application of the DF is to help construct crew schedules at minimum cost. The assignment of crew (drivers) to vehicle blocks is one of the most time consuming and cumbersome PT scheduling tasks. From the transit agency's perspective, the largest single cost item in the budget is the driver's wages and fringe benefits. To minimize both the number of vehicles in use that will comply with passenger demand and the crew cost, Ceder (2007a, 2011c, 2016) established a DF-based integrated vehicle and crew scheduling methodology. This methodology can provide an optimal solution for maximizing the unpaid shift periods, hence reducing the crew costs, with the assurance of maintaining the minimum number of vehicles required. For a given hollow, H m k , let I m k be the set of all arrival epochs t e i in H m k , and let J m k be the set of all departure epochs t s j in H m k . The difference in time between departure and arrival is defined as \u0394 i j = t s j \u2212 t e i for t s j > t e i in H m k . The joining (connection) between t e i and t s j in a vehicle block is effectively the idle time between trips. Hence, \u0394 ij may represent this idle time. In addition a local peak uv is defined within hollow H m k as d(k,tuv) between t s u a n d t e v , in which e m k < t s u \u2264 t u v \u2264 t e v < s m + 1 k , where H m k starts and ends at e m k and s m + 1 k , respectively. Note that if the start and/or end of a local peak, uv, has more than one departure or arrival, then it suffices to refer to only one of them (as u or v). Let d uv k , m be the number of departures in H m k before and including t s u , and a uv k , m be the number of arrivals in H m k before t s u . Lemma 1 The number of arrival-departure joinings in hollow H m k before t s u must be d uv k , m . Proof If some departure epochs before a local peak, uv, are left without a joining, it will be impossible to connect them with arrival epochs after t e v . That is, each departure epoch before and including t s u must have a joining to an earlier arrival time within H m k . This can be seen in Fig. 8 (a).\u25a1 Lemma 2 The number of arrival-departure joinings that can be constructed after t e v within H m k is ( a uv k , m \u2212 d uv k , m ) . Proof Given hollow H m k and local peak uv, then, based on Lemma 1 and the characteristics of local peaks in hollows, d uv k , m , departure epochs must and can be joined to earlier arrival epochs in H m k . Hence, the number of arrival epochs left without joinings is ( a uv k , m \u2212 d uv k , m ) for all local peaks. Fig. 8(b) displays this explanation.\u25a1 Lemma 3 The sum of all idle times within any hollow is a fixed number and independent of any procedure aimed at joining arrival and departure epochs; i.e., \u2211 i, j \u0394ij = constant. Proof Let H m k have n arrivals and n departures. It is noted previously that the number of departures and arrivals are the same within each middle hollow (i.e., excluding the first and last hollows). Let two different n-joining arrangements with idle times \u0394 i j 1 and \u0394 i j 2 for all joinings between i \u2208 I m k and j \u2208 J m k be expressed as follows: \u2211 i , j \u0394 i j 1 = \u2211 i , j ( t s 1 j \u2212 t e 1 i ) = \u2211 j t s 1 j \u2212 \u2211 i t e 1 i , and similarly \u2211 i , j \u0394 i j 2 = \u2211 j t s 2 j \u2212 \u2211 i t e 2 i . It is known that the sum of all departure or arrival times in a hollow is a fixed number. Hence \u2211 i , j \u0394 i j 1 = \u2211 i , j \u0394 i j 2 = constant . Fig. 8(c) further clarifies this argument.\u25a1 For a given hollow H m k at terminal k, let I m k be the set of all arrival epochs t e i in H m k , and let J m k be the set of all departure epochs t s j in H m k . Let xij be a 0\u20131 variable associated with a trip joining between the arrival of the ith trip to H m k and the departure from H m k of the jth. The problem of finding the maximum number of idle times greater than or equal to the maximum paid idle time (swing time) Tmax in hollow H m k is as follows: (8) M a x Z = \u2211 i \u2208 I m k \u2211 j \u2208 J m k x i j (9) Subject to : \u2211 j \u2208 J m k x i j \u2264 1 , i \u2208 I m k (10) \u2211 i \u2208 I m k x i j \u2264 1 , j \u2208 J m k (11) x i j = { 0 , 1 } , i \u2208 I m k , j \u2208 J m k The binary decision variables are determined by: (12) x i j = { 1 , t s j \u2212 t e i \u2265 T max 0 , o t h e r w i s e Because of the NP-complete property of the mathematical model, a simplified heuristic algorithm named algorithm TmF, which contains both Tmax and FIFO rule considerations, was developed by Ceder (2011c). Implementation of this methodology by both the EGGED bus carrier in Israel and the KMB bus company in Hong Kong has resulted in significant cost reductions. 4 DF-based scheduling software and cost saving results Several packages of computer-aided PT scheduling software whose development has benefited from the DF theory can now be briefly described. The main features and DF components of these software packages are described in chronological order as follows. AUTOBUS (AUTOmated BUs Scheduling) is the first DF-based graphical human-machine interactive microcomputer scheduling program developed for Egged, Israel's national bus carrier, to assist schedulers in the operational planning process, mainly for timetable construction and bus scheduling. Detailed descriptions of the working principles were provided by Stern and Ceder (1981) and Ceder and Stern (1981, 1985). AUTOBUS has the ability to handle multi-terminal bus systems, variable trip departures and travel times, deadheading trips (including those for interlining pull-in and pull-out) and timetable construction. A timetable editor is included which allows the addition, deletion and modification of trips. Three sub-routines, namely shortening travel time, shifting trip departure times and inserting deadheading trips, are utilized in the program to reduce the fleet size. AUTOBUS has the ability to provide alternative candidate sets of vehicle chains (blocks) and also can allow schedulers to balance the schedule generated. The DF theory is incorporated into another scheduling software package called OPTIBUS which is comprised of three interrelated modules: (a) a timetable design module, (b) a vehicle scheduling module, and (c) a crew scheduling module. Ceder et al. (1988) provided an overview of the OPTIBUS scheduling system, as well as experience accumulated in several transit companies in Europe. The program is implemented in six languages \u2013 English, German, Finnish, Norwegian, French and Italian. OPTIBUS is an interactive system, using its own data-driven interactive screen control system. These systems are easily installed and easy to use as they carry out only the most basic operations. In addition, OPTIBUS contains many scheduling modules that are easy to install and use because they can be quickly customized. The screen handling module is the front end of every interactive program. Thus, the users, with very little training, can design and produce their own screen formats. PT Manager is another computer-aided PT scheduling software package developed by using the DF theory. Ceder (2007a) gives a general description of this software. The working process of PT Manager mainly includes three stages: (i) pre-processing, in which the necessary data are prepared and the required setting and constraints are configured, (ii) processing, in which both custom and auto-planning functions are available, and (iii) post-processing, in which the optimized schedule can be reported in detail. SDT as well as the inserting of DH trips\u2019 DF sub-routines, which can run automatically as shown in Fig. 9 , are incorporated in the software. The GUI (graphical user interface) concept used in the PT Manager is to display a large amount of graphical objects, such as DFs, trips, and blocks, so that the user can customize the workspace layout by choosing various display options. In 2008, the DF modelling was implemented on a spreadsheet at the KMB bus company in Hong Kong for testing and immediately saved twelve buses in the morning peak. In addition, in 2008 an early version of a scheduling package, DF-based, was used during the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games and resulted in significant reduction of the number of vehicles required. Lately, a new, integrated and coordinated human-machine interactive bus transit scheduling system has been developed for the Beijing Public Transport Holdings (Group) Co., Ltd. (BPTG), one of the largest bus transit companies in the world. The system, based on the highly informative DF graphical optimization technique, allows schedulers to select computer generated improvements or interject their own practical considerations, and to further advise themselves on evaluating immediate effects on the final schedule. As described by Liu et al. (2016), the initial implementation of the new system in two sub-companies of BPTG demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency with many good features, such as improved integration and coordination of scheduling vehicles and crews, reduced vehicle fleet size and reduced number of crew duties. For different testing data sets collected from the two bus sub-companies, the computational results show that by using the DF-based software, the total number of vehicles and crew duties can be reduced by 6%\u221212% and by 8%\u221215%, respectively, compared with the current manual schedules. 5 Prospects for future research Although considerable progress, from both theoretical and application aspects, has been accomplished in the field of DF in the past 50 years, there is still room for further work. In this section, we discuss some promising research prospects with respect to methodological and application aspects. 5.1 New DF-based methodological framework In previous DF research, the main advances in the methodological aspects have focused on heuristic rules, such as inserting DH trips, shifting trip departure times, and shortening travel times, used within the methodological framework. However, there has been lack of progress with respect to the DF-based methodological framework. The traditional DF-based methodological framework is not computationally efficient, especially for large scale problems in practices. Let us refer to the traditional DF-based methodological framework as \u201cpure DF (PDF),\u201d because it does not contain mechanisms allowing the use of existing powerful optimization algorithms. The new development can be called \u201coptimization DF (ODF).\u201d The new ODF methodological framework, depicted schematically in Fig. 10 , uses a two-stage optimization strategy. The first stage makes use of some existing, powerful computer-aided optimizers which are based on exact algorithms, heuristic or meta-heuristic algorithms, to quickly generate a set of initial solutions. Some of the initial solutions may be infeasible. The second stage employs the DF graphical optimization method to perform further optimization of the initial solutions by using experienced schedulers\u2019 practical scheduling considerations and DF heuristic rules in a human-machine interactive manner. Based on the computer generated improvements in the first stage, schedulers can interject their own practical considerations. Then, they can further advise themselves with respect to evaluating immediate effects on the results obtained in the second stage. The feedback loop between the two stages refines the results, and does not stop until achieving results which account for the implications and considerations of both stages. The idea behind this new ODF methodological framework is to use the beneficial work by operations researchers to increase the computation efficiency, so that it can handle PT planning and operations problems of realistic sizes. The main advantage of the ODF methodological framework is that it combines the computation efficiency of the existing powerful optimization algorithms and the visual nature of the DF graphical optimization method. It is a hybrid and useful tool to improve the efficiency and accuracy of fleet size estimation. Since many problems in PT planning and operations include fleet size estimation, then, the new ODF methodological framework can be applied to various kinds of PT planning and operations problems. 5.2 Future research directions In an earlier work, Ceder and Stern (1981) indicated four main research directions under the traditional PDF framework. Some extensions and considerations with respect to these directions, such as flexible departure and travel times for trips, non-identical vehicle types, and garage limitation at depots, have already been addressed in previous studies. However, some of them are still not addressed or not adequately addressed in the current literature. Some promising future research directions are identified, and specified as follows: (1) Improvement of the ODF methodological framework to handle large scale PT planning and operations problems in practices. The framework can be improved by incorporating more of the existing powerful optimization algorithms, so as to increase the efficiency and automation of the computation process. (2) Inclusion of customized operational constraints. Different transit agencies use different scheduling strategies with different operational constraints, such as depot capacity limitation, balanced schedules, driver and vehicle operational constraints (meals, refueling, charging, drivers\u2019 locations, etc.). The scheduling process should be generalized, so that practical constraints can be easily incorporated and fulfilled in the DF-based modelling framework in an automatic manner. (3) Consideration of dynamic and stochastic features. It is known that PT systems are unstable. Many PT service elements, such as travel time, dwell time, passenger demand, etc., are stochastic and time dependent variables. Taking into consideration the dynamic and stochastic nature of these elements in the service planning and operations process can help to achieve more robust and reliable PT service. A framework using the rolling horizon approach, as illustrated in Fig. 11 , was proposed for DF-based dynamic PT operations planning. The rolling horizon approach has been used in various traffic and transportation problems, e.g., traffic signal control (Gartner, 1982; Chen et al., 1987), dynamic traffic assignment (Peeta and Mahmassani, 1995; Mahmassani 2001), dispatching of taxis (Bell et al., 2005), and transit transfer synchronization (Liu et al., 2015). Under this framework, the DF-based optimization is performed at each stage by making use of real time and predicted information. (4) Evaluation of the optimization results according to multi-objective criteria. The final results need to be evaluated by taking PT users, as well as agencies and community/government interests into account. These three perspectives emanate from the broad spectrum of transit activities. Pareto-efficient solution schemes can thereby be generated and subsequently support better decision-making. (5) Integration of different operational planning activities. With the increased computational capacity of computers, it is desirable that all or some of the operational activities can be integrated and planned simultaneously within the DF-based modelling framework so as to obtain global optimal solutions. 6 Conclusions The application of efficient and effective methods and tools in PT planning and operations can significantly improve operation efficiency and the level of service of existing PT systems. This will involve increased connectivity, synchronization, and attractiveness, striving towards far more user oriented, system optimal, smart and sustainable PT systems. This will ultimately help to shift a significant amount of private car users to PT use in a sustainable manner. The DF, given to us by Linis and Maksim (1967), allows for methods and tools to be employed to improve PT patronage and livability from the perspective of PT users, and reduce operation costs, from the perspective of PT operators. In effect, 50 years after its invention, the DF is finding its applications in almost all activities of PT planning and operations. Many important developments have been made on the theoretical, methodological, and application aspects of the DF theory. This work, for the first time, provides a systematic, comprehensive, and thorough retrospective examination of the major developments of the DF and their applications in PT planning and operations in the past 50 years. In addition, some DF-related future research directions are also proposed. In conclusion, this work aims to encourage and stimulate further interest for research in the use of the DF concept and to pave the way to using DF modelling as a bridge between the world of researchers and the world of practitioners.

This work, for the first time, makes a comprehensive and thorough retrospective examination of the major developments of DF modelling and applications in public transport (PT) planning and operations over the past 50 years, introduces some new developments, and offers future research directions. It is shown and proven that the graphical DF concept helps in creating efficient PT vehicle schedules, timetables, crew duties, networks of routes, bus rapid transit systems, and operational parking spaces. For instance, in one large bus company the total number of vehicles and crew duties were reduced by 6% to 12% and 8% to 15%, respectively. This work intends to stimulate further use of the DF concept as a bridge between the world of researchers and the world of practitioners.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2017-06-30", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191261516306956", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Liu, Tao"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "(Avi) Ceder, Avishai"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191261516306956"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261516306956"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0191-2615(16)30695-6", "prism:volume": "100", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier Ltd.", "dc:title": "Deficit function related to public transport: 50 year retrospective, new developments, and prospects", "prism:copyright": "\u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
