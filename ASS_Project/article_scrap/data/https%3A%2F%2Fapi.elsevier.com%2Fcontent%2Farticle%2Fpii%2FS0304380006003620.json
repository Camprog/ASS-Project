Abstract An object-oriented model of environment\u2013mussel aquaculture interactions and mussel carrying-capacity within Lagune de la Grande-Entr\u00e9e (GEL), Iles-de-la-Madeleine, Qu\u00e9bec, was constructed to assist in development of sustainable mussel culture in this region. A multiple box ecosystem model for GEL tied to the output of a hydrodynamic model was constructed using Simile software, which has inherent ability to represent spatial elements and specify water exchange between modelled regions. Mussel growth and other field data were used for model validation. Plackett\u2013Burman sensitivity analysis demonstrated that a variety of bioenergetic parameters of zooplankton and phytoplankton submodels were important in model outcomes. Model results demonstrated that mussel aquaculture can be further developed throughout the lagoon. At present culture densities, phytoplankton depletion is minimal, and there is little food limitation of mussel growth. Results indicated that increased stocking density of mussels in the existing farm will lead to decreased mass per individual mussel. Depending on the location of new farm emplacement within the lagoon, implementation of new aquaculture sites either reduced mussel growth in the existing farm due to depletion of phytoplankton, or exhibited minimum negative impact on the existing farm. With development throughout GEL, an excess of phytoplankton was observed during the year in all modelled regions, even at stocking densities as high as 20musselsm\u22123. Although mussels cultured at this density do not substantially impact the ecosystem, their growth is controlled by the flux of phytoplankton food and abundance of zooplankton competitors. This model provides an effective tool to examine expansion of shellfish farming to new areas, balancing culture location and density. Keywords Mussels Aquaculture Ecosystem model Carrying-capacity Magdalen Islands 1 Introduction Suspended culture of the native blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) is a growth industry in Canada, and there is widespread interest in predicting product yield as well as potential environmental impacts. Although there are still many feasible culture areas that remain unexploited, a number of bays and estuaries have become overstocked with culture resulting in reduced growth of mussels and lower product yield. In this case, suspended food particles (seston) consisting of phytoplankton and detritus seem to be the limiting factor (Grant et al., 1993). In addition to limiting mussel production, high density culture has the potential to direct biodeposits to the benthos where eutrophication and attendant oxygen stress ensue. Together these effects make up the criteria for carrying capacity defined as (a) the stocking density at which growth is not food limited, and/or (b) the stocking density at which some measure of ecosystem health is not compromised. Although environmental monitoring or mussel growth studies can detect these extremes, it would be useful to predict them in advance to avoid harm to the environment and to the livelihood of culturists. These predictions allow maintenance of a sustainable industry, the latter term defined as culture levels below the above expressions of carrying capacity. This has been the focus of previous modelling studies including Grant et al. (1993), Dowd (1997), Campbell and Newell (1998), and Dowd (2005). Although exceedance of carrying capacity creates a pressing need for these models, they are also useful in planning sustainable culture as it develops in new locations. One promising area in Canada is the Magdalen Islands (Iles-de-la-Madeleine, Qu\u00e9bec), a small archipelago in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Its shallow interior lagoons are surrounded by barrier beaches with narrow inlets to the sea, and have thus far been ideal for suspended mussel culture. The northern of two lagoons, Lagune de la Grande-Entr\u00e9e (Grand Entry Lagoon, GEL) has a single mussel farm and a smaller scallop farm. In order to assist with sustainable development of the farmed region, we developed a simulation model of mussel growth in the context of the trophic structure of the lagoon ecosystem. Ecosystem modelling has a growing tradition in the management of both shellfish and finfish aquaculture (e.g. Dowd, 2005). Its underlying basis is a tidal circulation model, which couples coastal bays or estuaries to the ocean and allows transport of seston as food and removal of waste products. For GEL, the lagoon was partitioned into four boxes representing different regions to distill the results of a circulation model into exchange coefficients that provided communication between the boxes. The trophic model was developed with highly configurable GUI-based software (Simile) that allows explicit coupling between boxes. Using this approach, we provide estimates of mussel growth and culture yield as a function of culture density and location. We explore the potential for expansion of the farm and the consequences of expansion for mussel meat weight. Results quantify the increase in culture feasibility at this site through use of a modular model that can easily be ported to other systems. Below we describe the model, its sensitivity to parameter variation, its validation with field data, and its application in aquaculture management. 2 Ecosystem model 2.1 Overview The Magdalen Islands are located within the central Gulf of St. Lawrence in eastern Canada, with GEL located at the northeast end of the largest island (Fig. 1 ). It is the largest lagoon on the island with a surface area of 58km2 and average depth at low tide of 3m (Mayzaud et al., 1992). Water depths are <3m in most of the areas occupied by Boxes 2\u20134 (Fig. 1). The lagoon exchanges water with the Gulf of St. Lawrence through the Grande-Entr\u00e9e pass to the south, and to a lesser extent with the House Harbour lagoon located to the southwest (Koutitonsky et al., 2002). The cross-sectional area for water exchange at the two boundaries are approximately 3300 and 300m2, respectively (Drapeau, 1988), with water renewal between GEL and the Gulf of St. Lawrence occurring every 12\u201320 days (Koutitonsky et al., 2002). Circulation in GEL is described in Koutitonsky et al. (2002). In the box model, exchange between adjacent boxes was parameterised as per day (day\u22121) based on the results of the 2D numerical model AquaDyn (http://www.technum.com; see Grant and Bacher, 2001; Grant et al., 2005). The four boxes have volumes of 38.9, 55.9, 36.5, and 47.1millionm3, respectively. Exchange across a boundary between two boxes was assumed equal in both directions. Patterns of circulation and current speeds in AquaDyn were verified via comparison to a validated 3D model of GEL (Koutitonsky et al., 2002). Differing exchange coefficients across multiple boundaries for a given box allow for the difference in volume between adjacent boxes. This ensures the conservation of water mass within the modelled domain. These summarised exchange results indicate that tidal forcing is stronger at the ocean boundary of GEL (volume exchange=0.26day\u22121) compared to the boundary of House Harbour Lagoon (0.04day\u22121). Because Boxes 1 and 2 share a boundary near the GEL inlet, their exchange rate is also high (0.12day\u22121). As expected, turnover decreases toward the interior of GEL, with Box 2 weakly communicating with Box 3 (0.05day\u22121) and Box 4 (0.03day\u22121). The innermost parts of GEL have the lowest exchange (Boxes 3\u20134=0.01day\u22121). Mussels are cultured in the Magdalen Islands using a variation of longline approaches, with continuous socking that loops between floats rather than hanging as separate vertical socks. There are 332 longlines within the existing farm area of 2.53km2 (outlined in Box 3, Fig. 1). Mussels are generally socked in October, with limited harvest in December of the following year, and remaining harvest in spring through fall of the second year. Despite simultaneous culture of two cohorts, we combine their numbers into a single density as detailed below. 2.2 Description The trophic model was established using Simile software (http://www.simulistics.com) following the form of a basic PNZ model with the addition of detritus and other grazers in the form of mussels (Fig. 1). The concentration for each state variable per box was tracked through time, using organic carbon as the model currency (mg Cm\u22123). The model accounted for exchange of state variable concentrations between adjacent GEL boxes, as well as exchanges at far-field boundaries. The equations build upon earlier work (Grant et al., 1993; Dowd, 1997; Dowd, 2005), which is based upon the classic formulations in Kremer and Nixon (1978). Six differential equations describe the ecosystem box model. 2.2.1 Rate of change of mussel mass Mussel mass growth rate dM W/dt (mg Cday\u22121) is the focus of the box model. It is given by: (1) d M W d t = c M M W [ \u03b5 M f MI I M \u2212 f MRS \u03b2 MRS \u2212 \u03c3 \u03b3 M \u03b5 M f MI I M ] where c M is the dimensionless constant that accounts for the presence of mussels in a box (value of 0 or 1), M W the mass per mussel (mg C), \u025b M the dimensionless assimilation term, f MI the dimensionless mussel ingestion function, I M the ingestion rate of mussels (day\u22121), f MRS the dimensionless mussel standard respiration function, \u03b2 MRS the standard respiration rate (day\u22121), and \u03c3 \u03b3M is the dimensionless cost of growth coefficient. The first term on the right hand side of Eq. (1) accounts for increased mussel mass due to feeding. The second and third terms account for decreased mass per mussel due to standard respiration and active metabolic processes associated with feeding, respectively. The feeding efficiency variable \u025b M in Eq. (1) is: (2) \u03b5 M = \u03b5 MP P + \u03b5 MD \u03bc M D P + \u03bc M D where \u025b MP is the dimensionless phytoplankton assimilation efficiency for mussels, \u025b MD the dimensionless detritus assimilation efficiency, P the phytoplankton concentration (mg Cm\u22123), D the detritus concentration (mg Cm\u22123), and \u03bc M is the dimensionless feeding preference coefficient for mussels. The active respiration variable f MI is: (3) f MI = c MI e Q MI T P + D k M + P + D M W M WRef b MI where c MI is the dimensionless scaling constant that assures a value of unity at a specified mussel reference mass, Q MI the temperature rate constant for mussel ingestion (\u00b0C\u22121), T the temperature (\u00b0C), k M the half-saturation coefficient for mussels (mg Cm\u22123), M WRef the mussel reference mass at a known temperature used for scaling (mg C), and b MI is the dimensionless allometric exponent for mussel ingestion. Last, the standard respiration variable f MRS is: (4) f MRS = c MRS e Q MRS T M W M WRef b MR where c MRS is the dimensionless scaling constant that assures a value of unity at a specified mussel reference mass, Q MRS the temperature rate constant for standard respiration of mussels (\u00b0C\u22121), and b MR is the dimensionless allometric exponent for mussel respiration. The model does not consider mussel mortality since population processes are not modelled. 2.2.2 Rate of change of detritus concentration The rate of change of detrital matter concentration, dD/dt (mg Cm\u22123 day\u22121) is given by: (5) d D d t = K XO ( D \u221e \u2212 D ) + K XB ( D XB \u2212 D ) \u2212 \u03c9 s h D \u2212 c M \u03bc M D P + \u03bc M D f MI I M M W M N \u2212 \u03bc Z D P + \u03bc Z D f ZI I Z Z where K XO is the far-field exchange coefficient (day\u22121), D \u221e the far-field detrital matter concentration (mg Cm\u22123), K XB the exchange coefficient between adjacent boxes (day\u22121), D XB the detrital matter concentration from adjacent boxes (mg Cm\u22123), \u03c9 s the settling velocity of detrital matter (mday\u22121), h the water depth (m), c M, \u03bc M, f MI, I M, and M W are defined above, M N is mussel density (musselsm\u22123), \u03bc Z the dimensionless feeding preference coefficient for zooplankton, f ZI the dimensionless assimilation ingestion function for zooplankton, I Z the ingestion rate of detrital matter by zooplankton (day\u22121), and Z is the zooplankton concentration (mg Cm\u22123). The terms on the right hand side of Eq. (5) account for detrital matter exchange at the far-field interface (e.g. House Harbour Lagoon and Gulf of St. Lawrence), detrital matter exchange between adjacent boxes, detrital matter deposition, detrital matter ingestion by mussels, and detrital matter ingestion by zooplankton, respectively. In Eq. (5), the feeding variable f ZI is: (6) f ZI = c ZI e Q ZI T D + P k Z + D + P where c ZI is the dimensionless scaling constant, Q ZI is temperature rate constant for zooplankton ingestion (\u00b0C\u22121), and k Z is the half-saturation coefficient for zooplankton (mg Cm\u22123). 2.2.3 Rate of change of phytoplankton concentration The rate of change of phytoplankton concentration dP/dt (mg Cm\u22123 day\u22121) is given by: (7) d P d t = K XO ( P \u221e \u2212 P ) + K XB ( P XB \u2212 P ) + \u03b3 P \u03b6 k \u03b6 \u2212 \u03b6 P \u2212 c M ( 1 + c f ) P P + \u03bc M D f MI I M M W M N \u2212 P P + \u03bc Z D f ZI I Z Z \u2212 \u03bb P P where P \u221e is the far-field phytoplankton concentration (mg Cm\u22123), P XB the phytoplankton concentration from adjacent boxes (mg Cm\u22123), \u03b3 P the mean daily phytoplankton growth rate (day\u22121), \u03b6 the limiting nutrient concentration (mg Nm\u22123), k \u03b6 the half-saturation coefficient for the limiting nutrient (mg Nm\u22123), c f the dimensionless constant that accounts for fouling at the aquaculture site by natural organisms (a value between 0 and 1), and \u03bb P the phytoplankton mortality rate (day\u22121). The remaining terms are outlined below. The terms on the right hand side of Eq. (7) account for phytoplankton exchange at the far-field interface, phytoplankton exchange with adjacent boxes, growth of phytoplankton, ingestion of phytoplankton by mussels, ingestion of phytoplankton by zooplankton, and phytoplankton mortality, respectively. The phytoplankton growth variable \u03b3 P in Eq. (7) is a function of day length and incidental irradiance. It is given by: (8) \u03b3 P = P max e Q \u03b3 P T I P where P max is the maximum phytoplankton growth rate (day\u22121), Q \u03b3 P the temperature rate constant for phytoplankton growth (\u00b0C\u22121), and I P is the dimensionless photosynthesis-irradiance function given by: (9) I P = e L k d h ( e \u2212 ( e ( \u2212 k d h ) I \u00af ) / I O \u2212 e \u2212 I \u00af / I O ) In Eq. (9), k d is the attenuation coefficient (m\u22121), I \u00af the depth-averaged incidental irradiance (lyday\u22121), I O the optimum illumination for photosynthesis (lyday\u22121), and L is the fractional photoperiod relative to a 24h day (day\u22121). The values of I \u00af and L are given by: (10) I \u00af = 100 + 50 sin 2 \u03c0 365 ( t \u2212 83.1 ) and (11) L = 0.5 \u2212 0.125 cos 2 \u03c0 365 ( t + 11 ) where t is the time-step, or day of year in the model and 365 is the number of days in a year. The growth rate of phytoplankton (Eq. (8)) does not include the effects of cloud cover and self-shading. 2.2.4 Rate of change of zooplankton concentration The rate of change of zooplankton concentration dZ/dt (mg Cm\u22123 day\u22121) is given by: (12) d Z d t = K XO ( Z \u221e \u2212 Z ) + K XB ( Z XB \u2212 Z ) + \u03b5 Z f ZI I Z Z \u2212 f ZR \u03b2 ZR Z \u2212 \u03bb Z Z where Z \u221e is the far-field zooplankton concentration (mg Cm\u22123), Z XB the zooplankton concentration from adjacent boxes (mg Cm\u22123), \u025b Z the dimensionless assimilation term, f ZR the dimensionless zooplankton respiration function, \u03b2 ZR the zooplankton standard respiration rate (day\u22121), and \u03bb Z is the zooplankton mortality rate (day\u22121).

The feeding efficiency variable \u025b Z in Eq. (12) is: (13) \u03b5 Z = \u03b5 ZP P + \u03b5 ZD \u03bc Z D P + \u03bc Z D , where \u025b ZP is the dimensionless assimilation efficiency for consumption of phytoplankton and \u025b ZD is the dimensionless detrital matter assimilation efficiency coefficient. The respiration variable f ZR is: (14) f ZR = c ZR e Q ZR T where c ZR is a dimensionless scaling constant and Q ZR is a temperature rate constant for zooplankton respiration (\u00b0C\u22121). 2.2.5 Rate of change of nitrate and ammonia concentration The limiting nutrient concentration for phytoplankton growth is given by the sum of the nitrate (N N) and ammonia (N A) concentrations in the water column, represented by \u03b6 (mg Nm\u22123). The rate of change of nitrate concentration dN N/dt (mg Nm\u22123 day\u22121) is given by: (15) d N N d t = K XO ( N N \u221e \u2212 N N ) + K XB ( N NXB \u2212 N N ) \u2212 N N k \u03b6 + \u03b6 \u03b3 P P C / N P where N N\u221e is the far-field nitrate concentration (mg Nm\u22123), N NXB the nitrate concentration from adjacent boxes (mg Nm\u22123), and P C/N is the carbon\u2013nitrogen ratio for phytoplankton mg CmgN\u22121. The terms on the right hand side of Eq. (15) account for nitrate exchange at the far-field interface, exchange with adjacent boxes, and uptake of nitrate by phytoplankton, respectively. The rate of change of the ammonia concentration dN A/dt (mg Nm\u22123 day\u22121) is given by: (16) d N A d t = K XO ( N A \u221e \u2212 N A ) + K XB ( N AXB \u2212 N A ) \u2212 \u03be Z + M \u2212 N A k \u03b6 + \u03b6 \u03b3 P P C / N P where N A\u221e is the far-field ammonia concentration (mg Nm\u22123), N AXB the ammonia concentration from adjacent boxes (mg Nm\u22123), and \u03be Z+M represents the addition of ammonia from zooplankton and mussel excretion (mg Nm\u22123 day\u22121). The terms on the right hand side of Eq. (16) account for ammonia exchange at the far-field interface, exchange with adjacent boxes, contribution of ammonia from zooplankton and mussel excretion, and uptake of ammonia by phytoplankton, respectively. The term \u03be Z+M in Eq. (16) is: (17) \u03be Z + M = f ZR \u03b2 ZR Z Z C / N + c M ( f MRS \u03b2 MRS + \u03c3 \u03b3 M \u03b5 M f MI I M ) M N M C / N where Z C/N is the carbon\u2013nitrogen ratio for zooplankton (mg CmgN\u22121) and M C/N is the carbon\u2013nitrogen ratio for mussels (mg CmgN\u22121). 2.3 Initialisation, validation, and sensitivity analysis The GEL model was operated on a daily time-step for 1 year and was initialised using daily far-field values for temperature, phytoplankton, zooplankton, detrital matter, nitrate, and ammonia concentrations (Fig. 2 ). The forcing time series values at the Box 1\u2014House Harbour Lagoon boundary and Box 2\u2014Gulf of St. Lawrence boundary were estimated from observations assembled from the literature (Mayzaud et al., 1992; Savenko et al., 2000; Vezina et al., 2000). Concentration ranges were scaled from these references, our own experience in Gulf waters and their seasonal cycles, as well as insight into typical patterns for North Atlantic waters. Obtaining accurate daily far-field forcing values for an entire year is a limitation of many ecosystem models, particularly where seasonal conditions make in situ sampling difficult (e.g. ice cover). Phytoplankton biomass was structured with both a spring and fall bloom, but with higher values for the lagoon boundary than for the shelf boundary. Zooplankton followed a similar pattern with a suitable time lag to that of primary production. Detrital organic matter had a low point in summer, with constant values otherwise. Dissolved nitrate and ammonia were depleted in the middle of the year, and with a lower maximum at the lagoon boundary than at the shelf boundary. The initial state variable concentrations for all boxes were set equal to values for the far-field forcing variables on the first day of the modelled year, which were the same at both far-field exchange boundaries (Fig. 2). Initial detrital matter concentration and water depth were distinct for each box. Initial mussel mass was based on values observed at the existing mussel aquaculture farm within GEL, while mussel density was scaled as mussels per volume of farm relative to the volume of Box 3. Given the density of the 2 year classes and allowing for falloff during growout, the farmed density of the mussels is approximately 1.5musselsm\u22123 of box volume. Expression of mussel density in this format is necessary since the farm is not discretised within the box. An experimental design was developed in order to monitor mussel growth at the farm site in GEL from August 2003 through November 2004. The former corresponded to the cohort socked on October 2003, and the latter to the cohort socked in the same month of the previous year (2002). Pools of 20 mussels obtained from collected spat or cultured stock in the Magdalen Islands were placed in vexar cages hung on nine 30m longlines distributed in the mussel farm. Each longline carried two cages containing juvenile mussels (initial yearclass) and two other cages containing 10-month-old mussels from the previous year's cohort. The latter cages were placed on longlines on 4 July 2003, while year 0 cages were emplaced on 2 October 2003 when juveniles were available. Cages were deployed at a water depth of 3.5m. The model was validated by comparison of observed data with model predictions for mussel growth, and nitrate and phytoplankton concentrations in Box 3 versus measurements made at the existing GEL farm. Monthly measurements of shell length were carried out on two cohorts grown in vexar cages hung on longlines between July and December 2003, and between May and November 2004. Meat weight (mg dry weightmussel\u22121) was estimated from measurements obtained from socked mussels of two monitored age groups. Forty mussels per age group were randomly sampled each month. Mussels were assumed to contain 40% dry weight carbon (Grant et al., 1993). Measurements of phytoplankton biomass were estimated from continuous fluorometer records, while water samples were used to characterise nitrates (T. Guyondet, unpublished data). Sensitivity analysis followed the Plackett\u2013Burman design for optimum multifactorial experiments of multi-parametered models (Plackett and Burman, 1946; Beres and Hawkins, 2001). We tested a range for 12 model parameters due to the large range associated with their default value, as documented in the literature (Table 1 ). Parameters that were better constrained were not tested for sensitivity. For the sensitivity analysis, parameters were manipulated about their range as specified by the Plackett\u2013Burman design for 12 parameters. As response variables for the sensitivity analysis we selected modelled output of mussel mass (Box 3) at the end of the first growing year, and four variables based on water column concentrations in each box on the date of maximum far-field value for that variable: detritus, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and ammonia. 3 Results 3.1 Validation Because mussel growth trials were conducted in 2 years, there are two sets of validation data, and simulations were run with initial weights and growth periods matched to each year, but with the same boundary conditions simulated growth shows a linear increase in tissue weight during the modelled months (Fig. 3 ). In comparison, observed growth from 2003 is initially slow and then experiences more rapid growth in summer, but with a similar slope to the modelled growth for much of the year. Absolute meat size is displaced from model predictions such that the observed tissue weight is \u223c40% greater (Fig. 3). Growth data from 2004 indicates a closer agreement with the model predictions (Fig. 3). It should be emphasised that the boundary conditions used to force the model were based on composite time series from multiple years of observations, and do not necessarily reflect the nuances of a single year. In contrast, the observed growth is a function of specific environmental conditions for the year in which growth experiments were conducted. There is considerable variation in individual growth of cultured mussels (Fig. 3). For nitrate and phytoplankton concentrations, tidal forcing generally causes the modelled results to resemble the boundary conditions (Fig. 3). Ground-truthing using these variables is limited by the shorter duration of their data records. The time series of simulated nitrate concentration conforms to the observed summer lows for this nutrient (Fig. 3). Simulated phytoplankton concentration within Box 3 corresponds closely to the magnitude of an observed peak, but is displaced later in the year compared to the observed values (Fig. 3). This discrepancy likely arises because phytoplankton in the GEL model is driven by the far-field concentration idealised from historic data over several years (Fig. 2), which may not capture dynamics of the observed phytoplankton concentration collected in 2003. As suggested for mussel growth, this inevitably leads to a simulated response that need not match the observations for a given year. The best ground-truth scenario involves observations from several years so that the simulation results may be interpreted within a range of natural variability. Despite limitations in validation, we maintain that model results provide a reasonable foundation in which to assess different aquaculture development scenarios within GEL. 3.2 Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity of model outcomes to parameter manipulation was similar for all boxes, even in the absence of mussels, so the discussion herein focuses only on Box 3, with reference to the other boxes when appropriate (Fig. 4 , refer to Table 1 parameter description). In addition, this analysis does not include the effect of parameter manipulation on nitrate concentration, since model responses to parameter manipulation for nitrate concentration were similar to those observed for ammonia. In the Plackett\u2013Burman approach, the direction of parameter sensitivity reflects the relationship of the parameter to the given outcome. For example, allometric coefficient b MI has a positive relationship with mussel tissue weight, as it influences the rate of mussel ingestion and hence growth of mussels (Fig. 4). In contrast, b MR has a negative relationship with mussel mass at the end of the year, as it influences the rate of mussel respiration that results in a loss of mussel mass. Similarly, b MI is negatively related to detrital concentration in Box 3, as increased mussel ingestion results in a decrease in the detritus via mussel feeding. It is emphasised that the scales of sensitivity values are relative within each response variable. For mussel mass at the end of the year, increased mass is sensitive to bioenergetic parameters b MI, \u025b MD, I M, and zooplankton population parameter \u03bb Z. Increased mussel mass is dependent on mussel ingestion, so it is not surprising that it is sensitive to b MI, I M, and \u025b MD (Fig. 4). Mussels are also in competition with zooplankton for food, resulting in mussels having a positive sensitivity to zooplankton mortality rate. Comparatively, mussel mass growth displays a similar sensitivity to b MI and I M, which exhibit approximately a 1.5 and 2 times higher sensitivity response of the outcome compared to \u025b MD and \u03bb Z, respectively. In contrast, tissue mass is negatively sensitive to parameters b MR, \u03b2 MRS, \u03c3 \u03b3M, \u03bb P, and k \u03b6. Loss of mussel mass occurs as a result of respiration, so the outcome is sensitive to b MR, \u03b2 MRS, and \u03c3 \u03b3M, while mussels also rely on phytoplankton as a food source, resulting in the outcome being sensitive to \u03bb P and k \u03b6, which decrease phytoplankton abundance. Mussel mass exhibits a similar negative sensitivity to b MR, \u03b2 MRS, \u03c3 \u03b3M, and k \u03b6. The loss of mussel mass is on average 1.5 times more sensitive to phytoplankton mortality than the other parameters, emphasising the importance of phytoplankton as a food source for mussels in the model. Detrital matter concentration observed in all boxes during the annual peak in its far-field concentration was examined as a sensitivity response variable since it reflects the time when detrital matter inside the system is also high. For peak detrital matter concentration (D) in Box 3, increased concentration is sensitive to the parameter \u03b2 ZR, as zooplankton respiration regulates the growth of zooplankton, and hence their uptake of detrital matter as a food source (Fig. 4). In contrast, decreased detrital matter is sensitive to b MI, \u025b MD, and I Z, since mussels consume detritus in the absence of phytoplankton availability. On average, detritus concentration is five times more sensitive to \u03b2 ZR than the other parameters exhibiting positive sensitivity values, while decreased detritus is two times more sensitive to I Z than b MI and \u025b MD. This suggests that detrital matter concentration in Box 3 is more sensitive to zooplankton than mussels. Peak phytoplankton concentration (P) in Box 3 is only sensitive to \u03bb P, which results in decreased phytoplankton concentration when the phytoplankton mortality rate is increased (Fig. 4). On average, the outcome is 11 times more sensitive to \u03bb P than the other parameters suggesting that phytoplankton concentration is not sensitive to zooplankton or the presence of mussels. Similarly, peak zooplankton concentration (Z) is sensitive to b ZR, I Z, and \u03bb P, as increased zooplankton ingestion rate increases zooplankton biomass, while increased zooplankton respiration and mortality decrease zooplankton biomass (Fig. 4). On average, increased zooplankton concentration is five times more sensitive to I Z than the other parameters with positive sensitivity values, while decreased concentration is 1.6 times more sensitive to b ZR than \u03bb P. This suggests that zooplankton concentration in Box 3 is influenced more by zooplankton ingestion and respiration than mortality. Last, the ammonia concentration (N A) in Box 3 is sensitive to k d and \u03bb P as ammonia levels are related to uptake of ammonia by phytoplankton, as phytoplankton concentrations are low when k d and \u03bb P are high (Fig. 4). In summary, mussel mass at the end of the year is sensitive to changes in parameters associated with mussel ingestion and respiration, which promote or compromise growth, respectively. Mussel mass is also sensitive to increased phytoplankton mortality, as a reduction in phytoplankton as a food source leads to decreased mussel growth. Similarly, mussel mass is sensitive to increased zooplankton mortality, as a reduction in zooplankton abundance reduces the competition for food with mussels and supports increased mussel growth by the end of the year. The peak detritus concentration is affected by zooplankton abundance via ingestion of detrital matter as a food source, while mussels also influence detrital matter concentration by way of ingestion. Phytoplankton are not sensitive to mussels, zooplankton, or the light attenuation coefficient, which suggests that phytoplankton abundance is primarily determined by the far-field concentration and not processes occurring within the modelled domain. Zooplankton, however, are sensitive to parameters that reflect their own bioenergetics rather than by the presence of mussels as a competitor. Mussels however are sensitive to their own bioenergetics as well as negatively influenced by the presence of zooplankton. Last, nutrient depletion is dependent on the phytoplankton concentration and hence the rates at which nutrients are consumed by primary production. 3.3 Trophodynamics Modelled scenarios for Box 3 were performed in the absence of mussels and zooplankton, absence of mussels and presence of zooplankton, absence of zooplankton and presence of mussels, and presence of zooplankton and mussels (Fig. 5 ). These simulations assumed a default mussel density of 1.5musselsm\u22123. The time series output from these model runs indicate that phytoplankton concentrations for all modelled scenarios are similar throughout the spring bloom, with only a small decrease in the peak phytoplankton concentration from 273 to 261mg Cm\u22123 on day 114 in the case where mussels were present in Box 3 (Fig. 5). Throughout the summer phytoplankton remained low for all scenarios. During the fall phytoplankton bloom, however, increased mussel biomass later in the growing year had a larger effect on the phytoplankton concentration, as the peak phytoplankton concentration decreased from 133 to 100mg Cm\u22123 on day 312, when mussels were present in Box 3 (Fig. 5). Zooplankton grazing impacts on phytoplankton were always minimal. Examination of nitrate as a second response variable indicates that the modelled concentration throughout the year is inversely related to the phytoplankton concentration since phytoplankton consume nitrate (Fig. 5). The effect of mussels in Box 3 on phytoplankton is reflected by the slight increase in nitrate following the fall bloom, as mussels ingest more phytoplankton resulting in decreased uptake of nitrate by primary producers. In the presence of mussels, the nitrate concentration is 11% greater at the end of the modelled year than in the absence of mussels. Ammonia is often a factor of two greater in the presence of mussels, with the greatest difference observed between the early summer and end of the modelled year (Fig. 5). The increased ammonia concentration is primarily due to the excretion of ammonia by mussels, while consumption of phytoplankton by mussels contributes to increased ammonia later in the year, as there is less phytoplankton uptake of nutrients. In the presence of zooplankton, however, the ammonia concentration increased only slightly due to zooplankton excretion and consumption of phytoplankton by zooplankton. For detrital matter, a rapid decrease in concentration is observed during the first 20 days of the modelled year, as the system reaches equilibrium between advection of detrital matter into GEL from the far-field and consumption of detrital matter by mussels when phytoplankton concentrations are low (Fig. 5). In general, detrital matter concentration remains relatively uniform throughout the year, although a decrease in concentration is observed during the late summer when the far-field concentration is also low. In the presence of mussels in Box 3, the detritus is about 12% lower throughout the modelled year, with the greatest difference occurring later in the growing year when phytoplankton concentration is also low. As the model stipulates, mussels become dependent on detritus when phytoplankton are low, but at reduced absorption efficiency. Since phytoplankton are abundant in Box 3 throughout most of the modelled year, mussels do not significantly affect the detrital matter concentration. 4 Discussion Results in Fig. 5 suggest that at the current stocking density of mussels in Box 3, mussel aquaculture does not exhibit major effects on other ecosystem components, while zooplankton exhibit negligible impacts on the system via phytoplankton consumption. At the current density of mussels in Box 3 of GEL, phytoplankton and detrital matter decreased only later in the growing year, when mussels were large and ingested more food. This resulted in increased nitrate and ammonia concentrations via excretion from mussels, as well as decreased uptake by phytoplankton since their concentration was lower. Last, under the current stocking density in Box 3 of GEL, mussels exhibited negligible effects on the phytoplankton, nitrate, ammonia, and detrital matter concentrations in other GEL boxes, so the results were not presented. When mussel growth becomes a decreasing function of cultured biomass, the stocking density of mussels has reached its carrying capacity (Odum, 1983). We use the model to project stocking density to higher values, and examine individual tissue mass as a response variable (Fig. 6 ). These simulations are conducted for stocking scenarios involving permutations of Boxes 2\u20134. Because response variables are plotted against stocking density, it was necessary to capture aspects of dynamic variables (mussel growth, phytoplankton production), as single values defined below. The present aquaculture farm stocking density is equivalent to 1.5musselsm\u22123 averaged over all of Box 3 (i.e. within and beyond the farm). At this stocking density, the individual mussel mass at the end of the full modelled year is 535mg C (initial weight January 1=84mg C). This carbon tissue weight multiplied by the volume of the box, stocking density, and whole wet weight to dry tissue weight provides a total commercial yield for each box. We define excess phytoplankton as the annual sum of daily phytoplankton carbon biomass (i.e. excess remaining after grazing), as a means of condensing residual primary production into a single response value to mussel grazing. As detailed below, both tissue weight and excess phytoplankton show exponential declines to asymptotic values with increasing stocking density. If the stocking density is doubled to 3musselsm\u22123 in Box 3, the individual mussel mass at the end of the year is 478mg Cind\u22121, total mussel yield is 52tonnes C, and phytoplankton concentration 557tonnes Cyear\u22121. The doubling of stocking density in Box 3 results in an 11% decrease in mussel mass per individual and a 15% decrease in excess phytoplankton, while there is an 80% increase in the total mass of mussels produced by the end of the year. At a stocking density of 10musselsm\u22123, the individual mussel mass at the end of the year is 297mg Cmussel\u22121, total excess phytoplankton over the year is 313tonnes Cyear\u22121, and total mussel mass produced is 108tonnes C (Fig. 6). This results in a decreased mussel mass per individual of 44% and decreased total excess phytoplankton of 52%, while the total mass of mussels produced by the end of the year increased by a factor of 3.7. In general, when mussel stocking density is increased, individual mussel mass and excess phytoplankton are inversely related to total mussel yield. Thus, the optimum stocking density for mussel aquaculture in Box 3 is defined by the minimum acceptable mussel size for sale at market, since increased production corresponds to decreased mass per individual. Because phytoplankton are in excess in Box 3, even at a mussel stocking density of 20musselsm\u22123, the existing aquaculture farm in Box 3 could increase in size without consuming all phytoplankton in the box. As mussel density increases, internally produced phytoplankton are consumed, and it is the magnitude of phytoplankton production renewed from offshore (spring and fall peaks) that sustains mussel growth in GEL. For this reason, there is a positive energy balance for mussels even at higher densities. In the next series of simulations, new mussel farms were added to Boxes 2 and 4 to observe the effect of aquaculture development in other regions of GEL and the impacts they may have on the farm in Box 3 (Fig. 6). In this exercise, mussel aquaculture was not added to Box 1 due to various depth and access factors that prevent development. When mussel aquaculture was located in Boxes 2 and 3 at equivalent stocking densities, individual tissue weight, total mussel production, and total excess phytoplankton were greater in Box 2 than in Box 3 for all stocking densities (Fig. 6). Locating aquaculture in Box 2 caused negative impacts on mussel growth in Box 3, as the individual tissue weight at the end of the growing year for a stocking density of 10musselsm\u22123 decreased from 297 to 251mg Cind\u22121. The total mussel production and excess phytoplankton in Box 3 also decreased from 108 to 92tonnes C and 313\u2013281tonnes Cyear\u22121, respectively, at a stocking density of 10musselsm\u22123 in Boxes 2 and 3. In Box 2 at the highest stocking density of 20musselsm\u22123, the individual tissue weight was 716mg Cind\u22121, total mussel mass produced was 801tonnes C, and excess phytoplankton was 811tonnes Cyear\u22121, suggesting that Box 2 would be a good location for future aquaculture development despite some negative impacts on culture in Box 3 (Fig. 6). The likely reason for high mussel growth and production in Box 2 is its proximity to phytoplankton advection from the Gulf of St. Lawrence into GEL, providing an abundant food source for mussels. When mussel aquaculture was located in Boxes 3 and 4 at equivalent stocking densities, individual tissue weight was similar in both boxes for all stocking densities, while the total mussel production and excess phytoplankton concentration were higher in Box 4 due to its larger volume compared to Box 3 (Fig. 6). Locating aquaculture in Box 4 exhibited slightly negative impacts on mussel growth in Box 3, as the individual tissue weight at the end of the growing year for a stocking density of 10musselsm\u22123 decreased from 297 to 286mg Cmussels\u22121. The total mussel production and excess phytoplankton in Box 3 also decreased from 108 to 105tonnes C and 313\u2013276tonnes Cyear\u22121 respectively, at a stocking density of 10musselsm\u22123 in Boxes 3 and 4 (Fig. 6). The slightly higher mussel growth and production in Box 4 is due to its higher exchange of phytoplankton with Boxes 1 and 2 compared to Box 3, as well as its larger volume that allows more mussels to be grown in the box. In general, individual tissue weight at all stocking densities was similar for Boxes 3 and 4, while the greater excess phytoplankton and larger volume of Box 4 suggests that mussel aquaculture could be as successful in Box 4 as it is for the existing farm in Box 3. Furthermore, development in both boxes does not compromise mussel growth and production at either location, as compared to Box 2 that compromises mussel growth in Box 3. Last, when mussel aquaculture was located in Boxes 2, 3, and 4 at equivalent stocking densities, individual tissue weight, total mussel production, and excess phytoplankton concentration decreased in all boxes (Fig. 6). The greatest decrease occurred in Box 3, followed by Boxes 4 and 2, respectively. For all boxes, however, excess phytoplankton was observed even at the highest stocking density of 20musselsm\u22123, indicating that at high mussel stocking densities throughout GEL, phytoplankton remain extant within the system. Moreover, mussels did not starve to zero tissue weight even at high stocking densities. In addition to phytoplankton, the high concentration of detrital matter and its continual tidal renewal, support some level of mussel growth despite increased stocking density. Fig. 6 demonstrates that at equivalent stocking densities throughout GEL, mussel growth and production will be compromised at high stocking densities. Aquaculture development in Boxes 2 and 4, however, suggest that greater gains in mussel growth and production in these boxes may outweigh losses in Box 3. It should be reiterated though, that this study assumed an equivalent mussel stocking density in all boxes, while a combination of different stocking densities could maximise mussel growth and production in all boxes at a minimum cost to adjacent farms. Although the current level of mussel aquaculture in GEL does not appear to alter natural biophysical processes throughout the lagoon, the reverse situation of ecosystem effects on mussel culture is significant since phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance have an influence on mussel growth. As indicated above, mussel mass at the end of the year is sensitive to changes in parameters associated with mussel ingestion and respiration, as well as phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality. For GEL, an ecosystem box model has been used in the context of shellfish culture to examine commercial carrying capacity and stocking density, and to quantify the impact of culture on other ecosystem components. In the former case, similar models to our effort have been constructed for oyster culture in European estuaries (Raillard and Menesguen, 1994; Ferreira et al., 1998; Bacher et al., 1998). In other cases, box models have been used to examine shellfish effects on biodeposition and nitrogen cycling, with less emphasis on bivalve bioenergetics and more emphasis on bivalves as a forcing function (Chapelle et al., 2000; Dowd, 2005). Although these models share a common ability to quantify density-dependent effects of shellfish culture, they differ in aspects such as the extent of culture, the influence of flushing versus internal primary production, and number and size of boxes. Our study contributes to the advancement of a box model approach in several ways. First, the model is constructed in Simile, an object-based modelling environment. The box model of Ferreira et al. (1998) uses object-oriented modelling, but Simile is a step further removed from code, and more accessible for transfer to non-experts. Moreover, Simile has inherent ability to represent spatial elements, and specify their hydrodynamic connections, making it ideal for box modelling. Finally, we have attempted to use the model for expanding the cultivation to new areas, and maintaining sustainable culture levels. These predictions have been undertaken with consistent densities within each box, but there may be further gains in yields if there is variable stocking among boxes. The latter case is an optimisation problem that we are presently undertaking using genetic algorithms, providing even greater utility of the box model. The predictive capability of the GEL box model outlined in this study will be improved as temporally detailed far-field phytoplankton, zooplankton, and nutrient concentrations are integrated into the model, and more spatially detailed modelling efforts are undertaken. Furthermore, integration of dual mussel cohorts, falloff mortality, and harvest periods will add to the temporal realism of the model, as incorporated into assessments of carrying capacity elsewhere (Ferreira et al., 1998; Gagnery et al., 2001). Our work did not address farm-scale effects of mussel stocking density that may deplete phytoplankton concentrations within the area of longlines (Strohmeier et al., 2005). 5 Conclusions Mussel aquaculture has the ability to influence ecosystem processes within coastal embayments due to shellfish capacity to filter large volumes of water, regenerate nutrients, and expel particulate wastes (Smaal and Heral, 1998). In order to predict the effects of mussel aquaculture development on the environment and on mussel yield, it is important that bivalve bioenergetics as well as bivalve\u2013ecosystem interactions be considered (Prins et al., 1998). In this study, a spatiotemporal ecosystem box model was used to evaluate carrying capacity for mussel culture in a relatively new aquaculture development area located in eastern Canada. The GEL site provides a unique opportunity to follow aquaculture from a low level of activity to an expanded use of the lagoon for shellfish farming, and providing an opportunity to develop and refine predictive ecosystem models. The results of this work indicate that further aquaculture development could occur within GEL, even at higher stocking densities throughout the lagoon, without exhausting phytoplankton or severely compromising adjacent aquaculture sites. This is particularly true at lower stocking densities throughout the lagoon, which are optimal in terms of the mussel mass per individual that can be sold at market. Results suggest that aquaculture can be expanded in Box 3 to yield greater overall production, although higher stocking densities compromise the mass of individual mussels. Rather than viewing carrying capacity as a single value, farmers or managers must balance stocking density and market size to target commercial yield and profitability. Beyond the present farm site, aquaculture development in Box 2 exhibits a negative impact on mussel growth in Box 3, while development in Box 4 exhibits minimum negative impact on mussel growth in Box 3. The advantages to aquaculture development in Boxes 2 and 4, compared to further development in Box 3, include higher excess phytoplankton concentrations due to greater exchange with the far-field, and greater box volumes that support larger aquaculture development and higher annual mussel production. Alternatively, aquaculture throughout GEL could be developed at different stocking densities within each box, which would minimise the effects of development in adjacent boxes on mussel growth and production. Box models remain a valuable first approach to culture management whose accessibility makes them an important tool in assessing carrying capacity. For this reason they are emerging from the research realm into practical application to commercial scale aquaculture. Additional refinements including spatial optimisation of culture density and incorporation of culture strategies will further their utility in assisting management of the culture industry. The GEL site provides a unique opportunity to follow the development of mussel aquaculture within a coastal embayment and improve understanding of mussel aquaculture\u2013ecosystem dynamics using predictive models. In concert with our efforts, a more detailed model is currently being developed for GEL, including 3D circulation. As of now, the easier-to-use box model serves as a tool for guiding aquaculture development in GEL.

A multiple box ecosystem model for GEL tied to the output of a hydrodynamic model was constructed using Simile software, which has inherent ability to represent spatial elements and specify water exchange between modelled regions. Mussel growth and other field data were used for model validation. Plackett\u2013Burman sensitivity analysis demonstrated that a variety of bioenergetic parameters of zooplankton and phytoplankton submodels were important in model outcomes. Model results demonstrated that mussel aquaculture can be further developed throughout the lagoon. At present culture densities, phytoplankton depletion is minimal, and there is little food limitation of mussel growth. Results indicated that increased stocking density of mussels in the existing farm will lead to decreased mass per individual mussel. Depending on the location of new farm emplacement within the lagoon, implementation of new aquaculture sites either reduced mussel growth in the existing farm due to depletion of phytoplankton, or exhibited minimum negative impact on the existing farm. With development throughout GEL, an excess of phytoplankton was observed during the year in all modelled regions, even at stocking densities as high as 20musselsm\u22123. Although mussels cultured at this density do not substantially impact the ecosystem, their growth is controlled by the flux of phytoplankton food and abundance of zooplankton competitors. This model provides an effective tool to examine expansion of shellfish farming to new areas, balancing culture location and density.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2007-01-10", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304380006003620", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Grant, Jon"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Curran, Kristian J."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Guyondet, Thomas L."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Tita, Guglielmo"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Bacher, C\u00e9dric"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Koutitonsky, Vladimir"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dowd, Michael"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304380006003620"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380006003620"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0304-3800(06)00362-0", "prism:volume": "200", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier B.V.", "dc:title": "A box model of carrying capacity for suspended mussel aquaculture in Lagune de la Grande-Entr\u00e9e, Iles-de-la-Madeleine, Qu\u00e9bec", "prism:copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.
