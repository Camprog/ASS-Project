Abstract Time use models have advanced significantly during the last decade: their theoretical approach has been refined, functional forms have improved and new constraints have been incorporated, among other aspects. However, there is an incipient development of an issue of great importance: the role and influence of external agents on individual time allocation and the recognition of unpaid/domestic work as a distinctive area of research. In this paper we introduce domestic production and the potential domestic work substitution by external providers in a time use model, improving its formulation and the interpretation of the values of time. We take into account the marginal utility of domestic activities, their cost - either if self-produced or hired - and the relation between the domestic output and domestic work hours considering the difference in skills between providers and household members. A stochastic system of equations is proposed and estimated using three Dutch time use and expenses data sets, from which the values of leisure and work are computed and analyzed. Comparative results show that a model with no consideration of hired domestic providers overestimates the values of leisure. Keywords Time values Domestic production External agents Domestic providers 1 Introduction The way people assign their time has been a subject of study since the early years of the twentieth century. As we have stated elsewhere, \u201ctime use studies have been justified primarily by the need to understand how people make decisions about their activities that, by definition, occupy the total time available. The temporal limitation induces the existence of options, so that the decision on the use of time involves an implied and relative valuation of the time allocated to various activities; therefore, use and value are inextricably linked\u201d (Jara-D\u00edaz and Rosales-Salas, 2017). Nevertheless, when looking at the literature altogether, we detected that methodological and theoretical advances have, in general, overlooked the impact of external agents on individual time allocation, particularly domestic help and its interaction with unpaid labor, an area where descriptive and empirical analyses abound but devoid of a theoretical link with time values and its associated time use. Hiring domestic providers has implications for household income, expenditure and family life. On one hand, the availability of a helper could release household members from domestic maintenance and make it possible for them to spend more time either working to earn more income for the household or performing other activities, possibly improving their quality of life. On the other hand, the presence of a helper may affect the privacy of family life and, eventually, individual time allocation. It may also influence households\u2019 spending patterns as hiring a domestic helper can be an important household expenditure commitment. The main purpose of this paper is to enrich the formulation of time use models currently used for the estimation of the underlying values of time, by extending the current approach to consider external help for activities such as household maintenance and childcare. The model we formulate and estimate is aimed at the analysis of how households trade-off hiring domestic providers for productive activities against taking these responsibilities by household members themselves. To do this, new effects have to be considered, namely the value of the individual's own domestic labor, the value of the consumption of domestic goods, the cost of the necessary intermediate goods and external helpers, and the skills of the individuals involved in the production of domestic goods. To the best of our knowledge, no such in-depth model has been reported yet in the time use literature. In the next section we briefly describe the literature on time values and modeling, the research on domestic production and we examine the possible base models to incorporate our contribution. The proposed model is formulated in Section 3. Data is presented and examined in Section 4. In Section 5 we present the estimated models and analyze the results by looking at a base model comparison, at a controlled test of the evolution of individual behavior, and at a context level. Finally, in Section 6 we summarize some of the principal findings, and we discuss the potential for future research. 2 Time use models and time values The first general theory of time allocation within a microeconomic framework was formulated by Becker (1965). There, time use is seen as derived from the maximization of a utility function subject to a time and a budget constraint. After Becker's model - which concluded that time was valued at the wage rate for all time uses - many studies have contributed to the understanding of time allocation and valuation, beginning with approaches in the areas of labor supply and transport, expanding towards other areas such as domestic production and leisure studies. Johnson (1966) was the first to directly incorporate time allocated to an activity (i.e. leisure and work) into the utility function. He proposed that Becker's value of time was incomplete, and was missing an important component: the subjective value of work. Additionally, he stated that the total value of work was equal to the value of leisure, which in turn was also equal to the value of travel time. This was challenged by Oort (1969) who, proposed that not only work and leisure had to be included into the utility function, but also travel time, thus differentiating the value of leisure from the value of travel time. In 1971, DeSerpa made three significant contributions: (i) he directly included goods and all time allocations in the utility function, (ii) he introduced a set of technical constraints linking the consumption of goods with a minimum time assignment, and (iii) he defined three different concepts of time values (value of time as a resource, value of time as a commodity, and the value of saving time in a particular activity). Evans (1972) modified the previous time allocation models by being the first to state a utility depending only on time assigned to activities (Jara-Diaz, 2007). Since then, many studies have made interesting and substantial contributions towards time use and time valuation research. Transport has been a particularly fruitful area of advancement because travel models are implicitly or explicitly related with time use modeling, and with the values of leisure and work. This led to the so-called activity based analysis (see Pinjari and Bhat, 2011, and Ronald et al., 2008 for recent reviews) and to the expansion of time-related microeconomic consumer theory (Jara-D\u00edaz and Guevara, 2003; Jara-D\u00edaz et al., 2008). Within a microeconomic framework, the most general formulation was presented by Jara-D\u00edaz (2003), where he complemented the set of technical constraints of DeSerpa (1971) by showing that goods consumption has a minimum that depends on the activities undertaken; this resulted in a more complete formulation of time values. His model is formulated as follows: (1) M a x U = U ( X , T ) (2) \u2211 P j X j = w T w (3) \u2211 T i = \u03c4 (4) T i \u2265 f i ( X ) (5) X j \u2265 g j ( T ) where U is the utility function, X is the vector of market goods consumed (Xj ) and purchased at their price Pj , T is the vector of time allocated to activities, Ti is the time assigned to activity i, Tw corresponds to the time assigned to work, w is the wage rate and \u03c4 is the length of the period considered. Eqs. (4) and (5) form the set of technical constraints linking goods consumption and time allocation. Later, Jara-Diaz and Guevara (2003) presented a simplified version of this model focused on transport time and its value, which was extended by Jara-Diaz et al., (2008) by including all activities, goods consumption and any discrete choice, to provide new econometric estimations of the value of leisure and time allocation to different activities. (6) max s . a . U = \u03a9 T w \u03b8 w \u220f i T i \u03b8 i \u220f j X j \u03b7 j (7) I f + w T w \u2212 \u2211 j P j X j \u2265 0 \u2192 \u03bb (8) \u03c4 \u2212 T w \u2212 \u2211 i T i = 0 \u2192 \u03bc (9) T i \u2212 T i m i n \u2265 0 \u2200 i \u2192 \u03ba i (10) X j \u2212 X j m i n \u2265 0 \u2200 j \u2192 \u03c6 j Here, \u03b8 i and \u03b7 j are parameters corresponding to activities and goods respectively, \u03a9 is a utility scale, If is fixed income, T i m i n corresponds to an exogenous minimum time restriction for activity i, and X j m i n corresponds to an exogenous minimum goods consumption restriction for market good j (simplifications of Eqs. (4) and (5)). Parameters \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03ba and \u03d5 are the Lagrange multipliers that represent the change in utility when the corresponding constraint is relaxed by one unit. Therefore, \u03bb is the marginal utility of income, \u03bc is the marginal utility of available time, \u03ba i is the marginal utility of diminishing the minimum time of activity i in one unit, and \u03d5 j is the marginal utility of diminishing the minimum consumption of good j in one unit. The choice of a Cobb-Douglas functional form permitted the derivation of an explicit set of equations for the time assigned to work (a labor supply model), for the time assigned to leisure activities and for the consumption of freely chosen goods, where the independent (explanatory) variables are the wage rate, the committed time Tc (the sum of constrained activities) and the committed expenses Ec (sum over expenses in constrained goods minus fixed income If ) . 1 1 Other functional forms such as the CES, Stone-Geary, quadratic or Translog do not lead to closed solutions for the decision variables; values of time cannot be calculated. In spite of some limitations - constant sign of marginal utilities (Prasch, 2000) and no arguments can have a zero value \u2013 the estimates from a Cobb-Douglas formulation can be interpreted as valid in a neighborhood. Once the parameters are estimated using appropriate data, the value of leisure and the value of work can be calculated as: (11) V a l u e o f L e i s u r e = \u03bc \u03bb = \u0398 \u03a6 * ( w T w * \u2212 E c ) ( \u03c4 \u2212 T w * \u2212 T c ) (12) V a l u e o f W o r k = \u2202 U / \u2202 T w \u03bb = \u03b8 w \u03a6 * ( w T w * \u2212 E c ) T w * There is one element that characterizes this evolution from Becker's 1965 model to a formulation like (6)\u2013(10) that has permitted the calculation of distinct values of time as leisure and work: the unitary approach, i.e. one where the decision unit is treated as a single entity, be it an individual or a household, hiding possible interaction among members (a limitation indeed). The approach represented by model (6)\u2013(10) contributed to other advancements in two fronts within the time use modeling literature: a theoretical and empirical collaboration with other time use modeling approaches, and the evolution of the microeconomic-based time use consumer theory. On the first front, the time use related structural equations model (SEM) approach was enriched by considering expenses also, which allowed for the calculation of time values (Konduri et al., 2011) and the emergence of a new concept called the revealed willingness to pay for leisure (RWPL) that, together with the shadow price of time, formed the total value of leisure (Jara-D\u00edaz and Astroza, 2013). Further collaboration between the microeconomic and the activity-based approaches led to an extension of the multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) by incorporating a money budget constraint (Castro et al., 2012). On the second front the microeconomic approach has been enriched by considering generic explicit (linear) constraints relating goods consumption and time use, which led to a stochastic system of equations (Jara-Diaz et al, 2016). As technical relations can also be viewed specifically, in this paper we focus on a specific type of activity at a domestic level. The expansion of consumer theory towards time use modeling has been done by studying and understanding a particular activity, and studying the use of individual time as a whole (Jara-D\u00edaz and Rosales-Salas, 2017). Regarding the study of particular activities, the literature shows three large families of studies: paid work (e.g. Card, 1991; Blundell et al., 2005; Cherchye et al., 2012), unpaid work (e.g. Chiappori, 1997; Bryant and Zick, 2006), and non-work activities. This latter includes a vast array of activity types that can be sub-divided into two categories: leisure (e.g. Johnson, 1966; Jara-D\u00edaz and Astroza, 2013) and tertiary activities - such as transport (e.g. Train and McFadden, 1978; Small, 1982; Jara-D\u00edaz and Ort\u00fazar, 1989; Jara-D\u00edaz, 1994), and sleep (e.g. Biddle and Hamermesh, 1990). Analyses of time as a whole encompass the studies that try to understand time allocation as a structural phenomenon; all or specific combinations of activities are analyzed (e.g. Becker, 1965; DeSerpa, 1971; Evans, 1972; Pollak and Wachter, 1975; Kitamura, 1984; Gronau, 1986; Bhat and Koppelman, 1999; Jara-D\u00edaz et al., 2008). This paper incorporates one of the most important conceptual contributions in time use research in the twentieth century: the acknowledgement of unpaid/domestic work as a distinctive area of research, linked but different from labor supply. This activity has been an important topic of discussion in areas such as official national accounts (quantifying the value added to current measurements), gender studies (distribution of domestic work between spouses) and the subjective valuation of domestic production output. Nevertheless, domestic production has not been properly incorporated in time use models, especially within those whose main purpose is to estimate different values of time, which usually fall within the unitary framework, i.e. those that treat the household as one decision unit. Though, there have been some efforts to acknowledge home economics as a source of improvement in the modeling and understanding of the value of time, both individual and social (Jara-Diaz, 2000). To our opinion, accounting for the value of domestic production, the value of domestic labor and the effect of the trade-off between work and non-work activities, such as leisure, should allow a better model formulation, and could improve the interpretation of the value of time. Most studies that analyze the use of external providers have had mostly descriptive and discussion-driven approaches, lacking a proper modeling framework (e.g. Romero, 1987, 1988a, 1988b; Cock, 1989; De Melo, 1998; Yeoh and Huang, 1998; Lan, 2003; Cortes and Tessada, 2007; Huang and Yeoh, 2007). In general, household members are assumed to take all these responsibilities. In reality, nonetheless, households may employ external providers to perform household domestic activities. If these household responsibilities are assumed by market agents, it is reasonable to believe that the activity patterns of some household members will change. Some studies have tried advancing in this area but with limited results. For example, Wang (2006) concluded that hiring an external provider diminishes the number of domestic activities performed by household heads. Wang and Li (2009) studied the households\u2019 decision of hiring domestic agents and their impact on household members\u2019 time allocation to daily activities. Their empirical model was used to predict for all households in a Hong Kong sample whether a domestic helper was hired or not. Their limitation, however, was the lack of an income constraint in their formulation, which prevents the emergence of time values. The microeconomic approach overcomes this limitation. There are other, non-microeconomic approaches to assign a value to household services. As stated by Ironmonger (2000), these can be summarized by three methods commonly used in the literature: the wage rate, looked at as the \u201copportunity cost\u201d of an extra hour of work in a market job rather than an hour of unpaid household work; the \u201cspecialist replacement cost\u201d, that uses the wages of specialist paid workers who come to the household (e.g., a cleaner, a cook, a nanny, a gardener), as the payment avoided when a household member performs those tasks; finally, the \u201cgeneralist replacement cost\u201d given by the wage rate for a generalist worker or housekeeper. As we will see in the next section, these \u201cvalues\u201d are in fact inputs in a general formulation from which a proper value of time assigned to domestic work can be obtained. In order to enrich the framework synthesized by Eqs. (6) to (10) we will reconsider some contributions and ideas from other fundamental papers: Reid's (1934) distinction between productive and unproductive activities will prove very useful for our purposes; we will borrow from Becker (1965) the notion of a domestic production function where final goods are looked at as functions of time and market goods; finally, from Pollak and Wachter (1975) we will take the recognition of the neglected role of domestic work at home within a Becker-like framework. In Becker's model of consumer behavior, a household purchases Xj units of market commodity j and combines it with a household input of time, Tj , to produce Zj = fj (Xj, Tj ) units of a finally demanded commodity Zj for j= 1,2,\u2026,N, where fj is the household production function for the nth finally demanded commodity. Some examples of such finally demanded \u201cproduced\u201d commodities are: \u2022 Cooking a meal: \u25cb Inputs: clean utensils, stove, ingredients, time required to make the meal. \u25cb Output: prepared meal. \u2022 Reading a book: \u25cb Inputs: physical or online book, time assigned to reading the book. \u25cb Output: book read. \u2022 Cleaning the house: \u25cb Inputs: cleaning utensils and time. \u25cb Output: clean house. \u2022 Childcare: \u25cb Inputs: diapers, games, food, time assigned to accompanying children. \u25cb Output: assisted children. Models of domestic production that follow Becker's line suggest the opportunity cost approach (wage rate) as the most appropriate valuation of this activity. However, Pollak and Wachter (1975) recognized some limitations of this analysis, namely the lack of an explicit acknowledgement of both household work at home and the direct (dis)utility of work. The model we propose will incorporate all activities engaged by the individual, differentiating between market work, domestic work and the rest of activities. We will modify Becker's use of commodities by following Reid's third-party rule (1934) and acknowledging two types of activities that produce finally demanded commodities: \u2022 Unproductive activities: Activities that cannot be performed by an external agent hired in the market without losing their intrinsic value, such as eating a meal or listening to music. \u2022 Productive activities: Activities that can be performed either by the individual or by an external agent hired in the market without losing their intrinsic value, such as cleaning the house or childcare. We will refer to this type of activity as domestic work . For synthesis, expansion of current time use models from which time values can be derived should benefit from the introduction of (i) explicit domestic production technical constraints and (ii) the substitution between the hours assigned by household members and by external providers to perform certain domestic activities. 3 A time use model including external agents in domestic production Let us first formulate a generic model where final domestic outputs (goods) Zd and their inputs \u2013 own and hired work (Td and Hd ) and intermediate market goods Yd \u2013 are explicitly introduced as follows: (13) M a x U ( T , X , Z ) (14) I + w T w \u2212 \u2211 d P d Y d \u2212 \u2211 j P j X j \u2212 \u2211 d s d H d \u2212 c f \u2265 0 (15) \u03c4 \u2212 T w \u2212 \u2211 d T d \u2212 \u2211 d T d 0 \u2212 \u2211 i T i = 0 (16) T i \u2212 T i m i n \u2265 0 \u2200 i (17) X j \u2212 X j m i n \u2265 0 \u2200 j (18) g ( Y d , T d , H d ) \u2212 Z d = 0 \u2200 d (19) h ( T d , H d ) \u2212 Y d = 0 \u2200 d In this model, an extension of the Jara-Diaz et al., (2008) framework, the individual can assign his time to three types of activities: remunerated work, Tw , with its wage rate, w; domestic work (productive activities), Td ; and other activities (unproductive activities), Ti . This last category has a subdivision: those activities that the individual assigns more time than the minimum required (leisure activities) and those that stick to their minimum (restricted activities). Note that we accept that there is a minimum time assigned by the individual to each domestic work, T d 0 . In terms of goods, the individual consumes final goods purchased at the market, Xj , at their respective price, Pj . These goods have a subdivision: those which consumption is greater than the minimum required (unrestricted goods), and goods that are consumed at their minimum (restricted goods). Furthermore, there is consumption of domestic goods, Zd , that are produced using the following inputs: intermediate market goods, Yd , at their price Pd ; time allocated by the individual, (Td + Td o ); and/or time assigned by a hired market agent, Hd , with a wage rate of sd . Also, the use of intermediate goods depends on the amount of domestic work, either own or hired. I is the income from other sources different than market work, and cf represents the total fixed expenditures, those that do not depend on the goods or services purchased in the period. As formulated, this generic model accounting for domestic production in the context of time use incorporates most of the desired elements justified in the previous section. From this viewpoint, it represents a step forward in the understanding of individual time allocation (and, presumably, its valuation), without departing towards a proper multi-individual household time allocation model; this limitation will have to be taken into account when selecting data for empirical estimation. Nevertheless, so far the formulation and estimation of the different values of time have only been permitted by unitary models. In order to make model (13)\u2013(19) operational, we need to provide analytical expressions for the generic utility and domestic production functions in Eqs. (13), (18) and (19) respectively. For utility (Eq. (21)), we will keep the Cobb-Douglas functional form with an interesting addition, namely the decomposition of own domestic work into discretionary, Td , and minimum mandatory, T d 0 . For the domestic production function representing the use of intermediate goods (Eq. (19)) we will use a linear form considering different skills between own and hired work, reflected by rates \u03c3 d and od , respectively: (20) Y d = \u03c3 d [ T d + T d 0 ] + o d H d By using Eq. (20) now the final domestic goods production function (Eq. (18)) is only dependent on domestic work. As skills will play (again) a role, by using a linear expression the resulting form is also linear (Eq. (26)) . 2 2 Linearity indeed facilitates the analytics and is enough to capture the impact of domestic technology, but this is certainly an area for further research. The final formulation with explicit functions is summarized in model (21) to (26).

In addition to the parameters \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03ba, \u03b7 (previously explained), \u03b3 d represents the change in utility arising from a gain in one unit of domestic good, which has to be equal to the marginal utility of Zd as obtained from the first order conditions (presented in Appendix A), i.e. (27) \u2202 U \u2202 Z d \u2212 \u03b3 d = 0 \u2200 d \u2208 D As shown in Appendix A, the value of time as a resource, or value of leisure can be obtained as: (28) \u03bc \u03bb = \u0398 \u03a6 ( w T w \u2212 E c \u2212 \u2211 d P d ( \u03c3 d [ T d + T d 0 ] + o d H d ) \u2212 \u2211 d s d H d ) ( \u03c4 \u2212 T w \u2212 \u2211 d T d \u2212 T c ) where \u0398 > 0 and \u03a6 > 0 are the summations of the positive exponents \u03b8 i and \u03b7 k over all unrestricted leisure activities and unrestricted goods, respectively; total committed expenses Ec is the sum over expenses in constrained goods minus fixed income I, and total committed time Tc is the sum of constrained activities. The value of leisure can be formulated in terms of the total value of work (Eq. (29)) and the total value of own domestic labor (Eq. (30)): (29) \u03bc \u03bb = \u2202 U / \u2202 T w \u03bb + w (30) \u03bc \u03bb = \u2202 U / \u2202 T d \u03bb + \u03f5 d \u03b3 d \u03bb \u2212 P d \u03c3 d Domestic goods can be produced with time allocated by the individual and/or the hired agent. Eq. (30) represents the individual equilibrium regarding his/her own domestic time. It establishes that the value of leisure should be equal to the total value of own domestic labor, which has three components: first, the money value of the marginal utility of a unit time at domestic labor by the individual (the value of assigning time to domestic work, (\u2202U/\u2202Td )/\u03bb, in DeSerpa's terminology); second, the money value of the marginal utility of the consumption of domestic goods (\u03b5 d \u03b3 d /\u03bb) produced by the individual; third, the money cost of the intermediate goods bought by the individual to utilize when assigning own domestic labor time, Pd \u03c3 d . By rearranging Eqs. (29) and (30), we obtain the following monetary equality, thus comparing productive activities and work: (31) \u2202 U / \u2202 T d \u03bb + \u03f5 d \u03b3 d \u03bb \u2212 P d \u03c3 d = \u2202 U / \u2202 T w \u03bb + w The left hand side of Eq. (31) represents the total value of domestic production given by the (dis)pleasure of working in domestic activities plus the money reward from enjoying the output of that work (domestic goods) minus the cost of the intermediate goods bought for the domestic goods produced. Therefore, Eq. (31) states that, at the margin, the individual will freely allocate his/her own time to domestic activities until the total value of domestic production equals the total value of remunerated work and the value of leisure by virtue of Eq. (29). Regarding hired time, first order conditions (Appendix A) indicate that for each domestic activity contracted: (32) \u2212 \u03bb s d \u2212 \u03bb P d o d + \u03b3 d \u03c8 d = 0 \u2200 d \u2208 D This can be rewritten as: (33) \u03c8 d \u03b3 d \u03bb = s d + P d o d Eq. (33) says that, when hiring external help (Hd > 0), the individual contracts labor until the value of the marginal product of hired work is equal to its marginal cost (wage sd plus the expenses in intermediate goods due to hired domestic labor time, Pdod ). Note that Eq. (31) can be rewritten using equivalence (33), showing explicitly that there is a ratio \u03b5 d /\u03c8 d that converts own domestic work ( T d + T d 0 ) into hired hours (Hd ) in the production of the domestic good (Zd ): (34) \u2202 U / \u2202 T d \u03bb + \u03f5 d \u03c8 d ( s d + P d o d ) \u2212 P d \u03c3 d = \u2202 U / \u2202 T w \u03bb + w Both Eqs. (31) and (34) can be interpreted out of the equilibrium condition. If the total value of work was larger (smaller) than the total value of own domestic labor, the individual would diminish (increase) time in domestic activities (increasing the value of the marginal utility), leaving it to hired domestic helpers, achieving equilibrium again. As advanced in Section 2, Eq. (34) shows unambiguously that the value of time assigned by the individual to domestic work, (\u2202U/\u2202Td )/\u03bb, receives the influence of the own wage rate and that of the external provider, but happens to differ from both. In the case of not hiring external help to perform any domestic activity (Hd =0 \u2200d) and considering intermediate goods (Yd \u2200d) and domestic activities ( T d + T d 0 \u2200 d ) as committed expenses and committed time respectively (as defined earlier), the value of leisure as expressed in Eq. (28) collapses into the value of leisure presented in Jara-D\u00edaz et al. (2008): (35) \u03bc \u03bb = \u0398 \u03a6 ( w T w \u2212 E c \u2212 \u2211 d P d ( \u03c3 d [ T d + T d 0 ] + o d H d ) \u2212 \u2211 d s d H d ) ( \u03c4 \u2212 T w \u2212 \u2211 d T d \u2212 T c ) = \u0398 \u03a6 * ( w T w \u2212 E c ) ( \u03c4 \u2212 T w \u2212 T c ) Let Af be the set of freely chosen activities, Ar the set of restricted activities, Gf the set of freely chosen market goods, Gr the set of restricted market goods, and D the set of domestic goods. Following the value of time derivation, and model estimation (first introduced by Jara-D\u00edaz et al., 2016), we can form a system of |Af |+|D|+|Gf |+1 equations with no closed solutions, as fully explained in Appendix A.

(36)\u2013(39) respectively arising from different independent sources, they can be assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution and the system can be estimated following the maximum likelihood procedure explained in Appendix A. 4 Data The information used for this analysis is obtained from the LISS panel data (Scherpenzeel and Das, 2010), a representative sample of Dutch individuals who participate in monthly (longitudinal) Internet surveys. The survey is reported annually with its first wave in 2008, covering a large variety of topics, with specific questionnaires also implemented, designed, requested and paid by researchers with the purpose of identifying specific behavioral conducts, trends, patterns or preferences. Here we will use the assembled survey on time use and consumption (Vermeulen, 2011; Vermeulen and Van Soest, 2011, 2013). This specific questionnaire was applied on three waves, conducted on 2009, 2010, and 2012. In this study we will analyze all waves. Respondents reported the time allocated to 13 activities during the past 7 days before the survey, and the average monthly expenditure (in euros) in 30 categories, considering the last year as reference. Socio-demographic information drawn from the LISS panel was used to complement the time use and consumption data. The pre-processing of the data follows a similar framework first proposed by Jara-Diaz et al., (2016). The 13 activities available in the original database were reduced to 11 by grouping three similar activities \u2013helping parents, helping family members, and helping non-family members\u2013into the single category of \u201cassisting friends and family\u201d: 1. Work: includes any type of paid work as an employee or as a self-employed worker. The reported time includes over hours. 2. Commute: travel to and from work. 3. Household chores: includes cleaning, shopping, cooking, gardening, etc. 4. Personal care: includes washing, dressing, eating, visiting the hairdresser, seeing the doctor, etc. 5. Education: includes day or evening courses, professional courses, language courses or other course types, doing homework, etc. 6. Activities with children: any activity with own children aged less than 16 years, such as washing, dressing, playing, taking child to doctor, taking child to school/hobby activities, etc. 7. Entertainment: includes in-home and out-of-home recreational activities, such as watching TV, reading, practicing sports, hobbies, computer as hobby, visiting family or friends, going out, walking the dog, cycling, sex, etc. 8. Assisting friends and family: assistance to friends and family members (not children). For example: helping with administrative chores, washing, dressing, seeing the doctor, voluntary work, babysitting, etc. 9. Administrative chores and family finances. 10. Sleeping and relaxing: includes sleeping, resting, thinking, meditating, being ill, etc. 11. Other activities: any activity not considered above. Model (21)\u2013(26) requires the amount of hired time for domestic work activities. In the sample, the only domestic activity with available information on external market providers was childcare (children's external daycare), a particularly interesting time assignment decision as acknowledged by Lloyd and Penn (2010), Middeldorp et al., (2014) and Villena-Rold\u00e1n and R\u00edos-Aguilar (2012), from various perspectives. The amount of hired time was calculated dividing the weekly expense on children's external daycare by the average hourly cost of external childcare in Netherlands that did not vary during the analyzed period (2009\u20132012), about 6.5 Euros in average according to several sources (Expatica, 2015; Expats Amsterdam, 2015; Passionate Parenting, 2015). The original number of individuals that completed the questionnaire for each wave was slightly larger than five thousand. As our purpose is to enrich the approach to capture time values properly in the direction of understanding the role played by domestic work (childcare), we have to consider that we have extended the unitary model framework, i.e. one where the household is treated as a black-box. From this viewpoint, single worker households allow assigning all personal and household expenditures to that individual worker, without entering the (very interesting indeed) area of decision making within the household (see Beblo, 2001). Accordingly, we selected those individuals who live in one-worker households (whose income coincides with that of the household), with at least one child living at home, who exhibited time allocated to activities with children, who worked at least an hour during the week and who reported expenditure in at least one of the expenditure categories. These are quite demanding conditions. To obtain the final estimation sample, in addition to the previous conditions different consistency checks were performed. As a first step, we focused on missing data, removing individuals who did not report important information such as income and/or time allocated to their week. Then, we checked temporal and budgetary constraints, removing respondents who reported more than 168h on their week and those whose total expenses were higher than their total income (ours is a static model which does not account for savings and investments). In terms of extremely high or low time allocated, we eliminated individuals whose average daily sleep time were lower than 4h, due to the suspicion that they may have underreported their weekly sleep time allocation and, therefore, misestimated their other activities; we removed individuals whose weekly duration of one activity was unfeasible (e.g. 168h per week in one activity). We also excluded respondents that, given their wage rate, would have to incur in expenditures higher than their income in order to hire external domestic help; as the minimum hourly wage in Netherlands for childcare was about 6.5 euros in the period, we left out individuals whose calculated wage rate was lower than 3 euros/hour (suspected to be in the informal labor market). After applying the conditions and the consistency checks the original sample got reduced to a little more than three hundred individuals observed in the three waves. Among these, there were three individuals that very likely misreported their weekly entertainment time, declaring zero; we suspected that this was reported as part of relaxing and we imputed the minimum weekly time compatible with feasible estimation, keeping the observations but distorting as little as possible the data. 3 3 These minutes were taken from \u201csleeping and relaxing\u201d, an unrestricted activity that every respondent allocated time to, with a minimum of 4.2 hours a day. A sensitivity analysis was performed to validate this procedure. For values of less than 20 minutes, the model could not be estimated. For values equal or greater than 20 minutes, the coefficients could be estimated and there was no substantial difference in the results for values between 20 minutes and 5 hours. After this selection process, the final estimation sample included 301 workers, 101 for the first wave, 86 for the second wave and 114 for the third one. To incorporate the novelty constraint in our model, we need the expenditure allocated to each activity purpose during the survey week. The LISS panel database contains detailed information about individual and household expenditures in 30 distinct categories not directly linked to the activities listed above. Consequently, the expenditure categories were studied in detail to assign each to the activity that best matched the description. In addition, we computed the fixed expenditures (cf ) as those expenditures not related with any activity purpose. Details about the association procedure and the definition of cf were performed following the framework first proposed by Jara-Diaz et al. (2016), and can be found in Appendix B. The database includes the worker's average gross and net income. For the analysis, only net income is considered, referred as income. It was disaggregated into salary (wTw ) and non-work income (I): salary is obtained from working time (for an employer or independently) and it is used to compute the wage rate w. Non-work income corresponds to the earnings received from pensions, investments, annuities, governmental support, scholarships, tax reimbursement and others non-work related sources drawn from another database in the LISS panel. To better estimate the model, it is necessary to classify the 10 non-work activities into the sets defined beforehand. This classification is presented in Table 1 . The set of activities restricted in expenses and time, therefore conforming the committed time (Tc ) and committed expenses (Ec ) items, comprises the following six activities: commute, household chores, personal care, education, assisting friends and family, and administrative chores and family finances. The set of unrestricted activities can be further divided into unproductive and productive activities (according to the classification previously proposed). Entertainment, sleeping and relaxing, and other, are considered unproductive (leisure activities), while childcare is the only productive (domestic work) activity that presents information on hired market agents according to the database used. This classification is based on the fact that, as mentioned in the previous section, the novelty of our proposed model is the introduction of the choice to hire external help to assist in the production of domestic goods, childcare in this case. The descriptive statistics of time use and expenditure for all individuals who actually participated in each activity are presented in Tables 2 \u2013 4 for each wave. By construction, all individuals allocate time to work and to sleeping and relaxing: on average, individuals work between 6.8 and 7.8h/day and sleep-relax between 7.8 and 8.2h/day. In addition, all workers spend time in personal care activities (recall that this activity type includes eating and dressing) and have high participation rates in activities with children (all workers live with at least one child at home but may not be the adult taking care of them). Commute, entertainment, and household chores present very high participation rates, while education presents the lowest one. Around 6% of the individuals actually choose to hire external help for childcare. Time allocated to work and hired childcare decreases from 2009 to 2010 and increases from 2010 to 2012. Time allocated to leisure and committed activities increase from 2009 to 2010 and decrease from 2010 to 2012. Regarding expenditures, personal care presents both the largest mean value and the largest participation rate, while education and hired childcare have the lowest participation rates. Note that our final sample is not meant to represent national averages. In fact, different sources show that Dutch individuals spend 30h/week in paid work in average, allocate around 56 weekly hours to sleep, between 35 and 42h to entertainment or other leisure activities, 10h to childcare and 7h to travel. Furthermore, the average gross hourly wage per person has increased from 20.07 to 21.71 EUR/hour from 2008 to 2012, roughly 14.05 to 15.2 net. Moreover, 75.8% of the population is employed (OECD, 2011; EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, 2012; Clo\u00efn, 2012; Statistics Netherlands, 2016). Finally, in Fig. 1 we show the average wage rate against time allocated to work for the three waves: representation in the left suggests that a lower wage leads to an increase in time at work, while the right side shows two possible scenarios to interpret our data assuming the usual backward bending labor supply curve. This is yet another issue to explore. 5 Results and analysis Given the information available, goods (expenses) Eq. (39) cannot be estimated when there is only one good in the set of unproductive unrestricted activities with unrestricted expenses (Entertainment). Consequently, there are four dependent variables in our system: time assigned to work (Tw ), time assigned to entertainment (Tentertainment ), time assigned to sleeping and relaxing (Tsleep ), and time assigned to domestic work, in this case childcare, (Tchildcare ). There are five utility parameters ( \u03b8 \u02dc w , \u03b8 \u02dc e n t e r t a i n m e n t , \u03b8 \u02dc s l e e p , \u03b8 \u02dc c h i l d c a r e and \u03a6 \u02dc ). Table 5 presents the model estimation results for the entire sample and the three separate waves. The upper section of the table presents the parameters of the model and the lower section displays the average values of time. The table shows that all parameters are statistically significant at a 95% level of confidence. Regarding values of time, both the mean value of leisure and the average value of work are positive for all samples, which means that workers considered in the analysis extract pleasure (at the margin) not only from leisure (as expected) but also from work in all waves (although negligible in the second). Furthermore, to test if the values of time are statistically different among waves, we calculated their confidence interval and conducted an independent t-test, shown in Table 6 . Results show that, unlike wave 2, the values of both leisure and work for wave 3 are not statistically different from wave 1 and from the total sample at a 95% level. Related with this, the value of leisure is significantly different from the wage rate for waves 1 and 3. Behind these different values of leisure and work many variables are involved, which makes the interpretation complicated. However, it stands that the second wave looks different in terms of perceptions - marginal value of work close to zero - and exhibiting a local reduction in the average number of hours worked. This behavior can be partially explained by the way the world economic crisis impacted the Netherlands in those years. As acknowledged in the literature, for different reasons the credit crisis reached the Netherlands by year 2010 although it had started in the United States in 2008 following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. According to Hagima (2013) the unemployment rate in the Netherlands increased from 3.8% in 2008 to 5.4% in 2010. After 2010, the economy began stabilizing, partially due to the fact that Netherlands had one of the lowest inflation rates in Europe even during the crisis (Hagima, 2013). According to CPB (2012a, 2012b) unemployment decreased in 2011 reaching 4% in 2012; thus, the slight recovery of economic growth following 2010 was not fully seen until the second half of 2012, with an economic growth largely due to exports, household consumption and business investments. The results shown in Table 5 can be analyzed from three different complementary angles: first, a comparison with a model that does not incorporate the choice of hiring external help; second, studying the evolution of individual behavior by performing a controlled test through the estimation of the new model considering only the group of workers that answered all three waves; third, an analysis of the context in which the individuals of our overall sample are immersed. Let us explore each of these angles. The new model was built from a base framework (Jara-D\u00edaz et al., 2008), which does not incorporate details regarding a specific activity nor the associated goods nor the relations between them. Unlike the new model, the base model requires the determination a priori of those activities and expenses that are committed, a limitation indeed. This requires, in this case, a decision regarding the classification of childcare as an activity, which generates two different scenarios: first, childcare treated as a committed activity with committed expenses; second, childcare regarded as an unrestricted activity with unrestricted expenses. In both scenarios, the cost of hiring external childcare has been classified as committed expenses. Results for the base model are presented in Tables 7 and 8 for the first and second scenario respectively. We computed the corresponding values of time following the activity classification previously presented when describing the data. Results show that the two base models overestimate the values of both leisure and work time. In other words, when omitting the possibility of hiring another person, the model cannot correctly capture the individual valuation of time. Furthermore, the first scenario, where childcare is considered a component of committed time and committed expenses, yields values of time that are almost 80% higher, on average, than the values of time for the second scenario, where childcare is considered an unrestricted activity. A possible explanation of the less inaccurate estimation of time values using the second scenario could be the fact that, as with the new model, childcare is considered an unrestricted activity with unrestricted expenses. The difference with the improved model, however, could be due to childcare being part of a new set of activities: productive ones. Let us move now to the second angle: the control test. Data showed that 21 individuals were present in all three waves, which suggested a controlled analysis in order to verify the possible influence of personal factors other than those captured by construction in the proposed model. We should note that this sub-sample of 21 individuals presents characteristics that differ from those observed in the sample used to estimate the models, regarding averages and/or dispersion of wages and time allocation across activities. Regarding wages, the sub-sample averages 19.1 Eur/h - larger than 15.1 Eur/h in the sample - increasing across waves from 14 to 25 Eur/ h. Regarding time assignment, the sub-sample allocated between 39 and 42h/week to paid work, around 5 weekly hours more than the observed in the sample in every wave. Committed time ranges between 40 and 43 weekly hours, always lower than the original sample (between 44 to 48h/week). Regarding other activities (sleep, entertainment, own childcare) and hired childcare, it stands out that the variance in the sub-sample is always larger than in the sample while the averages are similar except for hired childcare. The results of the control test on the new model are shown in Table 9 . On average, the values of leisure and work differ from the ones obtained when considering the entire sample (Table 5), but remain in the same order of magnitude. Finally, let us look at the results from the third proposed angle: the labor context. This can be done by addressing the pending question we posed at the end of Section 4: how to use our results to interpret our labor related data? As presented in Fig. 1 the relation between wage rate and working hours could be looked at through the eyes of the backward bending supply curve of labor theory, first presented by Robbins (1930). When the wage rate rises there are two effects: the monetary return from work increases and the opportunity cost of leisure rises accordingly; as a result, leisure becomes more expensive, leading people to substitute leisure for work (substitution effect) and the labor supplied increases with wage. Goods consumption and utility increase as well, but at a decreasing rate until a point where leisure (a normal good itself) becomes scarce (and valuable) enough to be traded for work as the wage rate continues increasing, inducing a reduction of labor supply (income effect). What is relevant here is to unveil the implicit values of time behind this reasoning: in the upper part of the curve, where the income effect dominates, individuals are willing to sacrifice labor time in favor of allocating more hours to non-paid time, suggesting a higher value of leisure than in the lower part of the curve, where the substitution effect is more powerful and individuals substitute leisure time in favor of labor with higher wages. What do our data and results tell us? The information synthesized in Table 10 includes what Fig. 1 shows, i.e. average wage rates and working time for the three waves, showing also the values of work and leisure obtained from our models, which is the new information that will be proved useful for our analysis. The two interpretations of what was going on in the labor market were summarized in Fig. 1 as a choice for the location of the point representing wave 1: below or above the point that separates the substitution from the income effect, taking into account that waves 2 and 3 would be located above that point, in the zone were the income effect dominates in both scenarios. If the point representing wave 1 was below, the associated value of leisure should be lower than for waves 2 and 3, which is not the case. If the point in question was above, where the income effect dominates, it would mean that the associated wage rate was in the upper zone within the economy, but in fact it is below the national average (roughly 14.5 Eur/h as shown in Section 4). We believe that the context could be given by an alternative approach. According to the textbook model, people with low wages would work more given an increase in their wage rate. In practice, the opposite is often observed not only in less industrialized countries but also in wealthier countries especially during economic downturns. Within the literature on labor supply, one can find theories that relate the wage rate and the hours of work under the conditions that prevail in our waves. One of these theories is presented and developed by Dessing (2002). She states that the canonical labor supply model of textbooks is, in fact, incomplete: it fails to capture the observed behavior of people with wages below an adequate (country-specific) level. Dessing's model presents a negative labor supply response at low-income levels, describing the behavior of individuals working with wages between a subsistence level and the area where wages are high enough to be explained by the classical backward-bending curve, arriving to what she calls an S-shaped labor supply curve. The fact that people in impoverished circumstances or just above a subsistence level work longer hours as wages fall in order to maintain or increase purchasing power - displaying negative labor supply elasticity - had been supported by authors like Chelintsev (1918), Boeke (1953), Berg (1961), Mellor (1963) and Myrdal (1971), among others. What would be the subsistence level in the Netherlands? According to Numbeo (2015) in its \u201cCost of Living in Netherlands\u201d analysis, there is a minimum wage of 8.4 Eur/h but he adds that the adequate average monthly disposable salary (almost constant since 2008) for an individual to satisfy basic needs should be 2241.85 euros, between 14.8 and 16.5 Eur/h depending on the assumed working hours. So a subsistence wage should be higher than the minimum, closer to the adequate. It is quite evident that the wage rate in our wave 1 is closer to that amount. In Fig. 2 we present our data within Dessing's framework. With this view, wage 1 represents a point where people work many hours at a low wage; as wages increase people increases leisure by working less but keeping the income level. In this adjustment the associated value of leisure diminishes. As wages increase further, people behave as in the traditional backward bending labor supply curve, working more and increasing the value of leisure. As a general conclusion from this third angle of analysis of the results, the values of leisure obtained with our model help explaining the behavior of individuals when looked at from the context of the labor market. 6 Synthesis, conclusions and further research We have developed a model explicitly introducing a piece that was missing in previous models of time use whose aim is to compute different values of time: hiring an external agent to perform activities for the individual without losing their intrinsic value, i.e. productive domestic activities. This indeed improves over the previous most advanced microeconomic formulations, generating a system of stochastic equations where the endogenous variables are work, domestic/productive activities, freely consumed market goods and those activities that are assigned more time than the minimum required. From this system, the parameters of the implicit equations can be estimated using maximum likelihood techniques without assuming independence of the error terms. The impact of this innovation on the value of leisure was examined theoretically first, showing that new effects had to be considered, namely the value of the individual's own domestic labor, the value of consumption of domestic goods, the cost of the necessary intermediate goods, the cost and time allocated by external domestic agents, and the skills of the individuals whose time was allocated to productive activities. We also showed that these new values of time collapse into the values obtained in previous works under the right assumptions: no external agent hired, intermediate goods and domestic activities considered as committed expenses and committed time respectively. Currently, the value of assigning time to perform domestic work has been assumed to be either the own wage rate (opportunity cost) or the wage rate of the external provider(s) (replacement costs). We have shown unambiguously that this individual time value is influenced by the two types of wage rate but happens to differ from both. Our microeconomic framework was applied to a sample extracted from three Dutch weekly time use and consumption databases (waves), one of the few surveys in the world that includes the information on time allocation, goods consumption and at least one productive activity that could be hired (childcare), necessary to estimate our model. The resulting values were analyzed from three perspectives: model comparison, a controlled experiment, and context. The new model yielded quite different (lower) values of leisure and work as compared with the base formulation, a model that required an a priori classification of every non-leisure activity as committed, which was shown to influence significantly the (over)estimated values of leisure and, moreover, yielded quite different results depending on the activity classification. The controlled experiment (same models restricted to the same individuals across waves) showed that other elements do not seem to influence results in this particular case. Finally, and regarding context, data and estimated leisure values were shown to be aligned with the labor supply theory proposed by Dessing (2002). For synthesis, incorporating domestic outputs, domestic work and the effect of the trade-off between own time and hired work yields a better estimation of the values of time and improves their interpretation. We believe that the analysis of a new category of activities (domestic) and the inclusion of external providers towards the production and consumption of domestic goods significantly enriches the properties of microeconomic models of consumers\u2019 time use. Further research can be pursued in two main directions: data and modeling issues. In terms of data issues, first, one should explore the dynamics of multi-worker households. This study was conducted with one-worker households as it allowed assigning all personal and household expenditures to the only worker without making assumptions regarding how the household expenditures are shared among income producers. The main purpose of this paper was to enrich the formulation of time use models currently estimating values of time and not to improve intra-family time allocation theories. Further research could focus on a two-breadwinner scenario and study the interaction between working spouses; a number of alternatives could be considered, ranging from bargaining models to cooperative and non-cooperative models (a comprehensive review can be found in Beblo, 2001). Second, multi-period decisions can also play an important role on time use modeling because of the endogenous and/or exogenous evolution of both time and money budgets; very likely the incorporation of the possibility of hiring different types of external agents makes sense in a multi-period framework. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that this study was conducted at an aggregated level and not for specific segments of the sample. It could be possible that the values of time can vary, for example, by gender and/or by age; however, given the small sample available, these potential differences across segments could not be studied. In terms of modeling issues, one should explore contributions from other fields and other forms of data treatment. Most of the time-use model estimation procedures are based on the overall allocation of time to specific activities and not on an episode-based framework, therefore overlooking the intrinsic value of performing activities in a precise sequence within the period analyzed. We believe that episode-based analysis is indeed a path to be explored. This could provide insight on the behavior of certain groups of individuals, on how specific activities and/or group of activities are being performed, and on the valuation of routines, patterns and repetitions. This type of modeling would require a detailed representation of numerous and quasi-unique alternatives (episode sequences). This level of detail would be impossible to implement in present modeling structures and results in the omission of certain attributes that needs to be overcome with the collection of more complete data. This occurs because of two reasons; one is related with data collection, as minute-by-minute observations are almost never achievable and people are not always willing to participate in the exhaustive recollection of their every move. The other reason is related with current limitations in computational and methodological tools, which interfere with the estimation of detailed-sequential models. Finally, the empirical component of the study conducted in this paper considered only childcare as a possibility for hire. However, the model proposed is general enough to consider any number of productive activities that can be outsourced, potentially improving estimation and interpretation of results.

Appendix A Model, values of time derivation and estimation procedure The proposed model formulated in Section 3 is: (A.1) M a x U = \u03a9 T w \u03b8 w \u220f i T i \u03b8 i \u220f d ( T d + T d 0 ) \u03b8 d \u220f j X j \u03c6 j \u220f d Z d \u03c6 d (A.2) I + w T w \u2212 \u2211 d P d ( \u03c3 d [ T d + T d 0 ] + o d H d ) \u2212 \u2211 j P j X j \u2212 \u2211 d s d H d \u2212 c f \u2265 0 \u2190 \u03bb (A.3) \u03c4 \u2212 T w \u2212 \u2211 d T d \u2212 \u2211 d T d 0 \u2212 \u2211 i T i = 0 \u2190 \u03bc (A.4) T i \u2212 T i m i n \u2265 0 \u2190 \u03ba i \u2200 i (A.5) X j \u2212 X j m i n \u2265 0 \u2190 \u03b7 j \u2200 j (A.6) ( \u03f5 d [ T d + T d 0 ] + \u03c8 d H d ) \u2212 Z d = 0 \u2190 \u03b3 d \u2200 d The first order conditions are: for remunerated work (A.7) \u03b8 w U T w + \u03bb w \u2212 \u03bc = 0 For each domestic work activity actually engaged by the individual (A.8) \u03b8 d U ( T d + T d 0 ) \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 \u03bb P d \u03c3 d + \u03b3 d \u03f5 d = 0 \u2200 d \u2208 D For each activity different tan remunerated work and domestic work (A.9) \u03b8 i U T i \u2212 \u03bc = 0 \u2200 i \u2208 A f (A.10) \u03b8 i U T i \u2212 \u03bc + \u03ba i = 0 \u2200 i \u2208 A r For market goods: (A.11) \u03c6 j U X j \u2212 \u03bb P j = 0 \u2200 j \u2208 G f (A.12) \u03c6 j U X j \u2212 \u03bb P j + \u03b7 j = 0 \u2200 j \u2208 G r For domestic goods actually consumed: (A.13) \u03c6 d U Z d \u2212 \u03b3 d = 0 \u2200 d \u2208 D For each domestic work activity contracted with the hired agent: (A.14) \u2212 \u03bb s d \u2212 \u03bb P d o d + \u03b3 d \u03c8 d = 0 \u2200 d \u2208 D First order conditions (A.9) plus constraints (A.3) and (A.4) from the model, for all activities in Af yield: (A.15) \u03bc U = \u0398 ( \u03c4 \u2212 T w \u2212 \u2211 d T d \u2212 \u2211 d T d 0 \u2212 \u2211 i \u2208 A r T i m i n ) First order conditions (A.11) plus constraints (A.2) and (A.5) from the model, for all goods in Gf yield: (A.16) \u03bb U = \u03a6 ( I + w T w \u2212 \u2211 j \u2208 G r P j X j m i n \u2212 \u2211 d P d ( \u03c3 d [ T d + T d 0 ] + o d H d ) \u2212 \u2211 d s d H d \u2212 c f ) \u0398 > 0 and \u03a6 > 0 are the summations of the positive exponents \u03b8 i and \u03b7 k over all unrestricted leisure activities and unrestricted goods, respectively. If committed time and committed expenses are defined as T c = ( \u2211 i \u2208 A r T i m i n + \u2211 d T d 0 ) and E c = ( \u2211 j \u2208 G r P j X j m i n + c f \u2212 I ) , then by diving equation (A.7) by U and replacing (A.15) and (A.16) we have: (A.17) \u03b8 w T w + w * \u03a6 ( w T w \u2212 E c \u2212 \u2211 d P d ( \u03c3 d [ T d + T d 0 ] + o d H d ) \u2212 \u2211 d s d H d ) \u2212 \u0398 ( \u03c4 \u2212 T w \u2212 \u2211 d T d \u2212 T c ) = 0 Combining equations (A.9) and (A.15): (A.18) \u03b8 i T i \u2212 \u0398 ( \u03c4 \u2212 T w \u2212 \u2211 d T d \u2212 T c ) = 0 \u2200 i \u2208 A f From equations (A.8), (A.15), (A.16) and replacing equation (A.13): (A.19) \u03b8 d ( T d + T d 0 ) \u2212 \u0398 ( \u03c4 \u2212 T w \u2212 \u2211 d T d \u2212 T c ) \u2212 P d \u03c3 d * \u03a6 ( w T w \u2212 E c \u2212 \u2211 d P d ( \u03c3 d [ T d + T d 0 ] + o d H d ) \u2212 \u2211 d s d H d ) + \u03c6 d \u03f5 d Z d = 0 \u2200 d \u2208 D From equations (A.14), (A.15) and replacing equation (A.13): (A.20) \u03c6 d \u03c8 d Z d \u2212 ( s d + P d o d ) \u03a6 ( w T w \u2212 E c \u2212 \u2211 d P d ( \u03c3 d [ T d + T d 0 ] + o d H d ) \u2212 \u2211 d s d H d ) = 0 \u2200 d \u2208 D It can be seen that equations (A.19) and (A.20) share the term \u03c6 d Z d . Therefore, both equations can be reduced to the following: (A.21) \u03b8 d ( T d + T d 0 ) + ( \u03f5 d \u03c8 d ( s d + P d o d ) \u2212 P d \u03c3 d ) \u03a6 ( w T w \u2212 E c \u2212 \u2211 d P d ( \u03c3 d [ T d + T d 0 ] + o d H d ) \u2212 \u2211 d s d H d ) \u2212 \u0398 ( \u03c4 \u2212 T w \u2212 \u2211 d T d \u2212 T c ) = 0 \u2200 d \u2208 D From equations (A.11) and (A.16): (A.22) \u03c6 j P j X j \u2212 \u03a6 ( w T w \u2212 E c \u2212 \u2211 d P d ( \u03c3 d [ T d + T d 0 ] + o d H d ) \u2212 \u2211 d s d H d ) = 0 \u2200 j \u2208 G f Equations (A.17), (A.18), (A.21) and (A.22) form a system of |Af |+|D|+|Gf |+1 equations. The decision variables are work time, time allocated to unconstrained activities, quantity of domestic goods produced, and the amount of unconstrained market goods bought and consumed. Once the system is solved, the value of time as a resource, or value of leisure can be obtained as: (A.23) \u03bc \u03bb = \u0398 \u03a6 ( w T w \u2212 E c \u2212 \u2211 d P d ( \u03c3 d [ T d + T d 0 ] + o d H d ) \u2212 \u2211 d s d H d ) ( \u03c4 \u2212 T w \u2212 \u2211 d T d \u2212 T c ) Similarly, the value of work can be formulated as: (A.24) \u2202 U / \u2202 T w \u03bb = \u03bc \u03bb \u2212 w Finally, we can also formulate the value of domestic labor. Dividing first order condition (A.8) by \u03bb we obtain: (A.25) \u2202 U / \u2202 T d \u03bb = \u03bc \u03bb \u2212 \u03f5 d \u03b3 d \u03bb + P d \u03c3 d Replacing equation (A.14) into (A.25) we have: (A.26) \u2202 U / \u2202 T d \u03bb = \u03bc \u03bb \u2212 \u03f5 d \u03c8 d ( s d + P d o d ) + P d \u03c3 d For the estimation of the model we will follow the maximum likelihood approach by Jara-D\u00edaz et al., (2016). Dividing equations (A.17), (A.18), (A.21) and (A.22) by \u0398 and adding stochastic error terms on each equation (uw , ui, vd, vj ), we obtain: (A.27) \u03b8 \u02dc w T w + w * \u03a6 \u02dc ( w T w \u2212 E c \u2212 \u2211 d P d ( \u03c3 d [ T d + T d 0 ] + o d H d ) \u2212 \u2211 d s d H d ) \u2212 1 ( \u03c4 \u2212 T w \u2212 \u2211 d T d \u2212 T c ) = u w (A.28) \u03b8 \u02dc i T i \u2212 1 ( \u03c4 \u2212 T w \u2212 \u2211 d T d \u2212 T c ) = u i \u2200 i \u2208 A f (A.29) \u03b8 \u02dc d ( T d + T d 0 ) + ( \u03f5 d \u03c8 d ( s d + P d o d ) \u2212 P d \u03c3 d ) \u03a6 \u02dc ( w T w \u2212 E c \u2212 \u2211 d P d ( \u03c3 d [ T d + T d 0 ] + o d H d ) \u2212 \u2211 d s d H d ) \u2212 1 ( \u03c4 \u2212 T w \u2212 \u2211 d T d \u2212 T c ) = v d \u2200 d \u2208 D (A.30) \u03c6 \u02dc j P j X j \u2212 \u03a6 \u02dc ( w T w \u2212 E c \u2212 \u2211 d P d ( \u03c3 d [ T d + T d 0 ] + o d H d ) \u2212 \u2211 d s d H d ) = v j \u2200 j \u2208 G f where \u03b8 \u02dc w = \u03b8 w \u0398 , \u03b8 \u02dc i = \u03b8 i \u0398 , \u03b8 \u02dc d = \u03b8 d \u0398 , \u03a6 \u02dc = \u03a6 \u0398 , \u03c6 \u02dc j = \u03c6 j \u0398 The terms Pd \u03c3 d and Pdod were directly computed from the data by dividing time by expenditure for the domestic activity. Note that only the terms Pd \u03c3 d and Pdod are needed to estimate equations (A.27), (A.29) and (A.30), and we do not require the value of Pd , \u03c3 d and od independently. Due to the presence of time and income budget constraints, only n \u22121 time assignment and goods consumption equations can be estimated, where n is the number of unconstrained activities and unconstrained goods. For convenience we define 3 new indexes l, b y m with: l =1 (paid work) l =2, 3, \u2026, L +1 (freely chosen activities corresponding to set Af; L its cardinality) m =1, 2, \u2026, M (freely chosen goods corresponding to set Gf; M its cardinality) b =1, 2, \u2026, B (domestic goods corresponding to set D; B its cardinality) The left hand side of equations (A.27)\u2013(A.30) is a function of time assigned to activities fw (Tw, Tl, Tb, Xm, Hb ), fl (Tw, Tl, Tb, Xm, Hb ), to bought and consumed market goods gm (Tw, Tl, Tb, Xm, Hb ) and to domestic goods produced hb (Tw, Tl, Tb, Xm, Hb ) Therefore, those equations can be summarized in: (A.31) f l ( T 1 , \u2026 , T L + 1 , T L + 2 , \u2026 , T L + B + 1 , X 1 , \u2026 , X M , H 1 , \u2026 , H B ) = u l l = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , L + 1 (A.32) g m ( T 1 , \u2026 , T L + 1 , T L + 2 , \u2026 , T L + B + 1 , X 1 , \u2026 , X M , H 1 , \u2026 , H B ) = u m m = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , M (A.33) h b ( T 1 , \u2026 , T L + 1 , T L + 2 , \u2026 , T L + B + 1 , X 1 , \u2026 , X M , H 1 , \u2026 , H B ) = u b b = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , B Therefore, vector u =(u 1, u 2, \u2026., u L +1, v 1, v 2, \u2026, v M + B )\u2032 is assumed to be a multivariate normal distribution realization, with u \u223c M V N L + M + B + 1 ( 0 , \u03a9 ) indicating a (L+M+B+ 1)-variate normal distribution with mean vector of 0 and covariance matrix \u03a9. As with the estimation procedure for the microeconomic model presented by Jara-D\u00edaz et al (2008), the errors can be assumed to be in a multivariate normal distribution because they arise from different independent sources. The probability distribution function of u is denoted by \u03d5 L + M + B + 1 * ( . ; 0 , \u03a9 ) . Consequently, the probability that the individual assigns T 1 to work, T 2, \u2026, T L +1 to activities in Af, T L +2, \u2026, T L + B +1 to domestic work activities, X 1, \u2026, XM to goods in Gf , and hires H 1, \u2026, HB external domestic help, corresponds to: (A.34) P ( T 1 , \u2026 , T L + 1 , T L + 2 , \u2026 , T L + B + 1 , X 1 , \u2026 , X M , H 1 , \u2026 , H B ) = | det ( J ) | \u03d5 L + M + B + 1 * ( f 1 , \u2026 , f L + 1 , g 1 , \u2026 , g M , h 1 , \u2026 , h B ) J is the Jacobian of the vector function F (T 1, \u2026, T L +1, T L +2, \u2026, T L + B +1, X 1, \u2026, XM, H 1, \u2026, HB )=(f 1, \u2026, f L +1, g 1, \u2026, gM, h 1, \u2026, hB )\u2032. With \u03c9 as the diagonal matrix of standard deviations \u03c9 r of \u03a9, and \u03c6 L + M + B +1(.; \u0394) as the multivariate standard normal probability distribution function of dimension L+M+B+ 1 and correlation matrix \u0394. Then, (A.35) P ( T 1 , \u2026 , T L + 1 , T L + 2 , \u2026 , T L + B + 1 , X 1 , \u2026 , X M , H 1 , \u2026 , H B ) = | det ( J ) | ( \u220f r = 1 L + M + B + 1 \u03c9 r ) \u2212 1 \u03d5 L + M + B + 1 ( \u03c9 \u2212 1 F ; \u03c9 \u2212 1 \u03a9 \u03c9 \u2212 1 ) This yields the likelihood function: (A.36) L ( \u03b8 \u02dc 1 , \u2026 , \u03b8 \u02dc L + 1 , \u03b8 \u02dc L + 2 , \u2026 , \u03b8 \u02dc L + B + 1 , \u03c6 \u02dc 1 , \u2026 , \u03c6 \u02dc M , \u03c6 \u02dc M + 1 , \u2026 , \u03c6 \u02dc M + B , \u03a9 \u00af ) = P ( T 1 , \u2026 , T L + 1 , T L + 2 , \u2026 , T L + B + 1 , X 1 , \u2026 , X M , H 1 , \u2026 , H B ) where \u03b8 \u02dc 1 = \u03b8 \u02dc w , and \u03a9 \u00af is a row vectorization of the upper diagonal elements of \u03a9. Due to the presence of identification issues, we need to fix one of the standards deviations of \u03a9 to 1. To ensure that the normalized utility parameters \u03b8 \u02dc 2 , \u2026 , \u03b8 \u02dc L + 1 , \u03b8 \u02dc L + 2 , \u2026 , \u03b8 \u02dc L + B + 1 , \u03c6 \u02dc 1 , \u2026 , \u03c6 \u02dc M , \u03c6 \u02dc M + 1 , \u2026 , \u03c6 \u02dc M + B are positive, we parameterize them as using an exponential function. - Computation of the elements of the Jacobian The elements of the Jacobian are given by: (A.37) J l h = \u2202 f l ( T 1 , \u2026 , T L + B + 1 ) \u2202 T h where function fl is defined in equation (A.27) for l =1 (work), in equation (A.28) for l =2, 3, \u2026, L +1 (activities in Af ), and (A.29) for l = L +2, \u2026, L + B +1 (activities in D). Let (A.38) C = [ 1 w T w \u2212 E e c \u2212 \u2211 d P d ( \u03c3 d [ T d + T d 0 ] + o d H d ) \u2212 \u2211 d s d H d ] 2 \u03a6 \u02dc (A.39) D = [ 1 \u03c4 \u2212 T w \u2212 \u2211 d T d \u2212 T e c ] 2 Then, the lhth element of the Jacobian is: (A.40) J 11 = \u2212 \u03b8 w T w \u2212 2 \u2212 w 2 C \u2212 D (A.41) J 1 h = { 0 f o r 2 \u2264 h \u2264 L + 1 w P d \u03c3 d C \u2212 D f o r l + 2 \u2264 h \u2264 L + B + 1 (A.42) J l 1 = { \u2212 w ( \u03f5 d \u03c8 d ( s d + P d o d ) \u2212 P d \u03c3 d ) C \u2212 D f o r 2 \u2264 l \u2264 L + 1 w C f o r l + 2 \u2264 l \u2264 L + B + 1 (A.43) J 1 h = { \u2212 \u03b8 i T i 2 q l h f o r 2 \u2264 l \u2264 L + 1 , a n d 2 \u2264 h \u2264 L + 1 \u2212 D f o r 2 \u2264 l \u2264 L + 1 , a n d L + 2 \u2264 h \u2264 L + B + 1 0 f o r L + 2 \u2264 l \u2264 L + B + 1 , a n d 2 \u2264 h \u2264 L + 1 \u2212 \u03b8 d ( T d + T d 0 ) 2 * q l h + ( \u03f5 d \u03c8 d ( s d + P d o d ) \u2212 P d \u03c3 d ) P d \u03c3 d C \u2212 D f o r L + 2 \u2264 l \u2264 L + B + 1 , a n d L + 2 \u2264 h \u2264 L + B + 1 Where qlh =1 if l = h and qlh =0 if l \u2260 h. The determinant of the Jacobian has no closed-form structure. Appendix B Association of expenditures to activities Activity Expenditure category considered Commute - Average weekly household expenditure transportation, multiplied by 0.36. Assumption: According to a recent study in the Netherlands, about 18% of all trips are trips to work (Bohte and K. Maat, 2009). Then, trips to and from work account for about 36% of all trips. Household chores - Average weekly household expenditure in cleaning the house or maintaining the garden, divided by the number of adults in the household. Assumption: all adults in the household equally participate in household chores. Personal care - Average weekly personal expenditure in eating at home. Assumption: Some respondents did not declare their expenditure in this category, but they reported the household expenditure in eating at home (for all household members). Then, for those respondents with missing data, this expenditure was computed as the household expenditure divided by the household size. The assumption is that all household members consume the same amount of food. This was validated by computing the proportion of personal expenditure in eating at home, compared to the total household expenditure which, in average, was consistent with this assumption; Average weekly personal expenditure in food and drinks outside the house; Average weekly personal expenditure in personal care products and services; Average weekly personal expenditure in medical care and health costs not covered by insurance. Education - Average weekly personal expenditure in (further) schooling. Activities with children - Expenditure per week for children living at home in: food and drinks outside the house, cigarettes and other tobacco products, clothing, personal care products and services, medical care and health costs not covered by insurance, leisure time expenditure, (further) schooling, donations and gifts, other expenditures. Assumption: all children-related expenditure is associated with the time spent with them. This is not necessarily true: a parent can buy food and drinks outside the house for the children, but not spend time while the children eat. Or he/she can purchase a movie ticket and do not go with the children to the cinema. However, the survey does not provide information that allows us to identify the relationship between expenditures and activities with children, and we decided to consider all expenditures related with children. Entertainment - Average weekly personal expenditure in leisure time expenditure; Average weekly household expenditure in daytrips and holidays with the whole family or part of the family. Assisting friends and family; Administrative chores and family finances; Sleeping and relaxing; Other activities - No expenditure. Finally, we constructed the fixed expenses cf considering the following average weekly household expenditure categories: mortgage and rent; general utilities and insurances; alimony and financial support for children not (or no longer) living at home; debts and loans; other household expenditure; transportation, multiplied by 0.64 (corresponds to the expenditure on transportation for other household members and non-work travel); eating at home, minus average weekly household expenditure in eating at home (corresponds to the expenditure in eating at-home for other household members).

However, there is an incipient development of an issue of great importance: the role and influence of external agents on individual time allocation and the recognition of unpaid/domestic work as a distinctive area of research. In this paper we introduce domestic production and the potential domestic work substitution by external providers in a time use model, improving its formulation and the interpretation of the values of time. We take into account the marginal utility of domestic activities, their cost - either if self-produced or hired - and the relation between the domestic output and domestic work hours considering the difference in skills between providers and household members. A stochastic system of equations is proposed and estimated using three Dutch time use and expenses data sets, from which the values of leisure and work are computed and analyzed. Comparative results show that a model with no consideration of hired domestic providers overestimates the values of leisure.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2017-06-30", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191261516304507", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Rosales-Salas, Jorge"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Jara-D\u00edaz, Sergio R."}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191261516304507"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261516304507"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0191-2615(16)30450-7", "prism:volume": "100", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier Ltd.", "dc:title": "A time allocation model considering external providers", "prism:copyright": "\u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
