Highlights \u2022 Alternative definitions for perfect FIFO are provided. \u2022 Equivalence between alternative definitions is rigorously proved. \u2022 Requirements from solution representation for FIFO verification are given. \u2022 Challenges in meeting perfect FIFO are identified. Abstract Dynamic models of traffic require answers for many issues. One of them is the way priorities of different traffic streams (commodities) are managed. This is particularly challenging when flows are treated as continuous. It is common to consider the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) rule as a baseline for setting priorities; but most practical continuous flow dynamic models do not satisfy FIFO perfectly. This paper examines the difficulties associated with full adherence to network-wide FIFO. We examine six different ways to represent dynamic flow solutions over a network, and for each representation we discuss whether it is sufficient for verifying FIFO, whether the verification process is finite, and whether proving FIFO can be directly implied. Throughout the evaluation eight alternative definitions of FIFO are considered, seven of them are shown to be essentially equivalent, while the last definition is not, and may therefore be considered as \u201cweak\u201d FIFO. The most promising representation appears to be the one denoted as \u201ccohort bundles,\u201d while somewhat more abstract than the other representations, supporting this representation directly shows perfect FIFO satisfaction. Further evaluation of this representation remains a subject for future research. In a nutshell, the key conclusion of this analysis is that in order to satisfy perfect network-wide FIFO the number of discretized elements of flow should probably be allowed to grow quickly and unboundedly with model duration, and it cannot be determined a-priori. These insights about the challenges of incorporating FIFO in continuous flow dynamic models, which may be relevant also for other behavior-based priority rules, can help modelers and practitioners set realistic expectations regarding the level of control over priority rules that can be achieved within finite-dimensional continuous flow dynamic models. Keywords Dynamic network loading First-in-first-out Continuous flow 1 Introduction Continuous flow dynamic network loading (DNL) models have been studied extensively in recent decades, and proved useful in many practical applications. Popular examples are the cell transmission model \u2013 CTM (Daganzo, 1994) and the link transmission model \u2013 LTM (Yperman et al., 2006). In these models the propagation of traffic through nodes (from cell to cell or from link to link) is depicted by continuous variables representing the amount of traffic crossing the node within discrete time steps. DNL variants differ in several main aspects: grid discretization vs. grid-free methods; link model; node model or intersection representation (merges, diverges, as well as signalized and unsignalized intersections); aggregation/disaggregation of flow into commodities, e.g. by origin/destination/route; and priority rules governing the management (or book-keeping) of commodities by priorities at the link and node levels. This study focuses on the last aspect, namely how priorities of commodities are managed. In many previous studies, as early as Carey (1986) and Smith (1993), flow propagation priority rules aimed to satisfy the first-in-first-out (FIFO) condition. When time and space are considered as continuous, conditions of perfect network-wide FIFO can be formulated (e.g. Friesz et al., 1993; Friesz et al., 2013). Practical numerical solutions must have a finite-dimensional representation, i.e. some form of discretization. 1 1 The term discretization is used here as in Finite Element Analysis (e.g. Johnson, 1987) to imply any strategy for identifying a mesh, i.e. a finite set of points in the time-space domain, which is used as a basis for choosing a finite-dimensional subset from the infinite-dimensional solution space of continuous functions. The mesh points need not be regular, and they need not be predetermined. Discretization may lead to approximation, but in some cases it can support exact solutions as well. One of the most elaborate schemes for handling network-wide FIFO in finite-dimensional solutions is by consideration of history lists (Smith, 1993). The scope of this paper is exploring the range of solution representations between the two options: fully continuous and history lists. Formal expositions of these two solution representations are given in Sections 3 and 8 respectively, and for the other representations in Sections 4\u20137. History lists may seem to be as far as one would wish to go in an effort to satisfy FIFO. However, as we shall see, history lists are not sufficient for perfect FIFO verification. To the best of our knowledge, with a few exceptions (e.g. Smith, 1993), most finite-dimensional continuous-flow DNL models with route departure rate inputs address FIFO only within links, at various levels of precision or approximation. Therefore, these models are further away from perfect network-wide FIFO than solutions with history list representations. Clearly many of these models are very useful and have important value in dealing with the complexity of dynamic traffic networks, despite their deviation from FIFO. Future research stemming from the present paper may enable producing perfect FIFO solutions, at least for specific cases. Such solutions could be used to evaluate the magnitude of the deviations from FIFO in alternative approximate models, and to explore the practical implications of these deviations on model usefulness. A few previous studies examined part of the difficulties associated with implementing FIFO. One study illustrated how commonly used methods in CTM may lead to FIFO deviations (Blumberg and Bar Gera, 2009). A subsequent study (Carey et al., 2014) explored several levels of FIFO approximation, demonstrated why perfect FIFO cannot be ensured by any of them, thus further illustrating the difficulty of dealing with the FIFO condition. It is well known that in real traffic adherence to FIFO is not perfect. Some may argue that if our models deviate from FIFO and reality deviates from FIFO then there is no problem. However, there is no a-priori reason to assume that the deviations from FIFO in models (stemming from computational reasons) should bear resemblance to the deviations from FIFO in real traffic (stemming from driver behavior). In addition, there is no reason to assume that alternative priority rules will be easier than FIFO to implement computationally, especially if such rules will be derived from quantitative empirical evidence to reflect actual traffic behavior. It seems reasonable to expect that modelers should have control over the priority rule in their model. In particular, modelers may expect the freedom to choose whether FIFO will be satisfied strictly, or whether to deviate from FIFO. In the latter case modelers may wish to specify the nature and the magnitude of the deviations from FIFO they wish to introduce. This is why we believe that better understanding of the FIFO challenges is important, a goal we hope to partially address in this paper. To achieve this goal, two approaches can be considered: (1) a constructive practical approach focusing on what needs to be done during the computation of, e.g., a CTM solution; and (2) a formalistic approach focusing on definitions of mathematical conditions that can be used to verify perfect FIFO, and particularly what are the requirements from the way the solution is described in order to ensure perfect FIFO. A constructive approach will be developed in a separate article. The focus of this article is the second approach. By FIFO verification, in this paper, we are concerned with what numerical tests or checks would need to be undertaken (explicitly or implicitly) to determine whether a given DNL solution does, or does not, fully satisfy FIFO. In some cases this could mean checking the solution at every point in time and space. In other cases, it may be sufficient to check the solution at a finite number of points, e.g. if we can assume linearity of time-space trajectories between these discrete points. Note that the DNL solutions are taken as given, already constructed, hence we are not concerned here with methods used to construct DNL solutions. Also, this paper is not concerned with taking individual DNL models or methods and proving whether they do, or do not, always fully satisfy FIFO. The perspective taken in this paper is not a standard one. It can be viewed as a thought experiment involving an interface between two participants: one participant is the solution proponent, and the other is the FIFO verifier. The FIFO verifier asks the solution proponent to compute various values, and based on these values she tries to identify FIFO violations, or to determine that the solution satisfies network-wide FIFO perfectly. For example, the FIFO verifier may ask: \u201cWhat is the cumulative volume at time t = 37 s in the position x = 591 m along link 22\u02ee. The proponent will need to provide a value, say 932.534. The verifier is allowed to submit many queries, and to choose new queries based on the responses to previous queries. The proponent cannot take back any previous answers, and must respond to each query independently of any prior queries. It is typical in the literature to focus on the job of the solution proponent. This paper focuses on the job of the FIFO verifier. We consider six possible solution representations, and eight alternative definitions of FIFO. The exact structure of each representation is discussed in detail in subsequent sections, 2 2 Several additional terms have very specific meaning in this paper, particularly: (atomic) cohort; (atomic) bundle; time step; (atomic) time interval; overlap (full or partial); and (complete) priority. The interpretations of these terms are given in the appropriate places in the text, marked clearly as definitions. These terms are also used briefly and less formally in the introduction section, prior to their formal definitions. their acronyms and certain basic properties are presented here, in Table 1 , as an overview for the overall direction of the paper. The order of the representations is roughly from the most detailed to the most abstract, thus one can move from each row to the next by omitting various aspects of the traffic patterns, while interpretation rules can enable going in the opposite direction (up in the table) by filling the missing details. It is important to note that the solution representations in Table 1 should not be viewed as a categorization of existing DNL methods (e.g. CTM, LTM, etc.), but rather as a description of the agreement between the solution proponent and the FIFO verifier about the type of questions that can be asked. In principle, any DNL method can be used as a basis for supporting any solution representation. This will be illustrated in further detail in subsequent sections. Supporting solution representations with higher levels of abstractness (as indicated in Table 1) may be associated with increased conceptual effort, presumably imposed upon the solution proponent. A key motivation of DNL method developers to make that effort is the implication on proving perfect FIFO, as indicated in the last column of Table 1. If cohort-bundles are supported, the proof is a direct conclusion from the structure proposed hereon. If only CSCP or DSCP representations are supported, substantial additional effort may be needed for proving perfect FIFO. Another motivation is that the insights from the various representations can provide guidelines for the design of constructive methods that satisfy network-wide FIFO perfectly. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Preliminaries are presented in Section 2. Representations based on continuous space cumulative volume profiles (CSCP) and discrete space cumulative volume profiles (DSCP) are discussed in Section 3. CSCP is equivalent to the continuous-time continuous-space formulations of Friesz et al. (1993) and Friesz et al. (2013). Cohorts, also known as traffic packets (e.g. Smith, 1993), with continuous node crossing times (CCTC) are the topic of Section 4, while Section 5 deals with complete-priority-cohorts (CPC) solutions. In Sections 4 and 5 we assume that for every pair of cohorts sharing a link/cell, either one cohort has full priority over the other or both are fully overlapping. This is referred to as cohort-breakpoint-compatibility (CBC). By demonstrating that CBC holds, a solution proponent directly obtains a proof that perfect network-wide FIFO is satisfied. However, we show in Section 6 that satisfying CBC may require intractable (or even infinite) number of cohorts. Proving FIFO using CCTC or CPC representations is therefore possible in some cases, but not necessarily in all cases. Section 7 explores the option of cohort bundles (CB), where several cohorts are initially grouped together, and gradually split as needed. A novel formulation is presented to express the information structure needed for managing this solution representation. Cohort bundles can be viewed as a generalization of CPC. We show that CB is indeed sufficient for perfect FIFO verification. CB solutions address the situation discussed in Section 6 as leading to infinite number of cohorts. If a solution supports CB, this fact by itself directly proves that perfect network-wide FIFO must hold. This major benefit justifies, in our opinion, the conceptual burden some readers may incur while dealing with the abstract nature of this representation. Further evaluation of the tractability of CB solutions will be explored in a separate paper. In Section 8 we examine a solution representation by time-step-history-cohorts (TSHC), closely related to the ideas of Smith (1993). Intuitively such solution representation may seem sufficient for FIFO verification, while ensuring reasonable tractability, and particularly finite dimensions. We show that in such representation partially overlapping cohorts must be allowed. Some of the resulting problems are discussed, mainly via illustrative examples. In particular we show why the natural way to define FIFO for TSHC solutions, namely definition #8, is not equivalent to the other definitions for perfect FIFO. A summary concludes the paper in Section 9. 2 Preliminaries When flows are considered as continuous, it is useful to declare which flows are distinguishable and which are exchangeable. An important element in all dynamic network loading models is the way traffic progress through diverge nodes. This can be done in two main ways: (i) assuming that turning proportions (by time) are given exogenously, implying in a sense that all traffic elements are exchangeable (i.e. a single-commodity model); or (ii) distinguishing traffic by commodities, i.e. by their destination, or by their route. If all traffic elements are exchangeable then the definitions of FIFO discussed in this paper loose almost all of their meaning. As for the distinction by destination or by route, we follow the latter option for several reasons: (a) route implies destination, but not the other way around; (b) the focus of this paper is conceptual, rather than computational, therefore memory requirements and computation times are not a primary concern; (c) the exposition and the notation are easier to manage if the distinction is by route, rather than by destination; and (d) some route choice models consider attributes of the entire route (like toll), thus the choice of travelers in the same link/cell travelling to the same destination is not necessarily independent of their origin or their prior routing decisions. Some models distinguish travelers on the same route by additional attributes such as vehicle type, value of time, etc. If these distinguishing attributes are discrete, this amounts to identifying a set of classes of travelers. Adding classes to the notation used here is slightly more cumbersome, but otherwise does not cause any fundamental difficulties. Therefore, we will assume here that all travelers are in a single class. (Few studies examined continuous attributes of continuous flows. Such models are beyond the scope of the present paper.) In a single-class model, the only remaining attribute that can distinguish traffic along the same route is their departure time. Since single class traffic on a single route is treated as homogeneous and exchangeable then, so long as the traffic adheres to DNL rules of conservation etc., we can assume that the traffic exiting at any time is the traffic that entered first, so that it exits in FIFO order. Therefore, whenever a distinction by departure time is needed it can be implied inherently from any given solution. The remainder of this section introduces the basic notation used in this paper. Additional terms and notations are introduced as needed throughout the paper. For the readers\u2019 convenience all terms and notations are listed in the Appendix. Several key concepts used in this paper are fairly widely known from the literature on dynamic traffic models, such as cumulative volumes, arrival time functions, and so on. Detailed exposition of background material on these concepts is available in numerous resources (e.g. Daganzo, 1997). For the sake of self-consistency, these concepts are presented together with the notations used in this paper. Connections to previous usage of concepts are made when it is beneficial to the discussion. The topology of the network is described by a set of nodes, N, a set of links (or cells), A, and a set of points along all links, X. For every link a \u2208 A the tail and head nodes are denoted at and ah respectively, i.e. a =[at, ah ]. A segment is a set of consecutive links (or cells). The set of origins is P\u2282N, and the set of destinations is Q\u2282N. A segment that goes from an origin to a destination is considered as a route, and the set of all routes is denoted by R. The notation s 1\u2282s 2 means that segment s 1 is part of segment s 2. In particular, s\u2282r means that segment s is part of route r. The model covers a time range, [0, tmax ]. Part of the input to the DNL model is the route flow on every route r \u2208 R for every point in time t \u2208 [0, tmax ], denoted by hr (t). The cumulative route departure volume during an interval [t 1, t 2] is denoted by d r ( t 1 , t 2 ) = \u222b t 1 t 2 h r ( t ) . Obviously, the overall cumulative departure volumes dr (0, t), for all t \u2208 [0, tmax ], contains equivalent information to that of route flows. The maximal cumulative volume on each route is gr = dr (0, tmax ). A preliminary (not perfectly formal) definition of FIFO can be given with reference to infinitesimal amounts of traffic, assuming that the arrival time of each such infinitesimal amount of traffic, denoted for example by \u03b4, to every point x \u2208 X, can be identified by tx (\u03b4). FIFO definition #1 FIFO is fully satisfied if for every two infinitesimal amounts of traffic, \u03b41 and \u03b42, travelling along the same segment s, and for every two points x 1, x 2 \u2208 X within s, (1) t x 1 ( \u03b4 1 ) < t x 1 ( \u03b4 2 ) \u21d2 t x 2 ( \u03b4 1 ) < t x 2 ( \u03b4 2 ) . In addition to FIFO the solution representation should also support all other elements of the underlying DNL model, such as link-to-link (or cell-to-cell) total flow propagation rules, intersection behavior rules, etc. Again, the ability of the representation to support the DNL model can be shown constructively, by presenting a computation algorithm, or it can be shown conceptually, by a solution verification method. We follow the latter, as it permits generalization to many DNL models regardless of their details. In many cases it is enough for the DNL verification method to know the cumulative volume by route at every node of the network at a set of predetermined discrete time points. The structure of the predetermined set of time points is of little importance for our analysis, so for the sake of convenience of the discussion we will assume that these time points are spaced regularly, and denote the gaps between consecutive time points as \u201cthe\u201d time step, which is assumed to be unique for the entire model. In many variants of the CTM and the LTM, the equations needed to verify if the solution is correct, in terms of the fundamental diagram and in terms of merge behavior, indeed rely on such description of cumulative volumes by route at regular time steps. Therefore, when DNL verification is discussed, we shall assume that information on such regularly discretized grid is sufficient. Grid-free DNL methods (e.g. Henn, 2003; Mazar\u00e9 et al., 2011; Raadsen et al., 2016) require off-grid verification information. We believe that the main results of this paper remain valid when grid-free methods are used, but to simplify the exposition we focus on grid-verification of DNL conditions. 3 Cumulative-volume profile solutions The first type of solution representations we consider is by continuous-time cumulative-volume profiles (CP). For a given route, r \u2208 R, and a given point in the network, x \u2208 X, the cumulative volume profile V(r, x, t) is a continuous monotonically non-decreasing function of time t \u2208 [0, tmax ], representing the total amount of traffic along route r that passed point x by time t. Equivalent solution representations are used in various continuous-time continuous-space formulations (e.g. Friesz et al., 1993, Friesz et al., 2013). In principle the arrival time function, i.e. the time associated with the arrival of cumulative-volume v along route r to point x, is the inverse of the cumulative-volume profile. But since the cumulative-profile can remain constant during certain intervals, a single cumulative-volume value may be associated with a range of times. Therefore, we define two arrival time functions. The first is associated with the lower end of the range: (2) T ( r , x , v ) = inf ( t \u2208 [ 0 , t m a x ] : V ( r , x , t ) \u2265 v ) The second is associated with the upper end of the range: (3) T U ( r , x , v ) = { inf ( t \u2208 [ 0 , t m a x ] : V ( r , x , t ) > v ) v < g r t m a x v = g r These will be referred to as \u201clower\u201d (or regular) and \u201cupper\u201d arrival time respectively. Both functions are strictly increasing monotonically, but could be discontinuous. The difference between the two definitions can be seen at the boundaries, as 0= T(r, x, 0) \u2264 TU (r, x, v), and T(r, x, gr ) \u2264 TU (r, x, gr )=tmax. Inequalities occur if the flow on the route stops before the end of the modeling period (a very likely situation), or if it does not start at time t =0 (also a plausible situation). Differences between the two definitions also occur at any point of discontinuity. We shall use both definitions, as needed. Note that V(r, x, T(r, x, v))= V(r, x, TU (r, x, v))=v always, for any value v \u2208 [0, gr ], but T(r, x, V(r, x, t)) \u2264 t, with inequality possible if there is zero flow in an interval prior to t, where the function T is discontinuous, and similarly TU (r, x, V(r, x, t)) \u2265 t with inequality possible if there is zero flow in an interval right after t. CP solutions have two subtypes, in the first type space is also considered continuously, thus a CP is associated with every point in the network, x \u2208 X, creating a continuous space cumulative-volume profile (CSCP) solution. The other subtype is the discrete space cumulative-volume profile solution (DSCP), where CP's are defined only at nodes. Clearly both representations are sufficient for grid-verification of DNL conditions, excluding FIFO. CSCP is also sufficient for verification of any grid-free DNL scheme, while in some cases DSCP may be sufficient as well. Some readers may wonder at this point which of the known DNL methods should be considered in this context as continuous in space, and which should be considered as discrete in space. For example, consider LTM. One of the advantages of LTM is that computations are performed only at nodes, while mid-link values can be computed (if needed) in post-process. Is LTM continuous in space or discrete in space? For the purposes of this paper we assume that it all depends on the agreement between the solution proponent and the FIFO verifier. If the agreement allows questions only about nodes, or stated differently, if the solution proponent only provides cumulative-volume profiles for nodes, then we are dealing with DSCP. If questions about mid-link values are also allowed, or in other words, if the solution proponent provides a post-processing tool for computing cumulative volumes at all points in space, then we are dealing with a CSCP. This is one illustration how the same DNL method can support various solution representations. We start with the FIFO analysis for CSCP solutions. The FIFO assumption within each route implies that for every value of v the set of arrival times obtained by T(r, x, v) for all x along r represents a trajectory, and should be associated with the same infinitesimal amount of flow. In that sense, within route FIFO is inherently implied by this natural interpretation of CSCP solutions. Therefore, FIFO needs to be verified only between routes, and only if they share a segment. FIFO definition #2 A CSCP solution fully satisfies FIFO if and only if for every pair of routes r 1, r 2 sharing segment s, every two points x 1, x 2 \u2208 X within s, and every two cumulative volume values v 1 \u2208 [ 0 , g r 1 ] , v 2 \u2208 [ 0 , g r 2 ] the following condition always holds: (4) T ( r 1 , x 1 , v 1 ) < T ( r 2 , x 1 , v 2 ) \u21d2 T ( r 1 , x 2 , v 1 ) < T ( r 2 , x 2 , v 2 ) . The connection of definition #2 and definition #1 for perfect FIFO is fairly straight forward. Definition #2 is in fact more formal, and therefore we consider this as the primary definition of perfect FIFO. Any other solution representation will be considered sufficient for FIFO verification if it can be associated with a CSCP interpretation that satisfies FIFO definition #2. Such alternative representations are needed, since FIFO definition #2, as stated, consists of an infinite number of requirements. More importantly, proving perfect FIFO for a solution that supports CSCP representation may not be trivial at all. A CSCP representation is in most cases superfluous. Both CTM and LTM describe flows only at nodes (in the case of LTM all nodes are real, while in CTM there are additional artificial discretization nodes). Within such solutions we may have a continuous cumulative-volume profile by route at each node, thus obtaining a DSCP solution. The next question is therefore whether a DSCP solution can be sufficient for FIFO verification, and if so under what conditions. 3 3 For the purposes of the discussion in this section it does not matter if the DSCP has a finite dimensional representation or not. FIFO definition #3 A DSCP solution fully satisfies FIFO if for every pair of routes r 1, r 2 sharing segment s, every two nodes n 1, n 2 \u2208 s, and every two cumulative volume values v 1 \u2208 [ 0 , g r 1 ] , v 2 \u2208 [ 0 , g r 2 ] the following condition always holds: (5) T ( r 1 , n 1 , v 1 ) < T ( r 2 , n 1 , v 2 ) \u21d2 T ( r 1 , n 2 , v 1 ) < T ( r 2 , n 2 , v 2 ) . One way to show that a DSCP solution is sufficient for FIFO evaluation is by providing an interpretation/conversion scheme from DSCP to CSCP. This can be done in many different ways. As long as the interpolation rule is implemented consistently across routes for any given link-trajectory, FIFO definitions #2 and #3 will be equivalent. In that respect, maintaining within link FIFO is much simpler than maintaining network-wide FIFO. The choice of interpolation rule is not our focus here. Our concern is whether there exists at least one CSCP solution that satisfies FIFO definition #2 which can be associated with any given DSCP solution that stratifies FIFO definition #3. In particular, there may be solutions that satisfy FIFO perfectly, while satisfying other DNL conditions only approximately, e.g. at predetermined grid points; we wish to propose a vocabulary that enables identifying such solutions for what they are, namely perfect in terms of FIFO and approximate in other respects. This approach regarding interpolation is followed throughout the paper. In view of our goal, we choose the simplest possible interpolation scheme, i.e. linear interpolation, which could be applied either to the cumulative volume profiles or to the arrival time functions. The latter seems preferable for several reasons including: easier FIFO demonstration; identical range of the argument (v) at all nodes; and avoiding instantaneous flow propagation. Formally, if point x \u2208 X is on link a, and its distance from at relative to the link length is \u03b1, then the interpretation would be (6) T ( r 1 , x , v 1 ) = ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) \u00b7 T ( r 1 , a t , v 1 ) + \u03b1 \u00b7 T ( r 1 , a h , v 1 ) Proposition 1 A DSCP solution satisfies FIFO definition #3 if and only if its CSCP interpretation by (6) satisfies FIFO definition #2. Proof FIFO definition #2 for the CSCP interpretation includes the conditions of FIFO definition #3, therefore the \u201cif\u201d direction is obvious. It remains to show the \u201conly if\u201d. So suppose that the DSCP solution satisfies FIFO definition #3 (i.e. at all nodes), we need to show that its CSCP interpretation satisfies FIFO definition #2. Suppose that the point x 1 is on link a 1, and similarly point x 2 is on link a 2. Suppose T(r 1, x 1, v 1) < T(r 2, x 1, v 2) then by (6) either T(r 1, a 1t , v 1) < T(r 2, a 1t , v 2) or T(r 1, a 1h , v 1) < T(r 2, a 1h , v 2), but by (5) if T(r 1, a 1t , v 1) < T(r 2, a 1t , v 2) then T(r 1, a 1h , v 1) < T(r 2, a 1h , v 2) and vice versa. Hence both T(r 1, a 1t , v 1) < T(r 2, a 1t , v 2) and T(r 1, a 1h , v 1) < T(r 2, a 1h , v 2). Invoking (5) we get that T(r 1, a 2t , v 1) < T(r 2, a 2t , v 2) and T(r 1, a 2h , v 1) < T(r 2, a 2h , v 2). As a result, by (6), T(r 1, x 2, v 1) < T(r 2, x 2, v 2). \u25a0 Using FIFO definition #3 for verification purposes (while slightly better than FIFO definition #2) involves several complications: (a) due to time-continuity cumulative volumes have infinite possible values for v 1 \u2208 [ 0 , g r 1 ] and for v 2 \u2208 [ 0 , g r 2 ] ; (b) for any cumulative value on one of the routes the inequality condition requires considering all possible cumulative volume values on the other route; and (c) the condition needs to be checked for every triplet of two overlapping routes and each segment they share. The first issue will be treated in the next section, when cohorts are discussed. The other two issues are addressed here by an alternative (yet equivalent) definition of FIFO, in which the verification is done by equality condition (instead of inequality), and each route is considered relative to the links it contains, regardless of any \u201ccompeting\u201d routes. The modified FIFO definition uses link level cumulative volumes given by: (7) V ( a , x , t ) = \u2211 r \u2208 R : a \u2282 r V ( r , x , t ) . Their inverse arrival time functions are determined as in (2) and (3), only applied to links instead of routes. In addition, we shall also use the notation ga = V(a, x, tmax ) for the total link volume. FIFO definition #4 A DSCP solution fully satisfies FIFO if for every route r, every link a\u2282r, and every two cumulative volume values v 1 \u2208 [0, gr ], v 2 \u2208 [0, ga ] the following condition always hold: (8) T ( r , a t , v 1 ) = T ( a , a t , v 2 ) \u21d4 T ( r , a h , v 1 ) = T ( a , a h , v 2 ) . Proposition 2 FIFO definition #4 is equivalent to FIFO definition #3. Proof Suppose FIFO definition #4 holds. Consider a pair of routes r 1, r 2 sharing segment s (s\u2286r 1, s\u2286r 2) and two cumulative volume values v 1 \u2208 [ 0 , g r 1 ] , v 2 \u2208 [ 0 , g r 2 ] . If T(r 1, n, v 1) < T(r 2, n, v 2) for all the nodes n \u2208 s, or for none of them, the conditions of definition #3 hold. Otherwise, there are two consecutive nodes, n 1, n 2 \u2208 s, such that the condition holds only for one of them. Denote the link connecting these nodes by a. Suppose that T(r 1, at, v 1) < T(r 2, at, v 2) but T(r 1, ah, v 1) \u2265 T(r 2, ah, v 2). (The proof for the case where T(r 1, at, v 1) \u2265 T(r 2, at, v 2) but T(r 1, ah, v 1) < T(r 2, ah, v 2) is practically identical and omitted here for the sake of conciseness.) Denote the corresponding cumulative volumes at the link by v'1 = V(a, at, T(r 1, at, v 1)) and v'2 = V(a, at, T(r 2, at, v 2)). Since there is positive flow on route r 1 at at right before T(r 1, at, v 1), there is flow on link a at at right before T(r 1, at, v 1), and hence T(a, at, v'1)= T(r 1, at, v 1). For the same reason T(a, at, v'2)= T(r 2, at, v 2). By FIFO definition #4, i.e. by (8), this implies that T(a, ah, v'1)= T(r 1, ah, v 1) and T(a, ah, v'2)= T(r 2, ah, v 2). In addition, since we assumed that T(r 1, at, v 1) < T(r 2, at, v 2), we get T(a, at, v'1) < T(a, at, v'2) meaning that v'1 < v'2 and that T(a, ah, v'1) < T(a, ah, v'2), so T(r 1, ah, v 1) < T(r 2, ah, v 2). Contradicting the choice of link a. In the other direction, suppose FIFO definition #3 holds. Consider a route r 0 traversing link a, and two cumulative volume values v 0 \u2208 [0, gr ], v \u2208 [0, ga ] such that T(r 0, at, v 0)= T(a, at, v)= t 0. (The proof if equality is assumed for ah is practically identical and omitted here for the sake of conciseness.) Let t'0 = T(r 0, ah, v 0). Denote all other routes traversing link a by r 1, r2, \u2026, rk, and let vi = V(ri, at, t 0), so that T(ri, at, vi ) \u2264 t 0. v = V ( a , a t , t 0 ) = \u2211 i = 0 k V ( r i , a t , t 0 ) = \u2211 i = 0 k v i . If V(ri, ah, t'0)= vi \u2200i =0, \u2026, k then V ( a , a h , t 0 \u2032 ) = v and T ( a , a h , v ) = t 0 \u2032 which is the requirement of FIFO definition #4. Suppose by contradiction that V ( r i , a h , t 0 \u2032 ) \u2260 v i for one (or more) of the routes, and (w.l.o.g.) assume it is the first route, i.e. V ( r 1 , a h , t 0 \u2032 ) \u2260 v 1 . We need to consider two cases, V ( r 1 , a h , t 0 \u2032 ) < v 1 and V ( r 1 , a h , t 0 \u2032 ) > v 1 . Case I: V ( r 1 , a h , t 0 \u2032 ) < v 1 . In this case T ( r 1 , a h , v 1 ) > t 0 \u2032 = T ( r 0 , a h , v 0 ) but by FIFO definition #3 this implies that T(r 1, at, v 1) > T(r 0, at, v 0)= t 0 which is a contradiction. Case II: V ( r 1 , a h , t 0 \u2032 ) > v 1 . In this case there is \u03b5 > 0 such that V ( r 1 , a h , t 0 \u2032 ) > v 1 + \u03f5 . So T ( r 1 , a h , v 1 + \u03f5 ) < t 0 \u2032 = T ( r 0 , a h , v 0 ) but by FIFO definition #3 this implies that T(r 1, at, v 1 +\u03b5) < T(r 0, at, v 0)= t 0. Therefore V(r 1, at, t 0) \u2265 v 1 +\u03b5 and again we get a contradiction. \u25a0 Comment: due to the possibility of discontinuities in T, and the possibility that traffic on one route will arrive (partially or completely) before traffic on the other route, using an equality condition in FIFO definition #3, where we deal with two separate routes, is problematic. These problems do not exist when the condition involves only one route and a link it traverses, as in FIFO definition #4. In Table 1 we described CSCP and DSCP representations as basic or very basic in terms of their level of abstractness, while not directly providing a proof of perfect FIFO (in Table 1 under the title \u201cFIFO proof\u201d in the right most column these representations are described as \u201cindirect\u201d). The remainder of this section is devoted to explaining these claims. Given any CTM or LTM solution (discretized at regular time steps) we can use linear interpolation to determine the CP at any node to support DSCP representation. (In this case interpolation of time as a function of volume and interpolation of volume as a function of time are in fact equivalent, assuming that the discontinuities are handled properly.) As mentioned before, simple linear interpolation can also be used to associate a CSCP representation with any DSCP solution. In this sense supporting CSCP and DSCP representations is not too complicated conceptually. The following example shows that such interpolation may contain FIFO violations, thus illustrating why the ability to support these representations does not directly lead to a proof of perfect FIFO. Consider two routes, r 1 and r 2, sharing one cell (or link) a with entrance capacity of 6 vehicles per time step and exit capacity of 4 vehicles per time step. In the first time step 6 vehicles from route r 1 enter the cell, and in the following time step 2 vehicles from route r 2 enter the cell. The cumulative volumes at the cell entrance and exit by route and time are given in Table 2 , using the regular pre-determined time step resolution. A simple linear interpolation here suggests that the last two vehicles on route r 1 exit in parallel with the two vehicles on route r 2, even though all vehicles on route r 1 entered the cell before all vehicles on route r 2. This is a clear FIFO violation, which can be demonstrated using FIFO definition #3 by noting (for example) that T(r 1, at , 5.4)=0.9 < T(r 2, at , 0.2)=1.1 but T(r 1, ah , 5.4)=2.7 > T(r 2, ah , 0.2)=2.1. The violation can also be demonstrated by FIFO definition #4, since T(r 2, at , 1)= T(a, at , 7)=1.5, but T(r 2, ah , 1)=2.5 \u2260 T(a, ah , 7)=2.75. With continuous-time cumulative-volume profiles the problem in the above example can be easily solved by adding a breakpoint at t =2.5. So while continuous representation of space is not necessary for FIFO verification, continuous representation of time cannot be given up so easily. In general, numerous irregular breakpoints may be necessary, these breakpoints may need to be different by node, and it is not at all clear if they can be pre-determined before the DNL solution is obtained. The challenges of adding enough breakpoints to ensure FIFO will be further discussed in Section 6. Terminology note: the term events (e.g. Henn, 2003; Raadsen et al., 2016) is somewhat similar to the term breakpoints used here, only that their events are related to changes in total link flows and our breakpoints stem also from changes in flow composition by commodity. It is worth noting that solutions with predetermined time-steps may also cause inaccuracies with respect to DNL conditions (other than FIFO). Some models (e.g. Newell, 1993a,1993b; Henn, 2003; Mazar\u00e9 et al., 2011; Raadsen et al., 2016) avoid such inaccuracies by determining the discretization points in time endogenously as part of the solution process. Daganzo (1994) offers other ways to eliminate, or at least control, such DNL inaccuracies. In any case, the breakpoints in time needed for exact DNL solution are not necessarily the same as those needed for FIFO verification. The example in Table 2 illustrates how FIFO violations can be identified in a DSCP solution using FIFO definition #3 or #4. Yet verifying FIFO using these definitions may be cumbersome, mainly because the definition covers an infinite number of cumulative volume values. The next section presents an alternative solution representation for which perfect FIFO verification may be determined by a finite process, and the proof of FIFO becomes direct, at least in some cases. 4 Cohorts with continuous node crossing times The key concept in the discussion from here on is the cohort. Some readers may consider cohorts as more abstract than cumulative-volume profiles. Towards the end of this section we will show that cohorts can be very useful for proving FIFO, thus (hopefully) justifying the additional conceptual efforts associated with their introduction. One way to describe a cohort is as the traffic along a specific route associated with a contiguous range of cumulative-volume values. Fig. 1 illustrates the concept of cohorts, and their connection to the 3D map of cumulative volumes. Every slanted line is this figure represents a trajectory, associated with a specific cumulative volume value. Each cohort pertains to a range of cumulative volume values, e.g. 3\u20134 or 10\u201310.5, i.e. a band between two lines in the figure (or any other trajectory lines, associated with two cumulative volume values). In a continuous setting we know the exact time interval each cohort crossed every node along the route (A, B, C, or D), or if necessary any other point along the route. In general the crossing time interval of a cohort is not necessarily aligned with time steps (as can be seen in the figure at the end of time step 4 at node C), but in this paper we often assume that the time intervals of cohorts lie within time steps used for the DNL grid-verification. The term cohort is closely related to various other terms used in the literature to describe grouped traffic, for example packets (Smith, 1993). The term cohort is preferred here as it conveys their layered nature within the cumulative volume values. The description of cohorts by a range of cumulative volumes implies that a cohort can never split or merge. In this sense cohorts are atomic, a fact that will be sometimes emphasized by the term atomic cohort. There are other ways to define cohorts or packets. In particular the term cohort can be used to describe an amount of traffic that travels together temporarily and then possibly split. While this point of view may be useful when DNL solutions are being constructed, in the context of this paper such interpretation may lead to confusions, and therefore it will be avoided. The specific meaning associated with cohorts in this paper is clarified by the following definitions: Definition Route-cohort is an amount of traffic that travels together along an entire route, without ever splitting, Definition Link-cohort is an amount of traffic that travels together along a single link without splitting. Cohorts can be introduced in several different ways. The first exposition of cohorts adopted here is as an additional layer of information for finite dimensional DSCP solutions. An alternative exposition will be examined in Section 5. A finite dimensional DSCP must include an interpretation scheme for generating continuous profiles from the finite dimensional information (in that sense such solutions are more restricted than general DSCP solutions). Piecewise linear interpolation is among the simplest interpretations possible, and probably the most convenient one for our purposes, thus we shall assume from here on that the DSCP is piecewise linear. (It is quite plausible that with minor modifications the same principles presented here can be used in conjunction with many other interpretation schemes, an option that will be further discussed in Section 5.) If a DSCP solution is given, then a route-cohort c can be formally defined by the route, r(c), and by a range of cumulative volume values, [V \u2212 (c), V + (c)]\u2286[0, g r(c)]. All other cohort attributes are derived from the range of cumulative volume values. The total volume (or amount of traffic) the cohort carries is denoted by d(c)= V + (c)\u2212 V \u2212 (c). The exact crossing time interval of each cohort at every node n, is denoted by [T \u2212 (c, n), T + (c, n)], which are determined as follows: T \u2212 (c, n)= TU (r(c), n, V \u2212 (c)), T + (c, n)= T(r(c), n, V + (c)). The term time interval is used here in distinction from the term time step, as clarified by the following definitions: Definition Time steps provide the discretization of time needed for grid-verification of DNL conditions which are not related to FIFO, e.g. capacities, merge ratios, etc. They are assumed to be predetermined, and usually all time-steps will be of the same duration. Definition Time intervals depict the discretization associated with FIFO verification, by cohorts or otherwise. Time intervals will often be irregular in duration, vary from node to node, and typically shorter than time steps. A time interval will be described as atomic to indicate that within the solution representation under consideration and for the specific node of interest no further division of the time interval will be considered. The set of all cohorts for route r is C(r). The order of cohort c in this set is o(c), ranging from 1 to |C(r)|. This order is assumed to be chronological at departure from the origin, and therefore by FIFO at any other node along r(c). The set of cohorts C(r) is said to be complete if there are no gaps, uncovered by any cohort, i.e. if: (9a) o ( c ) = 1 \u21d2 V \u2212 ( c ) = 0 (9b) o ( c ) = | C ( r ) | \u21d2 V + ( c ) = g r (9c) r ( c 1 ) = r ( c 2 ) a n d o ( c 1 ) + 1 = o ( c 2 ) \u21d2 V + ( c 1 ) = V \u2212 ( c 2 ) The set of cohorts is said to be sufficient if it picks all breakpoints in the CP's associated with route r, i.e. if: (10) T ( r ( c ) , n , ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) V \u2212 ( c ) + \u03b1 V + ( c ) ) = ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) T ( r ( c ) , n , V \u2212 ( c ) ) + \u03b1 T ( r ( c ) , n , V + ( c ) ) \u2200 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1 , \u2200 n \u2208 r , \u2200 c \u2208 C ( r ) Clearly given any finite-dimensional piecewise linear DSCP solution one can identify cohorts that satisfy the conditions of completeness and sufficiency. In principle zero volume cohorts can be allowed, but in the following we shall assume that zero volume cohorts have been omitted. As a result, we may have T + (c 1, n) < T \u2212 (c 2, n) even if r(c 1)= r(c 2)= r and o(c 1)+1= o(c 2). As mentioned above, cohorts in this context do not add or modify details about actual traffic in the DSCP solution; they are merely an additional layer providing another perspective on the same solution. In the above descriptions certain cohort attributes were derived from a DSCP solution, but in fact the opposite direction is also possible. The basic cohort information is the volume it carries, d(c) and the exact (continuous) times it crosses every node, [T \u2212 (c, n), T + (c, n)]. Given the basic information for all cohorts in C(r) we can determine its DSCP interpretation as follows: the chronological order of each cohort, o(c), can be determined by the order at departure from the origin; the values of [V \u2212 (c), V + (c)] and gr can be determined by the assumption of completeness (9); and the entire CP's can be determined by the interpolation (sufficiency) rule (10). In view of this perspective such solution representation shall be considered here as continuous-crossing-time-cohorts (CCTC). Note that the basic information is considered valid only if within-route FIFO is maintained, i.e. if T + (c 1, n) \u2264 T \u2212 (c 2, n) whenever o(c 1) < o(c 2) and r(c 1)= r(c 2). All of the discussion above regarding route cohorts can be readily transferred to link cohorts as well, with very few minor modifications in notation, namely: for link-cohort c the link it traverses will be denoted by a(c), and the set of all cohorts traversing link a will be denoted by C(a). The relations between crossing times of two cohorts c 1 and c 2, traversing the same node n, is highly important for our discussion. There are three primary possibilities. Definition Cohorts fully overlap at a node if their crossing time intervals are identical, i.e. T \u2212 (c 1, n)= T \u2212 (c 2, n) and T + (c 1, n)= T + (c 2, n). Definition Cohorts have no-overlap at a node if their crossing time intervals are completely distinct, with at most one edge-point of time in their intersection, i.e. T + (c 1, n) \u2264 T \u2212 (c 2, n) or T + (c 2, n) \u2264 T \u2212 (c 1, n). Definition Cohorts partially overlap at a node in all other cases, i.e. if they do not fully overlap but there is more than a single point of time in the intersection of their crossing time intervals. Cohorts may partially overlap in several different ways, which are listed in Section 8, together with the complications that may result from partially overlapping cohorts for FIFO verification. In this section and in Section 5 we will examine FIFO verification schemes for cohort solutions that do not contain any partial overlaps, as specifying priorities in this case is much simpler. Definition Priority of cohorts is considered formally as an order relationship, i.e. a binary reflexive and transitive relation over pairs of cohorts, specifying which cohort in a pair (if any) comes prior to the other. The specification of priorities is considered complete if the order relationship is total, i.e. if it is applicable to all pairs of cohorts whose routes traverse at least one common node. The main way used here to specify priorities of cohorts completely is by a priority function associating each cohort with an index value. This formal notion of priority and especially priority function should not be confused with the less formal notion of \u201cpriority rule\u201d used thus far to describe the general need in DNL models to determine how traffic streams interact. For a given node n, considering all cohorts traversing n, the relation of fully overlapping crossing interval is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, i.e. an equivalence relation. Therefore all cohorts passing through n can be divided into equivalence groups. The set of all breakpoints for n is (11) B ( n ) = { 0 , t m a x } \u222a \u222a c : n \u2208 r ( c ) o r n \u2208 a ( c ) { T \u2212 ( c , n ) , T + ( c , n ) } If the breakpoints are sorted, 0= b n, 0 < b n, 1 < b n, 2 < \u2026 < b n, |B(n)| = tmax , all atomic intervals can be indexed from 1 to |B(n)|. Under the assumption that there are no partial overlaps, we can define a complete node priority function p associating each cohort with a single atomic interval, defined such that (12) p ( c , n ) = i \u21d4 T \u2212 ( c , n ) = b n , i \u2212 1 & T + ( c , n ) = b n , i This function expresses priorities completely in the sense that if we consider two cohorts for the same route, c 1, c 2, r(c 1)= r(c 2), then o(c 1) < o(c 2)\u21d2p(c 1, n) < p(c 2, n). Another critical implication of this construction is that there are no breakpoints in the middle of the crossing interval of a single cohort, i.e. (13) ( T \u2212 ( c , n ) , T + ( c , n ) ) \u2229 B ( n ) = \u2300 , where (t 1, t 2) is the open set (excluding the edges) between t 1 and t 2. In that respect this situation where there are no partially overlapping cohorts can be described as satisfying cohort-breakpoint compatibility (CBC). FIFO definition #5 A CCTC solution with complete node priority functions fully satisfies FIFO if for every route r, every link a\u2282r, and every route-cohort c 1with r(c 1)= r there is a matching link-cohort c 2 with a(c 2)= a such that p(c 1, at )= p(c 2, at ) and p(c 1, ah )= p(c 2, ah ). Given a finite dimensional solution, the FIFO verification process implied by definition #5 is finite. For every route-cohort and every link it traverses a candidate matching link-cohort can be identified easily from the information at the link entrance, and a single condition at the link exit needs to be checked for every such cohort-link combination. More importantly, proving perfect FIFO is a direct result of the ability to satisfy CBC. Proposition 3 For any CCTC solution that satisfies FIFO definition #5, its DSCP interpretation satisfies FIFO definition #4. Proof Consider route r, link a\u2282r, and two cumulative volume values v 1 \u2208 [0, gr ], v 2 \u2208 [0, ga ] such that T(r, at, v 1)= T(a, at, v 2)= t 1. We need to show that T(r, ah, v 1)= T(a, ah, v 2). Consider the two breakpoints surrounding t 1, that is: b a t , i \u2212 1 = max { t \u2208 B ( a t ) : t < t 1 } and b a t , i = min { t \u2208 B ( a t ) : t \u2265 t 1 } . The cumulative volume along r increases just prior to t 1, i.e. between b a t , i \u2212 1 and b a t , i . Therefore, there must be a route-cohort c 1with r(c 1)= r such that T \u2212 ( c 1 , a t ) = b a t , i \u2212 1 and T + ( c 1 , a t ) = b a t , i . By FIFO definition #5, c 1 must have a matching link-cohort c 2 with a(c 2)= a, T \u2212 ( c 2 , a t ) = T \u2212 ( c 1 , a t ) = b a t , i \u2212 1 and T + ( c 2 , a t ) = T + ( c 1 , a t ) = b a t , i . The relative position of the point of time of interest, t 1, within these cohorts is \u03b1 = ( t 1 \u2212 b a t , i \u2212 1 ) / ( b a t , i \u2212 b a t , i \u2212 1 ) . Therefore so are the two cumulative volume values: v 1 = V \u2212 (c 1, at )+\u03b1 \u00b7 d(c 1) and v 2 = V \u2212 (c 2, at )+\u03b1 \u00b7 d(c 2). The matching of c 1 and c 2 also implies that they arrive together to node ah , that is T \u2212 ( c 1 , a h ) = T \u2212 ( c 2 , a h ) = b a h , j \u2212 1 and T + ( c 1 , a h ) = T + ( c 2 , a h ) = b a h , j . The position of interest within the cohorts at node ah is therefore t 2 = ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) \u00b7 b a h , j \u2212 1 + \u03b1 \u00b7 b a h , j . By the linear interpolation rule V(r, ah, t 2)= v 1 and V(a, ah, t 2)= v 2 and hence T(r, ah, v 1)= T(a, ah, v 2)= t 2. \u25a0 In general, every DSCP solution can be associated with numerous CCTC solutions. If two different CCTC solutions are associated with the same DSCP solution, they are in fact equivalent in terms of the actual flow pattern they represent. The remaining issue is how to choose a CCTC solution for a given DSCP solution, which we will begin to address in the remainder of this section, and continue to discuss in Section 6. In the context of the interface between the solution proponent and the FIFO verifier, we assume that choosing the CCTC solution is the responsibility of the solution proponent. This means that in a solution representation that supports cohorts, the FIFO verifier is allowed to ask for the list of all cohorts, and for the properties of each cohort. With this information she can then utilize FIFO definition #5, and determine whether network-wide FIFO is perfectly maintained. If the list of cohorts is finite, then the verification process will also be finite. For a DSCP solution satisfying FIFO definition #4, if it can be associated with a finite CCTC solution satisfying CBC, such solution must satisfy FIFO definition #5. But achieving CBC is not as trivial as it may seem. One way to attempt meeting CBC is to start with any CCTC, and determine all breakpoints at all nodes according to (11). If condition (13) is satisfied, we are done. Otherwise, split cohorts as much as needed to satisfy (13). However, since we want to satisfy (11) and (13) for all cohorts at all nodes simultaneously, the newly split cohorts may add breakpoints at other nodes. So it may take several iterations until CBC is satisfied. Whether such a process is necessarily finite (or tractable) will be discussed in Section 6. 5 Cohorts with complete priorities The information provided by the set of breakpoints at each node, B(n), and the node priority functions, p(c, n), is sufficient to reconstruct all crossing time values: T \u2212 (c, n)= b n, p(c, n)\u22121, T + (c, n)= b n, p(c, n). So a CCTC solution can in fact be fully described by d(c), o(c), p(c, n), and B(n). 4 4 In principle the order of cohorts within a single route, o(c), can be determined from their priorities at the origin (or at any other node) as given by p(c, n). But it is more convenient to assume that within each route o(c) is provided independently. The question we want to examine in this section is whether the continuous values of the breakpoints in B(n) are needed, or whether given the complete priority function it may be enough to retain the time step containing each atomic interval. This question, and as a result this section, are relevant only with grid-verification of other DNL conditions. When the DNL verification is grid-free, omitting the exact timing of breakpoints is not possible. DNL grid-verification requires cumulative volumes at every node for a (finite) predetermined set of time breakpoints, denoted as B 0(n)\u2282[0, tmax ]. For example, if \u03b4t is the common DNL time step, then B 0 ( n ) = { k \u00b7 \u03b4 t | k = 0 , 1 , \u2026 , t m a x \u03b4 t } is the same for all nodes. If the crossing interval of a single cohort spreads over more than one time step, then clearly we cannot associate a time step with each atomic interval, therefore we shall assume that the predetermined breakpoints are included in the final set of breakpoints, B 0(n)\u2286B(n). To illustrate the implication of this condition note that in Fig. 1 the end of time step 4 at node C occurs in the middle of the 2\u20132.5 cohort; so a cohort split is needed in order to meet this condition. For every atomic interval index 1 \u2264 i \u2264 \u03b2 n |B(n)|, the time step is determined by Ts (i, n)= bi /\u03b4t. Clearly Ts (i, n) is monotonically non-decreasing function of i for every node n. Complete-priority-cohorts (CPC) solution representation consists of the following: for every route r we know the number of associated cohorts |C(r)|; for every link a we know the number of associated cohorts |C(a)|; for every (route/link) cohort we know the total volume d(c) and the internal (within-route/within-link) order o(c); for every cohort and every node it traverses we know the priority index 1 \u2264 p(c, n) \u2264 \u03b2 n ; and for every node and every index 1 \u2264 i \u2264 \u03b2 n we know to which time step it belongs, Ts (i, n). FIFO definition #6 A CPC solution satisfies FIFO fully if the following conditions hold: 1 The time step Ts (i, n) is monotonically non-decreasing function of i for every node n. 2 Node priorities are complete and satisfy within-route (within-link) FIFO, i.e. for every two cohorts c 1, c 2, with the same route, r(c 1)= r(c 2) (or the same link, a(c 1)= a(c 2)), the following always hold: o(c 1) < o(c 2)\u21d2p(c 1, n) < p(c 2, n). 3 For every route r, every link a\u2282r, and every route-cohort c 1with r(c 1)= r there is a matching link-cohort c 2 with a(c 2)= a such that p(c 1, at )= p(c 2, at ) and p(c 1, ah )= p(c 2, ah ). Proposition 4 FIFO definitions #5 and #6 are equivalent in the following sense. If a CCTC solution satisfies FIFO definition #5 and each of its atomic intervals is within a single time step then its associated CPC solution satisfies FIFO definition #6, and if a CPC solution satisfies FIFO definition #6 then it can be associated with a CCTC interpretation that satisfies FIFO definition #5. Proof The first direction from CCTC to CPC is trivial. In the opposite direction, given a CPC solution the only values we need to choose in order to get a CCTC solution are the specific breakpoints at each node, i.e. B(n). The number of breakpoints needed in each time step k is dictated by |{i: Ts (i, n)= k}|. The exact positions of these breakpoints are insignificant, as they do not influence FIFO verification nor can they affect DNL grid-verification. So we can distribute them evenly, or by any other arbitrarily chosen rule, such as to maintain a constant flow through each node in each time-step. \u25a0 In certain stages of the previous discussions we assumed that the interpolation of cumulative volumes is done by a linear function. This assumption is in fact completely inconsequential when a CPC solution is considered, or when a CCTC solution is considered as long as each of its atomic intervals is within a single time step. Clearly any alternative interpolation rule will not affect DNL grid-verification, since only cumulative volumes on grid points are considered for this purpose. FIFO verification will also not be affected, as long as at every node in each atomic interval the same rule of interpolation is used for all cohorts. In conclusion, CPC representation, while possibly a bit more abstract than CCTC, is just as useful for FIFO verification and for proving perfect FIFO. 6 Tractability implications of cohort-breakpoint-compatibility Cohort-breakpoint-compatibility (CBC) was introduced in Sections 4 and 5 to prohibit partially overlapping cohorts. When satisfied, FIFO verification is finite, and in fact linear in the size of the solution (for each cohort and every node along the route of the cohort the solution contains at least one value representing the priority of the cohort at the node, and the verification by definitions 5 or 6 requires one operation for each cohort-link combination). The purpose of this section is to examine whether the number of cohorts needed to satisfy CBC may become intractable, or even infinite. The main example used in this section is specially designed to have a tractable DSCP solution, perfectly satisfying FIFO definition #4. The example shows why CBC may lead to intractable (or even infinite) number of cohorts, even though the \u201cobjective\u201d situation is easily tractable. The tractability of this example makes it illustrative in certain respects, but it may also mislead to a suggestion that the tractability problem is only due to CBC, and could be easily avoided while still ensuring perfect FIFO. At the end of the section we shall examine this suggestion in further detail. Consider the 6-nodes 8-links network in Fig. 2 . Suppose that the length of each outer link is 20m, the length of links [3,5] and [6,2] is 40m, the free flow speed is 20m/s, the backward wave speed is also 20m/s, the jam density is 1v/m and therefore the capacity is 10v/s (obtained when the density is 0.5v/m). In addition to the overall link capacities, there are bottlenecks at the exits from links [3,5] and [6,2] with a capacity limitation of 1v/s. Four routes are used: r 1 =[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; r 2 =[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]; r 3 =[4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]; r 4 =[4, 5, 6, 2, 3]. The initial flow on all routes is 1v/s, so there is no congestion and all traffic moves at free flow speed. At a certain time, t 0, the flow on route r 2 increases to 1+\u03b41 for one second, and the flow on route r 4 increases to 1+\u03b42 for one second. As a result queues of \u03b41 and \u03b42 vehicles are created on links [3,5] and [6,2] respectively, and the travel times on these links increase from 2 to 2+\u03b41 and 2+ \u03b42 respectively. Subsequently, flows return to their original values, so the new travel times remain unchanged for the remainder of the simulated period. The DSCP solution in this case can be fairly easily determined for each route separately. For example, for route r 2 the cumulative volume at the entrance to link [5,6] is zero until t = 3s, and then it increases at a constant rate of 1 v/s for the remainder of the simulation, while at the entrance to link [3,5] the cumulative volume value is zero until t = 2s, it increases linearly to the second breakpoint of V = t 0 vehicles at t = t 0 +2, the third breakpoint is V = t 0 +1+\u03b41 vehicles at t = t 0 + 3, and then the increase continues at 1 v/s for the remainder of the simulation. This solution satisfies FIFO definition #4 because the only segments shared by multiple routes are [1,2,3] and [4,5,6], and for each of the links in these segments the travel time is 1s at all times for all routes. The CBC condition requires that since t 0 is a breakpoint at node 1, it will be at the edge of a cohort on route r 1, so t 0 +1 \u2208 B(2); t 0 +2 \u2208 B(3); t 0 +3 \u2208 B(4). Now t 0 +3 should be at the edge of a cohort on route r 3 at node 4, so t 0 +4 \u2208 B(5); t 0 +5 \u2208 B(6); and t 0 +6 \u2208 B(1). Considering routes r 2 and r 3 we find that t 0 +6+\u03b41 \u2208 B(1) as well. The same cycles should also be considered in reverse, leading to t 0 +\u03b41 \u2208 B(1). Repeating the same argument we can show that { t 0 + k \u00b7 \u03b4 1 | k \u2208 Z } \u2229 [ t 0 , t max ] \u2286 B ( 1 ) . A similar argument considering routes r 3 and r 4 shows that { t 0 + k \u00b7 \u03b4 2 | k \u2208 Z } \u2229 [ t 0 , t max ] \u2286 B ( 1 ) . Furthermore, combining all the cycles in the network we get that { t 0 + k 1 \u00b7 \u03b4 1 + k 2 \u00b7 \u03b4 2 | k 1 , k 2 \u2208 Z } \u2229 [ t 0 , t m a x ] \u2286 B ( 1 ) . Which means that if \u03b40 is the greatest common divisor (GCD 5 5 Usually the greatest common divisor (GCD) is defined for positive integers. The definition can be easily extended to any positive numbers, \u03b41 and \u03b42, as sup ( { 0 } \u222a { \u03b4 0 | \u2203 k 1 \u2208 Z , k 2 \u2208 Z : \u03b4 1 = k 1 \u00b7 \u03b4 0 , \u03b4 2 = k 2 \u00b7 \u03b4 2 } ) . For example: GCD(1/2, 1/3)=1/6; GCD(4/7, 5/8)=1/56; GCD(20.5, 30.5)=0. ) of \u03b41 and \u03b42, then { t 0 + k \u00b7 \u03b4 0 | k \u2208 Z } \u2229 [ t 0 , t max ] \u2286 B ( 1 ) . As a result, the number of atomic intervals needed to satisfy the CBC condition in this simple example is very sensitive to the value of \u03b41 and \u03b42, and can easily become intractable. In fact, if either \u03b41 or \u03b42 is irrational, the result is an infinite number of breakpoints, and hence infinite atomic intervals and infinite cohorts. (Whether irrational values should be considered in practical DNL models is a separate issue.) In the above example the flows on each route can be determined independently, as they do not interact. Slight changes can cause complex interactions. For example, suppose that the bottlenecks are at the entrance to the downstream links of merge nodes 2 and 5, and that the durations of the high flows are enough to cause spillback. An exact solution in such a case may quickly become too cumbersome to enable a presentation that can be used to develop insights. To summarize, representation of DNL solutions by cohorts, whether as a CCTC or nearly equivalently as CPC, provide a possibility for finite verification of perfect FIFO. To be specific, given a finite CBC-maintaining cohort representation, the verification by FIFO definition #5 or #6 is a finite process, and its computation time is linear in the size of the representation. This FIFO verification method is considered only potentially finite, because in some DNL models maintaining CBC may lead to intractable (or even infinite) number of cohorts. In addition, if CBC can be achieved by a finite set of cohorts, then the proof of perfect FIFO can be derived directly from the ability to support CCTC or CPC representations. Unfortunately, this is not always possible. In the next sections we examine two ways to regain tractability. The first (Section 7) may seem relatively cumbersome, but it does ensure perfect FIFO. The second (Section 8) examines a much simpler possibility, namely omitting the requirement for complete priority of cohorts at each node. For the latter option tractability can be easily demonstrated, but unfortunately perfect FIFO cannot be ensured. 7 Cohort bundles In the previous section the flow on each route was divided into cohorts, each of which consists of a fixed quantity that stays together over time on an undivided time path from its origin to its destination. Since this paper does not deal with the way a solution is constructed, cohorts were introduced only as a way to verify FIFO in a given solution, which could be represented by its cohorts, by cumulative volumes, or by some other way. To enable FIFO verification, cohorts had to satisfy the complete-breakpoint-consistency (CBC) condition, which basically means that if a breakpoint is needed in the cumulative volume profile at any node, that breakpoint must be traced downstream all the way to the destination as well as upstream all the way to the origin. We saw that as a result of this CBC condition an infinite number of cohorts may be required. The purpose of this section is to suggest a solution representation in which the implications of tracing cohort splits backwards might not be as problematic. It seems that achieving this goal requires a certain complication of the representation. As a result of this complication, a complete evaluation of the properties of this representation is beyond the scope of this paper. In particular, the issues of tractability and whether a finite representation can be guaranteed will be discussed in a separate article. The focus here is on the formal exposition of the key components in such a solution, which is presented here as a variation of CPC solutions. The key idea is that for any given route the set of cumulative volume breakpoints of interest may increase as we proceed from node to node along the route. One way to formalize this concept is to introduce a new term, cohort-bundle (or bundle for short), to be defined shortly, while retaining the interpretation of the term cohort (or atomic cohort) equivalent to the usage of this term in the rest of this paper. Definition Cohort-bundle is a union (or a group) of consecutive cohorts following the same route, pertaining to a single specific node. A bundle will be considered atomic if it consists of a single cohort. To illustrate the idea consider Fig. 1, and assume that all cohorts contain a traffic volume of 0.5, so that every pair of consecutive lines represents a cohort. These can be bundled in different ways at different nodes. So for example the bundles at node A can be 0\u20133, 3\u20139, 9\u201312. At node B the second bundle may split to two descendent bundles, e.g. 3\u20135 and 5\u20139. At node C the bundles may split further to be 0\u20131, 1\u20133, 3\u20135, 5\u20136.5, 6.5\u20139, and 9\u201312. (If all grid points are taken into account, a more elaborate set of bundles is produced. This elaboration is not presented here as it does not contribute much to the understanding of the main features of bundles.) The next step is to formalize the concept of bundles mathematically. Bundles are viewed as an additional layer of information on top of cohorts. To be specific, every bundle u is associated with a specific route, r(u) \u2208 R, a specific node n(u) \u2208 r(u), and a set of cohorts C(u)\u2286C(r(u)) which must be consecutive, i.e. \u2200c 1, c 2 \u2208 C(u), c \u2208 C(r(u)), o(c 1) < o(c) < o(c 2) \u21d2 c \u2208 C(u). The total volume (or amount of traffic) of a bundle is denoted by d ( u ) = \u2211 c \u2208 C ( u ) d ( c ) . The set of bundles for route r and node n is denoted by U(r, n). Bundles are distinct, \u2200 u 1 , u 2 \u2208 U ( r , n ) : C ( u 1 ) \u2229 C ( u 2 ) = \u2300 , and covering, \u222a u \u2208 U(r, n) C(u)= C(r). A critical requirement is that bundles must be hierarchical, as illustrated in the above example, meaning that as we move from node to node along the route, \u201cthick\u201d bundles may split to \u201cthinner\u201d bundles, but they cannot interlace. Formally, for every link along the route, a \u2208 r, for any bundles at the nodes of the link, u 1 \u2208 U(r, at ), u 2 \u2208 U(r, ah ), if they share a cohort, C ( u 1 ) \u2229 C ( u 2 ) \u2260 \u2300 , then the second bundle must be included in the first, C(u 2)\u2286C(u 1). In this case we shall say that bundle u 2 is a descendant-bundle (or a split) of bundle u 1, and that u 1 is an ancestor-bundle of u 2. Any non-origin bundle u has a unique ancestor-bundle denoted by w(u). The set of all non-origin bundles is denoted by U 0. Similar to CPC we assume that the number of atomic intervals at every node n is denoted by \u03b2 n , and for every node and every index 1 \u2264 i \u2264 \u03b2 n we know to which time step it belongs, Ts (i, n). The main difference is that priorities are assigned only to bundles, rather than to (atomic) cohorts. So for every bundle, u \u2208 U(r, n), its priority is denoted by 1 \u2264 p(u) \u2264 \u03b2 n . This definition enables smaller numbers of atomic intervals. All of the above is applicable to link cohorts just as well. To maintain FIFO two conditions should hold at any given link: the ancestors of descendant bundles with the same priority should also have the same priority for all routes, and the volume distribution of ancestor bundles to descendant bundles should be consistent. To formalize these concepts let J(a, i) denote the pointer from priority index 1 \u2264 i \u2264 \u03b2 a h to the priority index of the appropriate ancestor along link a, and let \u03c6(a, i) denote the bundle splitting fraction associated with priority index 1 \u2264 i \u2264 \u03b2 a h at the head of link a. Note that atomic intervals associated with zero exiting flow, for example at the beginning of the simulation period, may not necessarily be associated with any cohort or bundle. To maintain generality of the notation for such cases as well we allow J(a, i) to be equal \u201cNULL\u201d if needed, and in these cases let \u03c6(a, i) = 0. FIFO definition #7 A cohort bundles (CB) solution fully satisfies FIFO if bundle splitting is consistent for all routes and links, that is if: (13a) p ( w ( u ) ) = J ( a , p ( u ) ) \u2200 u \u2208 U 0 , a = [ n ( w ( u ) ) , n ( u ) ] (13b) d ( u ) = \u03d5 ( a , p ( u ) ) \u00b7 d ( w ( u ) ) \u2200 u \u2208 U 0 , a = [ n ( w ( u ) ) , n ( u ) ] Proposition 5 Any CB solution that satisfies FIFO definition #7 has a DSCP interpretation that satisfies FIFO definition #4. Proof To generate a DSCP solution, the first step is to specify the exact timing of the breakpoints. If the DNL verification is grid-free, then we assume that these exact timings are provided. With DNL grid-verification, similar to the case of CPC solutions, the number of breakpoints needed at every node in each time step k is dictated by |{i: Ts (i, n)= k}|. Their exact positions are insignificant, and can be distributed evenly. Cumulative volumes for each link/route at the breakpoints are determined by the total volume associated with bundles. At all other times cumulative volumes are determined by linear interpolation. We can also define T \u2212 (u)=min c \u2208 C(u) T \u2212 (c) and T + (u)=max c \u2208 C(u) T + (c). The remainder of the proof is very similar to that of Proposition 3, only that in this case it is easier to go upstream from head node to the tail node (the opposite direction is also possible). Consider route r, link a\u2282r, and two cumulative volume values v 1 \u2208 [0, gr ], v 2 \u2208 [0, ga ] such that T ( r , a h , v 1 ) = T ( a , a h , v 2 ) = t 1 \u2208 [ b a h i \u2212 1 , b a h i ] . We need to show that T(r, at, v 1)= T(a, at, v 2). Consider the relevant route bundle u 1 and link bundle u 2 at ah , such that p(u 1)= p(u 2)= i. The relative position of the point of time of interest within this cohort is \u03b1 1 = ( t 1 \u2212 b a h i \u2212 1 ) / ( b a h i \u2212 b a h i \u2212 1 ) . The proportion of volume directed to prior descendant bundles of the same ancestor bundle is \u03b12 =\u2211 i' < i; J(a, i')= j \u03c6(a, i'), where j = J(a, i) is the ancestor priority index. Therefore the relative position of interest within the ancestor bundle is \u03b1=\u03b11 +\u03b12. Let t 2 = ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) \u00b7 b a t j \u2212 1 + \u03b1 \u00b7 b a t j . Due to bundle splitting consistency V(r, at, t 2)= v 1 and V(a, at, t 2)= v 2 and hence T(r, at, v 1)= T(a, at, v 2)= t 2. \u25a0 Cohort bundles solutions are therefore sufficient for perfect FIFO verification. In fact, any solution that supports a CB representation as described above is directly guaranteed to satisfy FIFO perfectly. So while CB is the most abstract structure discussed in this paper, it has important value for the discussion of perfect network-wide FIFO. A few additional clarification notes about CB solutions conclude this section. We can assume w.l.o.g. that a destination route bundle (as well as a head-node link bundle) contains a single cohort. If every bundle contains a single cohort then the CB solution is in fact equivalent to a CPC solution. In that sense CB is a generalization of CPC. In CB solutions full cohort enumeration is not necessary, since the entire solution can be reconstructed given: i Numbers of atomic intervals at every node, \u03b2 n \u2200n \u2208 N; ii Time step of each atomic interval, Ts (i, n) \u2200n \u2208 N \u22001 \u2264 i \u2264 \u03b2 n ; iii Ancestor pointers, J ( a , i ) \u2200 a \u2208 A \u2200 1 \u2264 i \u2264 \u03b2 a h ; iv Bundle splitting fractions, \u03d5 ( a , i ) \u2200 a \u2208 A \u2200 1 \u2264 i \u2264 \u03b2 a h . To reconstruct route cohorts, we can determine the number of cohorts by the number of atomic bundles at the destination. The list of ancestors can be determined by tracing the pointers backwards, and the volume can be determined by the bundle splitting fractions. Link cohorts can be determined in a similar fashion, starting from the atomic intervals at the head node. This representation is relatively compact, consisting of a small number of items per atomic interval. The number of atomic intervals may be large, but this issue remains to be explored in a separate publication. The above reconstruction begins from the bundles at the destinations. During a computational process of DNL solutions, downstream splitting may yet to be determined. In that sense the interpretation of bundles as a unification of cohorts, which are yet to be identified, is not necessarily too helpful. However, the structure of ancestor-descendant connections between bundles, with upstream pointers and splitting fractions, has valid interpretation even if only a partial solution has been computed. Utilization of this possibility for the development of a practical DNL computation process will also remain for exploration in a subsequent study. 8 Cohorts with time step histories From a CPC solution we can determine the history of time steps for every cohort, i.e. the list of time steps during which the cohort crossed each node along the way, Ts (c, n)= Ts (p(c, n), n). One may wonder whether providing these histories for each cohort, together with the total cohort volume d(c), as proposed by Smith (1993), might be sufficient for FIFO verification. In other words, do we really need the complete node priority functions and the mapping they provide from cohorts to sub-time-step atomic intervals? Clearly time-step-history-cohort (TSHC) representation is sufficient for DNL grid-verification. In fact, as far as DNL grid-verification is concerned, if two consecutive cohorts for a single route have identical time-step-histories they can be combined into one cohort without any loss of information that could affect DNL grid-verification. However, the implications for FIFO verification are far less obvious. One can easily produce an example where such cohort unification may lead to partial overlaps; hence FIFO verification as in CPC is not possible as that requires that there be no partial overlaps. For example, suppose that in the CPC solution cohorts c 1 and c 2 follow the same route and have identical history of time-steps. Suppose that there are two other cohorts c 3 and c 4, following two other routes. All four routes share one link (or a longer segment). The routes of cohorts c 3 and c 4 merge even before that, and cohort c 3 crosses the prior merging point before cohort c 4. In the segment shared by all four routes, cohort c 1 fully overlaps cohort c 3, and cohort c 2 fully overlaps cohort c 4. The split to cohorts c 1 and c 2 enables perfect FIFO verification using definition #6. Once cohorts c 1 and c 2 are combined to one cohort, c 0, this united cohort partially overlaps cohort c 3 and partially overlaps cohort c 4. In this specific example, we can start from a solution specifying only the time-step-histories of cohorts c 0, c 3, and c 4, and verify FIFO by splitting cohort c 0 to c 1 and c 2. The purpose of this section is to examine whether and how can FIFO be verified when a TSHC solution is given. One obvious possibility is by identifying an equivalent CPC interpretation. The key question is therefore whether there are any other options. In particular, it is natural to ask whether a FIFO definition with a similar structure to definitions #3 or #4 can be followed. To check whether strict equality or strict inequality can be used in such a definition for TSHC solution, Table 3 indicates which combinations exhibit direct FIFO violation and which are possible in a TSHC obtained from perfect FIFO CPC solution, when cohorts c 1 and c 2 traverse a shared segment that contains nodes n 1 and n 2. As Table 3 shows, strict equality or strict inequality cannot be used in a FIFO definition that is based on time-step-histories. The only option (as long as the overall structure of the definition remains similar to other definitions in this paper) is to use weak inequalities. FIFO definition #8 TSHC solution does not exhibit direct FIFO violation if for every pair of routes r 1, r 2 sharing segment s, every two nodes within s, n 1, n 2 \u2208 s, and every two cohorts c 1, c 2 with r(c 1)= r 1, r(c 2)= r 2, the following condition always holds: (14) T s ( c 1 , n 1 ) \u2264 T s ( c 2 , n 1 ) \u21d2 T s ( c 1 , n 2 ) \u2264 T s ( c 2 , n 2 ) . The following example shows a case where FIFO definition #8 is satisfied, but there cannot be any equivalent CPC interpretation that satisfies FIFO definition #6. The example is based on a network with six nodes and five links, illustrated in Fig. 3 . We consider four cohorts, with time-step-histories listed in Table 4 . For every pair of cohorts, either the shared segment consists only of link [3,4] (pairs A&D; B&C) where the time steps are the same for all cohorts, or it contains one more node. So in both cases (4A and 4B) there are no violations of FIFO definition #8. Yet in any CPC interpretation of the example in Table 4A FIFO definition #6 implies that p(A, 1) < p(B, 1)\u21d2p(A, 3) < p(B, 3); p(D, 2) < p(C, 2)\u21d2p(D, 3) < p(C, 3); p(C, 5) < p(A, 5)\u21d2p(C, 3) < p(A, 3); and p(B, 6) < p(D, 6)\u21d2p(B, 3) < p(D, 3). In other words p(A, 3) < p(B, 3) < p(D, 3) < p(C, 3) < p(A, 3) and that is a contradiction. The essence of the problem is that the information provided by a TSHC solution allows identifying a group of cohorts that crossed node 3 in time step 3 and node 4 in time step 4, but it provides only partial information about the priority relationship between these cohorts before and after this link. So we cannot determine which pairs of cohorts are fully overlapping, partially overlapping, or have strict priority relationship. Table 4B shows a slight modification from Table 4A, where the exit order from node 4 is switched, first cohorts A and D and then cohorts B and C. In this case the CPC interpretation can be p(A,3) = p(A,4) = p(D,3) = p(D,4) = 1 and p(B,3) = p(B,4) = p(C,3) = p(C,4) = 2. This interpretation does satisfy FIFO perfectly, while total flows do not change at all. The existence of two variants in Table 4, both satisfying FIFO definition #8, indicate that without additional assumptions time-step-histories may not be sufficient to fully determine priorities in dynamic models. It may be possible to enhance FIFO definition #8 in a way that excludes the situation illustrated in Table 4. However, more complex examples can be constructed, and ensuring that all such circumstances are handled properly could be fairly cumbersome. Similar complexities should be expected in any solution representation that allows partial overlaps. To begin with, there are several possibilities for partial overlap. For two partially overlapping cohorts c 1, c 2 the edges of the exact crossing intervals can be in one of eight situations: 1 a portion of c 1 is prior to c 2 and a portion of c 2 is after c 1, T \u2212 (c 1, n) < T \u2212 (c 2, n) < T + (c 1, n) < T + (c 2, n) 2 a portion of c 1 is prior to c 2 and they end together, T \u2212 (c 1, n) < T \u2212 (c 2, n) < T + (c 1, n)= T + (c 2, n) 3 a portion of c 1 is prior to c 2 and another portion of c 1 is after c 2, T \u2212 (c 1, n) < T \u2212 (c 2, n) < T + (c 2, n) < T + (c 1, n) 4 c 1 and c 2 start together and a portion of c 2 is after c 1, T \u2212 (c 1, n)= T \u2212 (c 2, n) < T + (c 1, n) < T + (c 2, n) 5 c 1 and c 2 start together and a portion of c 1 is after c 2, T \u2212 (c 1, n)= T \u2212 (c 2, n) < T + (c 2, n) < T + (c 1, n) 6 a portion of c 2 is prior to c 1 and another portion of c 2 is after c 1, T \u2212 (c 2, n) < T \u2212 (c 1, n) < T + (c 1, n) < T + (c 2, n) 7 a portion of c 2 is prior to c 1 and they end together, T \u2212 (c 2, n) < T \u2212 (c 1, n) < T + (c 1, n)= T + (c 2, n) 8 a portion of c 2 is prior to c 1 and a portion of c 1 is after c 2, T \u2212 (c 2, n) < T \u2212 (c 1, n) < T + (c 2, n) < T + (c 1, n) Any transition from one of these eight situations to another constitutes by itself a violation of FIFO (in the sense that a CPC interpretation satisfying FIFO definition #6 is not feasible). This is in addition to the complication illustrated in Table 4. A tentative conclusion from these observations is that the priority functions in the CPC and CB solutions are important for enabling direct and finite FIFO verification. 9 Summary and conclusions The concept of first-in-first-out is very straight forward, and can be easily expressed in a natural (although not necessarily fully formal) manner, for example by FIFO definition #1. Continuous space cumulative-volume profile (CSCP) solutions can be used to formalize the definition of perfect FIFO, as in FIFO definition #2. Many continuous flow dynamic models represent the solution only at nodes, and such discrete-space cumulative-volume profile (DSCP) solutions are just as sufficient for purposes of FIFO verification. This can be done by route-to-route comparison, as in FIFO definition #3, or by route-to-link comparison as in FIFO definition #4. The FIFO verification process can be potentially finite if cohorts are introduced, whether they are associated with continuous crossing times (CCTC) or with complete priorities (CPC), using FIFO definitions #5 and #6 respectively. In addition, cohorts can be grouped into bundles, as in CB solutions. All of the above solution representations and perfect FIFO definitions are in essence equivalent, as proven formally in this paper. Proving FIFO is a direct outcome of the ability to support the CB representation, and possibly the case with CCTC or CPC representations. On the other hand, DSCP and CSCP representations do not offer a direct way for proving FIFO. The last representation considered in this paper is by time-step-history-cohorts (TSHC). Since the number of time-steps is finite, the number of possible histories is also finite. Therefore such solution representation is by definition finite-dimensional. The number of cohorts in such solutions could be fairly large, but may still be practically tractable, at least in some cases. Intuitively it may seem as if time-step-histories should also be sufficient to ensure FIFO, but unfortunately this is not the case. The natural way to define FIFO in association with TSHC solutions, FIFO definition #8, is not equivalent to the other definitions of perfect FIFO discussed here. In addition, by itself this definition is not sufficient to uniquely determine the priority rules, thus enabling multiple solutions to the same situation. Finally, if cohorts with identical time-step-history over their shared segments are assumed to have equal priority, and if such cohorts are expected to proceed spanning the same range of time steps with equal proportions, contradictory requirements may arise under certain circumstances. A key message of this paper is that perfect network-wide FIFO requires unbounded number of discretized elements of flow. It is true that allowing the discretization points to be determined during the solution computation process may be useful not only for satisfying perfect FIFO, but also for example in exact grid-free wave-front methods. In both cases the number of breakpoints/events may grow quickly with the model duration. It should be clarified that this conclusion is not proven formally in the paper, yet the arguments made in the paper are sufficient (in our opinion) to realize why this conclusion is reasonable. As such, this is only a tentative conclusion. In summary, from all of the representations considered in this paper, cohort bundles seem to be the most promising direction. While its structure is a bit cumbersome, and not as intuitive as the other alternatives, it can be used to demonstrate perfect FIFO, and it overcomes (at least partially) the circumstances that lead to infinite verification process with other representations. Further exploration of cohort bundle solutions, especially in terms of tractability, remains a subject for future research.

One of them is the way priorities of different traffic streams (commodities) are managed. This is particularly challenging when flows are treated as continuous. It is common to consider the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) rule as a baseline for setting priorities; but most practical continuous flow dynamic models do not satisfy FIFO perfectly. This paper examines the difficulties associated with full adherence to network-wide FIFO. We examine six different ways to represent dynamic flow solutions over a network, and for each representation we discuss whether it is sufficient for verifying FIFO, whether the verification process is finite, and whether proving FIFO can be directly implied. Throughout the evaluation eight alternative definitions of FIFO are considered, seven of them are shown to be essentially equivalent, while the last definition is not, and may therefore be considered as \u201cweak\u201d FIFO. The most promising representation appears to be the one denoted as \u201ccohort bundles,\u201d while somewhat more abstract than the other representations, supporting this representation directly shows perfect FIFO satisfaction. Further evaluation of this representation remains a subject for future research. In a nutshell, the key conclusion of this analysis is that in order to satisfy perfect network-wide FIFO the number of discretized elements of flow should probably be allowed to grow quickly and unboundedly with model duration, and it cannot be determined a-priori. These insights about the challenges of incorporating FIFO in continuous flow dynamic models, which may be relevant also for other behavior-based priority rules, can help modelers and practitioners set realistic expectations regarding the level of control over priority rules that can be achieved within finite-dimensional continuous flow dynamic models.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2017-06-30", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191261516305458", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Bar-Gera, Hillel"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Carey, Malachy"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191261516305458"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261516305458"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0191-2615(16)30545-8", "prism:volume": "100", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier Ltd.", "dc:title": "Representation requirements for perfect first-in-first-out verification in continuous flow dynamic models", "prism:copyright": "\u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
