"Transportation Research Part B: MethodologicalBehavioral mechanism design for transportation services: Laboratory experiments and preference elicitation costAbstract We herein use the results of laboratory experiments to study the effects of preference-elicitation mechanisms on the efficiency of auctions. Transportation and reservation service providers need to know the potential user demand. However, the preference-elicitation method can impact the elicitation results. In this study, we experimentally analyze the effects of preference-elicitation mechanisms on users\u2019 eliciting behaviors and on the efficiency of auction results. In addition, we show that our preference-elicitation mechanism can reduce users\u2019 bidding cost and improve the efficiency of auction results. Finally, we examine users\u2019 behaviors in laboratory experiments to estimate their preference-elicitation costs.serial JL 271728 291210 291772 291817 31 Transportation Research Part B: Methodological TRANSPORTATIONRESEARCHPARTBMETHODOLOGICAL 2018-08-01 2018-08-01 2018-08-01 2018-08-01 2019-07-13T16:43:54 1-s2.0-S0191261518301474 S0191-2615(18)30147-4 S0191261518301474 10.1016/j.trb.2018.07.008 S300 S300.2 FULL-TEXT 1-s2.0-S0191261518X00083 2019-07-13T16:04:21.772478Z 0 0 20180901 20180930 2018 2018-08-01T17:50:49.860194Z articleinfo articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright crossmark dateloaded dateloadedtxt datesearch datesort dateupdated dco docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid indexeddate issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdateend pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sectiontitle sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype ssids alllist content subj subheadings suppl tomb volfirst volissue volumelist webpdf webpdfpagecount yearnav figure table body mmlmath acknowledge affil articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authkeywords authlast grantnumber grantsponsor grantsponsorid highlightsabst orcid primabst ref 0191-2615 01912615 true 115 115 C Volume 115 11 231 245 231 245 201809 September 2018 2018-09-01 2018-09-30 2018 Research papers article fla \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Table 1 Setting 1 Setting 2 Setting3 \u2022 The time you start working is 9 o\u2019clock. It takes ten minutes on foot from your home to the boarding station. It takes 45 minutes by commuter train from the boarding station to the exiting station and there is no transfer. It takes five minutes on foot from the exiting station to your workplace. \u2022 You are sent to Fukuoka on business for a meeting. The meeting begins at 1:00 p.m. It takes 15 minutes from Fukuoka airport to the meeting place. You need to use the flight from Haneda (Tokyo) airport to Fukuoka airport, which takes approximately two hours. You do not need to go to your workplace in the morning, and you can go to Haneda airport directly. \u2022 You will go to Okinawa for a leisure trip on a weekend vacation. It is an overnight stay. The return flight time has already been decided, because of your family\u2019s schedule (or a friends\u2019). It is 6 p.m. on Sunday. You can choose the outgoing flight time on Saturday freely. \u2022 The frequency of the train is every 15 minutes. The one-way railway fare is 360 yen.

Abstract We herein use the results of laboratory experiments to study the effects of preference-elicitation mechanisms on the efficiency of auctions. Transportation and reservation service providers need to know the potential user demand. However, the preference-elicitation method can impact the elicitation results. In this study, we experimentally analyze the effects of preference-elicitation mechanisms on users\u2019 eliciting behaviors and on the efficiency of auction results. In addition, we show that our preference-elicitation mechanism can reduce users\u2019 bidding cost and improve the efficiency of auction results. Finally, we examine users\u2019 behaviors in laboratory experiments to estimate their preference-elicitation costs. Keywords Behavioral mechanism design Transportation service auction Preference elicitation Laboratory experiments 1 Introduction All transportation systems involve supply constraints per unit time, and there can be traffic congestion and crowded trains. Therefore, having a mechanism for appropriately allocating a limited supply capacity to users is essential for the transportation services. Auction mechanisms are currently receiving increasing attention as one such method. In auction and reservation systems (e.g., tradable permit systems for transportation services), it is important for service providers to be able to predict the potential user demand. Many previous studies have focused on auction-based schemes for transportation systems and services, including tradable credit schemes (Viegas, 2001; Yang and Wang, 2011; Wu et al., 2012; Nie and Yin, 2013) and permit systems (Verhoef et al., 1997; Akamatsu, 2007; Wada and Akamatsu, 2013; Hara and Hato, 2018a). In an empirical study on a transportation service auction, Hara and Hato (2018b) demonstrated the significance of the bidding behavior of users under uncertainty and the effects of the cognitive cost for users on the auction results. However, no studies have been reported on evaluating the cognitive cost of users\u2019 bidding behavior and empirically establishing a relation between the efficiency of auctions and the elicitation methods. First, we describe the concept and research question of this study. From the viewpoint of traditional mechanism design, there are mainly 4 elements in Fig. 1 . First element is transport or activity demand of users. In general, it is the valuations or bidding values of transport system for users. And second element is efficient allocation for social good. The objective of mechanism designer is allocating the resources efficiently by using users\u2019 valuations. The third element is constraint conditions of transportation system. To decide the allocation, the mechanism designers need to satisfy the constraint conditions such as capacity limit and some conditions. The forth element is the incentive for strategy-proofness. If the payments for users are irresponsible, users can tell a lie and they can get larger utilities than telling truth. Therefore, the payments for users need the incentive design. These elements are the significant elements for traditional mechanism design. However, as Hara and Hato (2018b) demonstrated, users rarely represent their all information. From the result, the viewpoint of this study extends the traditional mechanism design framework. It means the true and latent transport demand is different from that represented by users. And we assume that the latter is the part of the former because it is observed partially. The reason why the former is partially represented by users is that users have the unobserved constraint conditions such as transaction cost, cognitive burden, cognitive bias, misunderstanding and so on. They are collectively called preference elicitation cost in this study. With respect to the cognitive cost of preference elicitation in an auction, we must think of the following three problems: 1. Does a preference-elicitation cost for bidding values or representing the willingness to pay (WTP) really exist? 2. If they do exist, to what extent can the preference elicitation cost be evaluated? 3. Is it possible to design preference-elicitation mechanisms that can reduce such a preference-elicitation cost? This study aims to answer these three questions through empirical analysis using laboratory experiments. These research questions are significant in transportation services because the theory of the mechanism design itself cannot be applied in the deployment and implementation of transportation services. It is essential for real-world services and policies in areas like transportation services to raise the level of mechanism design to that of \u201cbehavioral mechanism design.\u201d Needless to say, \u201cbehavioral mechanism design\u201d is a broad concept beyond the scope of this paper. However, this is the first step for combining traditional mechanism design, desirable preference elicitation, and empirical behavior analysis. In this study, we used the results of laboratory experiments to analyze the effects of preference-elicitation mechanisms on the efficiency of auctions. The service providers of transportation services and reservation systems need the accurate assessments of potential user demand. However, the user interface and preference-elicitation method can have an impact on the results elicited from the users. The contributions of this study can be summarized in the following six points. \u2022 We designed and executed laboratory experiments to analyze the differences in elicitation mechanisms for transportation service auctions. \u2022 We introduced a survey system based on the Bayesian truth serum (BTS) (Prelec, 2004) which encourages subjects to improve their response accuracy. \u2022 Based on the experiments, we empirically showed that valuations and the number of representations vary depending on the preference-elicitation mechanism. \u2022 Differences in the number of representations resulted in a thin market, that is, a market with a few transactions. As a consequence, the differences in the number of representations can reduce the efficiency of the auction results. \u2022 We showed that we can significantly improve the efficiency of an auction by increasing the number of preference representations using a preference-prediction mechanism. \u2022 We empirically estimated the preference-elicitation cost for users on the basis of the experimental results. As the estimated elicitation cost is very large, a na\u00efve preference-elicitation mechanism has a negative effect on the auction efficiency, and the results demonstrate the importance of the preference-prediction mechanism. 2 Literature review 2.1 Transportation system auction There are two types of transportation auctions. The first one is an auction for general users, such as for tradable permits and credit. There have been many studies on this type of auction, such as those by Akamatsu (2007), Yang and Wang (2011), Wu et al. (2012), Nie and Yin (2013), and Wada and Akamatsu (2013). Those studies examined tradable permit systems for road networks. In addition, Hara and Hato (2018a) studied a tradable permit system for mobility sharing services. Such studies had two primary objectives. The first objective was to efficiently allocate transportation systems. The other was to understand the real preferences of users using a bidding and market mechanism. In these studies, The incentive-compatible bidding value is often used in the Vickrey\u2013Clarke\u2013Groves (VCG) mechanism (Vickrey, 1961; Clarke, 1973; Groves, 1973) to resolve the asymmetry of information between users and suppliers. There is no problem if all users are rational. However, if they have transaction costs, the cognitive burdens of bidding or representing their preferences will prevent the tradable permit system and auction mechanism from working well. Nie (2012) and He et al. (2013) analyzed the impact of transaction costs on tradable permit schemes. They showed that the outcomes of such systems depend theoretically on the initial allocation of mobility credits. This shows that the design of the system is important. Some solutions have been proposed for alleviating the cognitive burdens of bidding or representing preferences. For example, Wada and Akamatsu (2013) proposed a day-to-day mechanism for tradable permit auctions. Nevertheless, the preference-elicitation problem is not easy to solve, as Sandholm and Boutilier (2005) suggested. The other type of transportation auction is the auction for logistics. Xu and Huang (2014) and Huang and Xu (2013) conducted research on procurement auctions in logistics. Generally, in transportation auction studies, there has been a focus on the procurement of logistics and allocation of slots at airports. As a feature of auctions for logistics, the set of bidders is limited and the bidders are all companies, as compared with tradable permit auctions. These companies tend to be more rational than general agents. Therefore, there is a little need for logistic auctions to take the cognitive burdens of bidders into account. On the other hand, general users in transportation services rarely do a lot of thinking about their bidding. They follow their intuitions. At that time, the preference elicitation cost can creep in their decision-making. Nevertheless, many analyses based on auction theory have paid less attention to the preference-elicitation cost for bidding. As the effect of the preference-elicitation cost on an auction\u2019s result is not obvious, this study focuses on it. 2.2 Preference elicitation Initially, there is a trade-off between the benefit from the allocation of auction results and the preference-elicitation cost. Chajewska et al. (2000) and Boutilier (2002) focused on such trade-offs in auctions. Chajewska et al. (2000) modeled the preference-elicitation problem as a Bayesian update process of the probability distribution of users\u2019 utility functions by suppliers. Each user represents a query regarding information on his/her WTP to an auction administrator, and the administrator uses their queries to update the users\u2019 valuation distributions. Chajewska et al. (2000) assumed that the administrator sequentially maximizes the value of information, and Boutilier (2002) assumed that the administrator maximizes the value of information using a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) that aims to globally maximize the value of information. Fleming and Cohen (2004) and Cohen et al. (2005) modeled the decision-making process with a bother cost for preference elicitation. They used numerical simulations to express the bother cost and verify its effect. The services analyzed in this study are transportation service permits by time slots. It is reasonable to assume that there is a specific relationship between the valuations of transportation service permits of each time slot. Specifically, we can estimate the schedule cost function that is popular in departure time choice modeling. This function has an early arrival cost and a late arrival cost for the desired arrival time. Since transportation service permits have such a relationship, transportation service auctions can elicit users\u2019 preferences easily. In this study, we use empirical users\u2019 bidding data to verify some preference-elicitation mechanisms and to estimate users\u2019 elicitation costs. 2.3 WTP Problems related to the accuracy of preference elicitation and bidding values are similar to the problem related to the accuracy of WTP surveys. Although there have been many studies on the improvement of WTP surveys using the contingent valuation method, the handling of WTP remains difficult. Cummings and Taylor (1998), List et al. (1998), List and Gallet (2001), and List (2001) pointed out that there are subjective bias, scope nonresponsiveness, and difficulty in correct value judgment for unknown objects in WTP surveys. To improve the accuracy of a survey that includes value judgment on such subjectivity and unknown objects, Prelec (2004) proposed a BTS approach, which is promising as an incentive-consistent investigation method. This is a kind of scoring rule for answers to categorical questions, in which the BTS score calculated by a calculation rule expresses the truth as the answer. It has been shown that highly truthful answers can be elicited by linking this score to an incentive. As part of these trends, Ding (2007) proposed an incentive-aligned mechanism for conjoint analysis. Currently, the incorporation of incentive compatibility into survey design is increasing in popularity in fields like psychology and marketing science. It is difficult to incorporate incentive-compatible survey designs into paper-based surveys. However, since computer-based (web-based) surveys are now popular, incentive compatibility can be incorporated easily into any survey. We use BTS scores in this study to retain the accuracy of survey samples and to improve the survey accuracy by eliminating lower-score subjects. 3 Experimental design for the relationship between WTP and elicitation mechanisms 3.1 The objective of our experiments The principal objective of our laboratory experiment is to demonstrate the existence of a cognitive cost of individuals in representing their WTP for transportation services. A further objective is to empirically demonstrate that the cognitive cost has a detrimental effect on auction results and social welfare. Therefore, we observe representation behaviors under conditions that are identical other than for the elicitation mechanisms used. We also analyze the effects of the difference in elicitation mechanisms on the efficiency of auction results, for example, the WTPs for each transportation service and the number of representations in which participants represent a positive WTP. The anticipated results of our laboratory experiment follow: 1. The differences in elicitation mechanisms have some effects on the quality of participants\u2019 representations, such as the number of representations. This means that we really need to take account of the preference-elicitation cost. 2. As a result, the differences in elicitation mechanisms affect the efficiency of auction results through the quality of participants\u2019 representations, and na\u00efve elicitation mechanisms degrade the efficiency of auction results. 3.2 Overview of the experiments This section provides an overview of the experiments in this study. Our experimental design is the randomized controlled trial (RCT). We contacted through a marketing research company 1647 participants, aged 20\u201359, job holders in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and we divided them into three random groups ( n 1 = 550 , n 2 = 547 , and n 3 = 550 ). Each group was assigned a different WTP elicitation mechanism. Next, each participant indicated his/her WTP for transportation services on our website. In the experiment, we asked the participants about their WTPs for some transportation service permits or usage rights in three different situations. At the end of the experiment, the participants were asked to predict the average WTP of the other participants in each situation. This is the summary of this experimental procedure. We explain our setting of each situation and the intention of the setting. In Situation 1, we ask the participants about their WTP for an unknown service. The transportation service of Situation 1 is a reserved seat for a rush-hour commuter train in the Tokyo metropolitan area. In Tokyo, and even in many cities in other countries, reserved seats in commuter train and subway are not typical. Therefore, reserved seats for a rush-hour commuter train is a kind of unknown services. In Situation 2, we ask the participants about their WTP for a business trip. The transportation service of this situation is a flight from Tokyo to Fukuoka on a business trip. In Situation 3, we ask the participants about their WTP for a leisure trip. The transportation service of this situation is a flight from Tokyo to Okinawa on a leisure trip. Regarding these three situations, we clarify the differences among three elicitation mechanisms. In Table 1 , we describe the details of the three settings. 3.3 The three types of elicitation mechanisms Here, we explain our three elicitation mechanisms. Three participant groups ( n 1 = 550 , n 2 = 547 , n 3 = 550 ) answer regarding their WTPs for the same three settings (reserved seat, business trip flight, and leisure trip flight). However, the elicitation mechanisms of the web-based survey for the respective groups are different. The first group uses a step-by-step elicitation mechanism, the second group uses an all-at-once elicitation mechanism, and the third group uses a preference-prediction mechanism. Fig. 2 shows the representation method used by each group to indicate their WTP. The step-by-step elicitation mechanism is the simplest one. Fig. 2(a) illustrates the concept of step-by-step elicitation. First, a participant selects the most desirable time slot permit/ticket from the list of all permits/tickets. If the participant does not want any of them, he/she can end the representation process. Next, if the participant does select the most desirable one, then he/she will supply the WTP for the permit/ticket. After the answer, the participant returns the list of all the permits/tickets other than the selected ones. If the participant desires any of them, then he/she selects the most desirable one from the list and provides the WTP repeatedly. Otherwise, the participant ends the representation process. In this elicitation mechanism, participants repeat the selection and representation of WTP, and the system can obtain the WTP of transportation services in a descending order. However, since the elicitation mechanism has many page transitions in a web site, we suppose that the cognitive costs of the participants are large. The second mechanism is the all-at-once elicitation. Fig. 2(b) illustrates the concept of all-at-once elicitation. In this mechanism, the system provides the text box input system for the entire list of transportation service permits/tickets. In all of the text boxes, there are default values of zero yen. The participants can freely enter the WTP of each permit/ticket. If the participant wants to finish entering the WTP that he/she wants, then he/she can complete the answer. This mechanism is different from the step-by-step elicitation mechanism in that there is no explicit choice and ranking. The third mechanism is preference-prediction elicitation. Fig. 2(c) illustrates this concept. In this mechanism, the participant first selects the most desirable time slot permit/ticket from the entire list of all permits/tickets and then answers the WTP in the same manner as in the step-by-step elicitation mechanism. Next, the system predicts the WTPs of other permits/tickets with the prediction method assuming the schedule delay cost. Then, the system graphically shows the predicted WTPs to the participant. If the participant can accept the predicted WTPs of other permits/tickets, the elicitation mechanism ends. Otherwise, the participant can correct one WTP among the predicted WTPs. According to the modification by the participant, the system modifies the predictions of the WTPs of other permits/tickets. This elicitation mechanism repeats these steps until the participant finishes. The characteristics of the elicitation mechanism are the prediction of WTPs by the system and the graphical representation for participants. Now, we explain the procedure of the preference-prediction mechanism in detail. This procedure was proposed by Hara (2015). Step.0 We set the initial parameters a 0(\u202f\u2265\u202f0), aL (\u202f\u2264\u202f0), and v 0 = 0 . In this case, the valuation vector that the preference-prediction mechanism proposes initially is v ^ ( t ) = v 0 = 0 \u2200 t \u2208 T . Hence, the initial valuations are zero in all time slots. Step.1 We designate q k = ( t k , v ( t k ) ) as the kth representation of the user. tk is the time slot of usage rights, and v(tk ) is the valuation of the time slot. Given k representations, which means q 1 , q 2 , \u2026 , q k , the preference-prediction mechanism sorts the time slots in an ascending order, and reindexes the time slots as t s 1 , \u2026 , t s k . Then, the preference-prediction mechanism computes the valuation vector as follows: v ^ ( t | q k ) = { 0 if t \u2264 t 0 , a 0 t \u2212 a 0 t s 1 + v ( t s 1 ) if t 0 < t \u2264 t s 1 , a j t + b j if t s j \u2264 t \u2264 t s j + 1 , \u2200 j \u2208 { 1 \u2026 , k \u2212 1 } , a L t \u2212 a L t s k + v ( t s k ) if t s k \u2264 t < t L , 0 if t L \u2264 t , where t 0 \u2261 t s 1 \u2212 v ( t s 1 ) a 0 , a j \u2261 v ( t s j + 1 ) \u2212 v ( t s j ) t s j + 1 \u2212 t s j , b j \u2261 v ( t s j ) t s j + 1 \u2212 v ( t s j + 1 ) t s j t s j + 1 \u2212 t s j , t L \u2261 t s k \u2212 v ( t s k ) a L . Step.2 If the user stops providing representations, the preference-prediction mechanism also stops. Otherwise, the process returns to Step 1. With such a preference-prediction mechanism, users can provide much of their own private information to the service provider with a single representation. The preference-prediction mechanism approximates the valuations of time slots that users do not represent by creating a convex hull with respect to the represented valuations. When there is a relationship between the valuations of before time slots and those of after time slots, the service provider can create a users\u2019 valuations vector with a small number of representations using the interpolated valuations. In the case of transportation services, there are many cases in which the desired departure and arrival times occur, and therefore the assumption relating the valuation of time slots is appropriate. In this manner, this mechanism can reduce the number of representations in many cases. 4 Experimental results of the preference elicitation mechanism 4.1 Preprocessing for reliability improvement The number of participants in the three preference-elicitation mechanisms is 550, 547, and 550, respectively. However, since the survey method is web-based, there can be a problem with the reliability of the experimental data obtained. To remove the problematic data, we use the BTS approach of Prelec (2004) as data preprocessing. BTS is a kind of incentive design-based survey method. In the BTS setting, the participants are asked to represent their own answers and predict other participants\u2019 answers. For example, in a binary question setting, the participant must provide his/her own answer of one or zero and provide the ratio of other participants who answer one. Each participant is identified by i, and the number of participants is N. In a binary question setting, xi \u202f\u2208\u202f{0, 1} is the answer of participant i, and yi \u202f\u2208\u202f[0, 1] is the prediction of participant i. Using these answers, the researcher calculates the reliability score of each participant\u2019s answer. This is the BTS score. (1) BTS Score i = x i \u00b7 log x \u00af y \u00af + \u03b1 \u00b7 x \u00af \u00b7 log y i x \u00af where x \u00af = \u2211 i = 1 N x i / N , log y \u00af = \u2211 i = 1 N log y i / N , and \u03b1\u202f\u2208\u202f(0, 1) is a hyperparameter. A participant\u2019s BTS score can be divided into information and prediction score terms, where the first term indicates his/her information score and the second term indicates his/her prediction score. If a participant answers \u201cYes\u201d in relation to the question whose real \u201cYes\u201d ratio is larger than the predicted \u201cYes\u201d ratio, the information score increases, and vice versa. The prediction score is a penalty proportional to the relative entropy (or Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence) between the empirical distribution and the prediction of that distribution. The best prediction score is zero, which is attained when the prediction matches the reality exactly. To maximize the BTS score of participant i, he/she must distinguish truth telling from Bayesian reasoning. When all participants answer truthfully, this is the Bayesian Nash equilibrium. As a result, the BTS score is the reliability score of each participant\u2019s answer. In this experiment, participants are asked to provide their own WTP and their predictions of the average WTP of other participants. Since these are continuous variables, we extend the BTS score. We designate x i \u2208 R + as the WTP of user i and y i \u2208 R + as the predicted value of other participants\u2019 average WTP that user i estimated. The mean value of all users\u2019 WTP is \u03bc x = 1 N \u2211 i = 1 N x i , the variance of all users\u2019 WTP is \u03c3 x 2 = 1 N \u2211 i = 1 N ( x i \u2212 \u03bc x ) 2 , the mean value of all users\u00e2 predicted WTP is \u03bc y = 1 N \u2211 i = 1 N y i , and the variance of all users\u2019 predicted WTP is \u03c3 y 2 = 1 N \u2211 i = 1 N ( y i \u2212 \u03bc y ) 2 . If we assume that the values that participants provide in the survey follow a normal distribution, then the probability that the answer value of user i is xi and the mean probabilities are given as follows: (2) P x i = 1 2 \u03c0 \u03c3 x 2 exp ( \u2212 ( x i \u2212 \u03bc x ) 2 2 \u03c3 x 2 ) (3) P x \u00af = 1 N \u2211 i = 1 N P x i Similarly, the probability that the predicted WTP value of user i is yi and the geometric mean probability of y are as follows: (4) P y i = 1 2 \u03c0 \u03c3 y 2 exp ( \u2212 ( y i \u2212 \u03bc y ) 2 2 \u03c3 y 2 ) (5) P y \u00af = 1 N \u2211 i = 1 N log P y i From these probabilities, we can extend the BTS score for normal distributions as follows: (6) BTS Score i = P x i \u00b7 log P x \u00af P y \u00af + \u03b1 P x \u00af \u00b7 log P y i P x \u00af . In this case, we set the parameter \u03b1 = 0.5 . In this experiment, there is no incentive design between the response result and the reward for participants, but the BTS score is useful for filtering the reliability of participants in the web survey (John et al., 2012). Consequently, we use the BTS score for filtering unreliable participants referencing (John et al., 2012). Table 2 shows the BTS score results for each elicitation mechanism in Situation 1. This is the WTP result for the commuter train reserved seat. From the table, we can see that the interval from the minimum value to the first quartile is much larger than the interval from the first quartile to the maximum value. For instance, the former is 121 times larger than the latter in the step-by-step elicitation mechanism. In the all-at-once elicitation mechanism, it is 47 times larger, and in the preference-prediction mechanism it is 3497 times larger. These results show that the higher-ranking BTS scores are concentrated in a small interval, whereas the lower-ranking BTS scores are outliers. As the participants who have lower-ranking BTS scores are likely to be unreliable participants, we analyze the differences of the answers between the higher-ranking participants and the lower-ranking participants. Table 3 shows the WTP and predicted WTP results for the higher-ranking and lower-ranking BTS score users in Situation 1. The higher-ranking BTS score users are the top 75% of users (410\u2013412 participants), and the lower-ranking BTS score users are the bottom 25% of users (137\u2013138 participants). The bottom 25% of users represent excessively high WTPs (10,000 yen, 3000 yen, and 45,000 yen, respectively, in each elicitation mechanism). In contrast, the maximum WTPs that the top 75% of users represented were 500 yen, 400 yen, and 600 yen, respectively, which seem reasonable. In addition, in the step-by-step elicitation and preference-prediction mechanisms, most participants represented their WTPs as zero. In the case of predicted WTPs, the values of the lower-ranking BTS score users tended to be higher than those of the higher-ranking BTS score users. These results show that the lower-ranking BTS score users are more unreliable than the higher-ranking BTS score users, because both their WTPs and their predicted WTPs can be irresponsible. Therefore, the top 400 BTS score participants are extracted for each elicitation mechanism, and all 1200 participants are analyzed afterwards ( n 1 = 400 , n 2 = 400 , and n 3 = 400 ). Moreover, we provide further evidence that the lower-ranking BTS score users are unreliable. Fig. 3 shows the answer length of each question in the web survey. In general, the groups whose BTS scores are high have long answers. Although the reliability of answers does not necessarily correlate with long answers, these results show that our filtering can remove participants whose answers are too short. In addition, the median answer length of the top 400 BTS score groups is stable for each preference mechanism and question setting. 4.2 Analysis of experimental results If there is no cognitive or representation cost for preference elicitation, the results of the three preference-elicitation mechanisms must show the same trend. If this is not so, then the preference-elicitation mechanism is shown to have an effect on the elicitation results. First, to clarify the effects of the preference-elicitation mechanisms, we analyze the number of representations in the three elicitation mechanisms and the three situations. Fig. 4 indicates the number of participants who represent positive valuations of each time slot. Fig. 4(a) shows the results for Situation 1. The time slot whose number of representations is the largest is the arrival time 8:30 AM. However, the overall trend is significantly different. First, the number of representations in the preference-prediction mechanism is much larger than that in the step-by-step or all-at-once elicitation. In particular, the representations in the step-by-step and all-at-once elicitation are concentrated around the most desired time slot. In contrast, the representations in the preference-prediction mechanism have a heavy tail distribution, but the form seems to consider the schedule delay cost function. Fig. 4(b) shows the results for Situation 2. The time slot whose number of representations is the largest is the arrival time around 12 h. As in Situation 1, the number of representations in the preference-prediction mechanism is much larger than that in the other elicitation mechanisms, and the distribution in the preference-prediction mechanism has a moderate peak, but the distributions in the step-by-step and all-at-once elicitation have sharp peaks. Fig. 4(c) shows the results for Situation 3, which have the same trend. The time slot whose number of representations is the largest is the departure time 7 h or 8 h, and the number of representations decreases with the coming of evening. From these results, it is concluded that the preference-prediction mechanism makes the number of representations larger and the time distribution heavier compared with the other two elicitation mechanisms. Heavy distribution is especially important for auctions because it leads to a thick market. Next, we analyze the average WTP of each time slot in the three situations. Fig. 5 shows the average WTP of each time slot in all situations. In Situation 1 (reserved commuter train seat), the distribution of the average WTP is similar to that of the number of representations. From Fig. 5(a), we can see the form of the average WTPs of each time slot and it is similar to the schedule delay cost function which is well known in transportation research such as departure choice model.In the schedule cost function, the absolute value of the slope in early arrival is smaller than that in late arrival. And the minimum schedule cost time is desired arrival time.As the WTPs are affected by the schedule cost function negatively, Fig. 5(a) shows that 8:30am is the desired arrival time and we can see the tendency of the slopes is similar to the theoretical schedule cost function. In addition, the figure shows that the time slots around the most desired time slot of the step-by-step and all-at-once elicitation mechanisms have high valuations but that the other time slots have very low WTPs, because there are few representations in those time slots. In Situation 2 (business flight), the trend of the number of representations is different from that of the WTPs. The preference-prediction mechanism has the most representations, but the all-at-once mechanism has the highest WTPs. This indicates that the participants in the all-at-once mechanism represent higher WTPs than those in the preference-prediction mechanism. Situation 3 (leisure flight) has the same tendency as Situation 2. The number of representations in the preference-prediction mechanism is larger than that in the all-at-once mechanism, but the WTP of the all-at-once mechanism is higher. These results show that the preference-elicitation mechanism has an effect on the number of representations of time slots and WTPs. In particular, the step-by-step elicitation mechanism encourages participants to represent small numbers of WTPs. Finally, Fig. 6 shows the number of representations of each participant. In the step-by-step elicitation mechanism, the average number is approximately two in all situations. In the all-at-once elicitation mechanism, the average numbers are two, four, and four. In contrast, in the preference-prediction mechanism, the average numbers are four, seven, and eight. These results show that the preference-elicitation mechanisms have an effect on the number of representations of each participant. In particular, the number of representations is decreased by the cognitive and elicitation cost of the step-by-step and all-at-once elicitation mechanisms rather than increased by the preference-prediction mechanism. The foregoing discussion clarifies the fact that the differences among the preference-elicitation mechanisms do not affect the most desired time slots. On the other hand, it has a significant impact on the representations of low WTP time slots. In particular, these are the early time slots in Situations 1 and 2 and the time slots after noon in Situation 3. In reality, these time slots do not have zero valuations, but they can have some positive valuations for participants. However, the participants did not represent their WTPs, meaning that the WTP is equal to zero, in the step-by-step and all-at-once elicitation mechanisms. In contrast, the preference-prediction mechanism increases the number of representations of these time slots, thereby creating thickness in the market. As noted above, our experiments use the RCT. Therefore, there can be no differences in the number of representations and average WTPs in the three groups. Hence, the results indicate empirically that the preference-elicitation mechanisms have a significant impact on the number of representations and WTPs. 5 Impacts of the preference elicitation mechanisms on auction results We showed that the differences among the preference-elicitation mechanisms have an effect on participants\u2019 representations and bidding behavior. In this section, we use these results to analyze the effects of the differences on the auction and allocation results. We assume that the users i\u202f\u2208\u202fI make one trip per day and that they require one time slot ticket/permit. This assumption is called the single unit demand condition, and the setting is the same as in the laboratory experiment. The set of time slots t is T, and the number of time slots is |T|. Next, the service provider, the auctioneer, aims to maximize the social welfare by allocating the service tickets/permits. Here, the social welfare W( v ) is defined as the sum of the valuations for allocated users. This definition is similar to the definition in general research on auction theory by Nisan et al. (2007) and Cramton et al. (2006). This assignment problem can be described as follows: (7) W ( v ) = max x \u2211 t \u2208 T \u2211 i \u2208 I v i ( t ) \u00b7 x i ( t ) subject to \u2211 t \u2208 T x i ( t ) \u2264 1 \u2200 i \u2208 I \u2211 i \u2208 I x i ( t ) \u2264 \u03bc \u2200 t \u2208 T x i ( t ) \u2208 { 0 , 1 } \u2200 i \u2208 I , \u2200 t \u2208 T where v i = ( v i ( 1 ) , \u2026 , v i ( t ) , \u2026 , v i ( | T | ) ) is the private valuation vector of user i, and xi (t)\u202f\u2208\u202f{0, 1} is the discrete variable that indicates as to whether or not the time slot is available for user i. We assume that the private valuation is nonnegative ( v i \u202f\u2265\u202f 0 ). The constraint conditions show that each user wants only one ticket/permit and that the sum of the allocated users in the time slot t is lower than the capacity limit \u03bc. When the auction mechanism is VCG mechanism which has useful characteristics such as strategy-proofness and efficiency, the payment of user i is called a VCG payment. It is expressed by the following equation: (8) P i ( v ) = W ( 0 , v \u2212 i ) \u2212 W \u2212 i ( v ) where v \u2212 i is the valuation vector for agents other than agent i, and W(\u202f\u00b7\u202f) is the sum of the winners\u2019 valuations, and W \u2212 i ( \u00b7 ) is the sum of the winners\u2019 valuations W(\u202f\u00b7\u202f) minus agent i\u2019s value v i . W ( 0 , v \u2212 i ) is the sum of the winners\u2019 valuations if agent i was not participating. The VCG payment is determined by the difference between W \u2212 i ( \u00b7 ) and W ( 0 , v \u2212 i ) . It means the externality of agent i\u2019s participating. Therefore, if agent i is one of winners, he/she should pay his negative externality, and otherwise, he need not pay. The VCG mechanism is the general extension of second price auction. Here, we aim to clarify the influence of the difference in elicitation mechanisms on both the social welfare and the price of each usage right, namely, the VCG payments. We set the number of usage rights in Situation 1 to five in each time slot (total people available: 100), the number of usage rights in Situation 2 to ten in each time slot (total people available: 100), and the number of usage rights in Situation 3 to eight in each time slot (total available people: 104). These settings indicate that almost one-half of the participants can use the transportation services. We obtained the probability distribution of the number of representations in each situation and each elicitation mechanism from the laboratory experiments. We sampled 200 agents from 400 participants according with the probability distribution. After that, we calculated the allocation result, social welfare, and VCG payments. We call the set of processes a resampling. To analyze the statistical properties of the impacts of the elicitation mechanisms, we did 1000 resampling and discuss the result of the social welfare and VCG payments. Fig. 7 shows the distributions of social welfare in all elicitation mechanisms and all situations with 1000 resamplings. To easily understand the differences among the elicitation mechanisms, we show the results of kernel density estimation for each distribution in the figure. First, Fig. 7(a) shows that the preference-prediction mechanism greatly improves social welfare. As shown in Fig. 6, the average number of representations in the step-by-step and all-at-once elicitation mechanisms is at most two. On the other hand, the preference-prediction mechanism increases the average number of representations to six. The effect from the increase of representations is substantial for improving the social welfare. When the number of representations is small, the representations tend to concentrate on the high-ranking time slots, and there are few representations in the low-ranking time slots, as shown in Fig. 4. Therefore, the heterogeneity between participants in the low-ranking time slots is not differentiated. On the other hand, in the preference-prediction mechanism, participants can easily represent their WTPs in many time slots and can show the structure of their scheduling cost function. This enables substantial improvement in the social welfare. In Situations 2 and 3, the social welfare of the preference-prediction mechanism is the highest among the three mechanisms, but the social welfare of the all-at-once elicitation mechanism is also high. This is because the number of representations in the all-at-once elicitation mechanism increases compared to that in Situation 1. Situation 2 involves a business trip, for which the company pays all of the travel fees. In addition, we showed the reference price of each airline. Under these settings, we can see that the heuristic in which participants represent the same WTP as the reference price in all of the time slots is likely to occur. As a result, participants represented high WTPs even for the low-ranking time slots, resulting in a large improvement in the social welfare. However, since there is a scheduling cost, this heuristic, in which participants represent the same WTP as the reference price in all of the time slots, does not occur as a bidding behavior in reality. Thus, the fact that the efficiency of auctions changes substantially owing to the combination of the situation setting, the existence of a reference price, and the elicitation mechanisms is an interesting characteristic of this laboratory experimental result. The result indicates that the preference-elicitation mechanism and the providing of information before bidding are important. Nevertheless, the preference-prediction mechanism can lead to the highest social welfare. Finally, Fig. 8 shows the average VCG payments of each time slot with 1000 result calculations. Unlike the average WTP shown in Fig. 5, the differences in the average VCG payments in all of the elicitation mechanisms are small. The important point, in particular, is that the average number of VCG payments in the preference-prediction mechanism is not substantially higher than that in the other elicitation mechanisms, even though the preference-prediction mechanism can substantially improve the social welfare. This result indicates that the preference-prediction mechanism promotes the representations of the low-ranking time slots, which are not likely to be represented in the step-by-step and all-at-once elicitation mechanisms, and it does not encourage participants to represent higher WTPs in the high-ranking time slots. Therefore, we can conclude that the preference-prediction mechanism can improve the social welfare by allocating usage rights adequately through these effects. The above results show that the difference in the elicitation mechanisms influences the efficiency of auction results. In particular, it was shown that a na\u00efve elicitation mechanism tends to decrease the number of representations in low-ranking time slots and can reduce the social welfare. The preference-prediction mechanism is useful for solving this problem, and it can improve the social welfare by allocating usage rights properly. 6 Estimation of the preference-Elicitation cost Finally, we use our experimental data to estimate users\u2019 preference-elicitation costs. The comparison between the step-by-step, all-at-once, and preference-prediction mechanisms shows that participants tend not to represent the WTP of the lower-ranking usage rights in spite of their positive valuations, and the lack of representations can lead to the reduction of the social welfare, as shown in Section 5. The reason why participants do not represent the WTPs is the existence of a preference-elicitation cost. Therefore, we clarify the structure of the preference-elicitation cost, and then we estimate the cost. Previous work on the bother cost associated with the interaction with such a system includes Fleming\u2019s bother cost model. In this study, we use this idea to create a new model. There are two main principles in Fleming\u2019s model Fleming, 2003; (Fleming and Cohen, 2004). First, recent interruptions and difficult questions are to carry more weight than interruptions in the distant past and very straightforward questions. Second, the user\u2019s willingness to interact with the system is a critical factor in bother cost modeling. Some users are very willing and would prefer to assist the system actively to achieve a better result, whereas other users are not so willing and would prefer to be bothered only minimally. However, in this study, for simplicity, we use the same utility function for all users without considering the user heterogeneity. 6.1 Utility function and preference-elicitation cost For the sake of simplicity, we consider the case of step-by-step elicitation and Situation 1 (reserved seat on a crowded commuter train) without loss of generality. The choice set is how many time slots an agent bids. If an agent bids nothing, his/her choice is 0. If he/she bids all time slots, his/her choice is 20. Therefore, the number of alternatives is 21. In this study, we focus on the number of representations rather than which time slots an agent chooses. We consider the benefit and preference-elicitation cost of an agent at the time of the kth representation because an agent need to bid a time slot sequentially in step-by-step mechanism. Designating w 1 , \u2026 , w k as the WTPs from the first representation to the kth, we describe the benefit of the kth representation as (9) b 0 \u2261 0 , (10) b k \u2261 \u03b8 ( w 1 + w 2 + \u22ef + w k ) , \u2200 k = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , 20 where \u03b8 is a parameter. This equation shows that the benefit is proportional to the sum of all previous representations. On the other hand, we assume that the preference-elicitation cost is a particular constant c, discounting time advances in the same manner as in Fleming\u2019s bother cost model. Hence, the preference-elicitation cost of the kth representation is as follows: (11) c k \u2261 c \u00b7 \u03b2 k \u2212 1 + c \u00b7 \u03b2 k \u2212 2 + \u00b7 + c \u00b7 \u03b2 + c = 1 \u2212 \u03b2 k 1 \u2212 \u03b2 c \u2200 k . From these equations, the utility function of the kth representation is (12) U i = b k \u2212 c k + \u025b i \u2200 k , where \u03b5 i follows an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) extreme value distribution. As we consider the utility function, we estimate the parameters of a logit model for the choice of the number of representations. In the case of the Situation 1 (reserved seat on a crowded commuter train), the number of alternatives is 21, that is, no representation and then k times representations ( k = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , 20 ). However, we could not observe all of the WTPs of the participants in our experiment because most of the participants stopped representing their WTPs. To tackle this problem, we must analyze the relationships among WTPs. Fig. 9 shows the relationship between the average WTP and the number of representations. The figure shows that the first representation is the highest WTP and that the WTP decreases as the number of representations increases. From the result, the WTP of the next representation is set to 0.717 times as large as the previous WTP on average. The red line in Fig. 9 shows the estimated WTP, which is found by multiplying 0.717 by the first representation. This means that if there are unobserved WTPs, we will assume that the second-highest WTP = 0.717 \u00d7 the highest WTP and the third-highest WTP = 0 . 717 2 \u00d7 the highest WTP, thereafter repeating the procedure. By comparing the two lines, we show that the estimated WTPs are good approximations of true but unobserved WTPs. Therefore, we use the relationship for interpolating unobserved WTPs of participants. 6.2 Estimation result For the parameter estimation, we normalized the first representation of WTP in the benefit term to one. Therefore, the cost parameter is estimated as a parameter relative to the normalized WTP. There are two parameters estimated in this model. The first is the cost parameter c 1, and the other is the discount factor of the cost parameter \u03b2. The estimation results are shown in Table 4 . From the estimation results, we determine that the preference-elicitation cost of each representation of WTP is 0.896 times as large as the highest WTP. This preference-elicitation cost is very large because it is almost the same as the highest WTP. Therefore, most participants stop representing their WTP in the early steps. This is the reason why the number of representations is small in the step-by-step elicitation mechanism. Finally, we discuss the cost parameter c 1 by sensitivity analysis. Fig. 10 shows the reproduced probability of the number of representations which users bid by using estimated model. Under the setting of the cost parameter c 1 = 0.896 , the alternative of maximum probability is only one representation, and the probability of one representation is almost the same as that of no representation and two representations. The result is consistent with the result in Fig. 6 because the standard deviation of representations in step-by-step mechanism is small. On the other hand, if the cost parameter c 1 = 0.2 , the probability distribution is totally different from that of c 1 = 0.896 . The alternative of maximum probability is 7 representations and the standard deviation of representations is much larger than that of the former case. We can interpret the result as the case of preference-prediction mechanism because the result is consistent with the result in Fig. 6. From the sensitivity analysis, we can understand the behavior of this model. First, as the cost parameter decreases, the number of representations increases drastically. Second, as the cost parameter decreases, the standard deviation of the number of representations increases. Third, from the experimental results and estimation results, the cost parameter of the preference-prediction mechanism is only one-fifth of that of step-by-step mechanism. It means the preference-prediction mechanism can make the preference elicitation cost small drastically. 7 Conclusion For transportation services, the mechanism design such as auction theory and matching theory have become essential because the information and communication technology has enabled us to allocate resources flexibly. However, most of previous studies are theoretical analysis and they focused only on the rational behavior of agents who do not feel a preference elicitation cost and a cognitive cost. In this study, we focused on the preference elicitation cost in representing WTPs in transportation auction services. In order to clarify the preference elicitation cost in representing WTPs, we used the laboratory experimental approach in web-based survey. By using RCT and BTS scores, we divided participants into three groups and they represented their WTPs in three different preference elicitation mechanisms such as step-by-step mechanism, all-at-once mechanism, preference-prediction mechanism. From the results, we empirically showed that valuations and the number of representations varied depending on the preference elicitation mechanism. It means that the behavioral characteristics of the agents are important in representing WTPs and preference-elicitation cost really exists. In general, the step-by-step and all-at-once elicitation mechanisms can lead to a small number of representations. The preference elicitation cost of the mechanism can be high for participants. In addition, the efficiency of auction results can decrease because of the insufficiency of representations. Our proposed preference-prediction mechanism can solve these problems, and it can improve the number of representations and the efficiency of auction results. Therefore, our results show that the mechanism design for transportation services need not only payment mechanism such as VCG mechanism but also high-quality preference elicitation mechanism. We call the mechanism design with payment mechanism and high-quality preference elicitation mechanism \u201cbehavioral mechanism design\u201d. Finally, we empirically showed that the preference-elicitation cost really exists, and we estimated the preference-elicitation cost using experimental data. The cost is almost the same as the benefit of the highest WTP alternative, indicating that the reduction of the preference-elicitation cost is significant for efficient transportation service allocation. By comparing choice probabilities of step-by-step mechanism and those of preference-prediction mechanism, we showed the preference-prediction mechanism can make the preference elicitation cost small drastically. For future work, we need to conduct further laboratory experiments and social pilot program in real world. And it is necessary to validate the efficiency of our preference elicitation mechanism by these experiments. In addition, it is important to clarify what kind of preference elicitation mechanism is useful for what kind of transportation services.
