"Transportation Research Part B: MethodologicalMulti-train trajectory optimization for energy efficiency and delay recovery on single-track railway linesAbstract This paper proposes a novel multi-train trajectory optimization for single-track lines. We restrict our attention to delay cases aiming at finding optimal speed profiles, which reduce delays and save energy consumption. A multi-train trajectory optimization method is proposed to find optimal meeting locations, arrival/departure times, and speed trajectories of multiple trains within the time and speed windows. The proposed method first finds timetable constraint sets for trains under delayed situations. The timetable constraint sets provide drivable, feasible, and energy-efficient time and speed windows along the trains\u2019 routes. The multi-train trajectory optimization method uses minimizing energy consumption and reducing delays as the objective functions, and takes into account each train\u2019s operational constraints as well as constraints to avoid conflicts between adjacent trains. Three driving strategies of delay-recovery, energy-efficient and on-time driving, are proposed and combined in the optimization objective selection for different delay scenarios. The multi-train trajectory optimization is formulated as a multiple-phase optimal control problem and solved by a pseudospectral method. The proposed method is applied in case studies of opposite trains running on a Dutch single-track railway corridor with different initial delay scenarios. The results show that our method is able to produce a feasible schedule with energy-efficient speed trajectories for all interacting trains.serial JL 271728 291210 291772 291817 31 Transportation Research Part B: Methodological TRANSPORTATIONRESEARCHPARTBMETHODOLOGICAL 2017-10-10 2017-10-10 2017-10-10 2017-10-10 2018-09-25T17:03:18 1-s2.0-S0191261517300711 S0191-2615(17)30071-1 S0191261517300711 10.1016/j.trb.2017.09.012 S300 S300.3 FULL-TEXT 1-s2.0-S0191261517X00088 2018-09-25T19:52:36.017797Z 0 0 20171101 20171130 2017 2017-10-10T12:35:47.887859Z articleinfo articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright crossmark dateloaded dateloadedtxt datesearch datesort dateupdated dco docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid indexeddate issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdateend pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sectiontitle sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype ssids alllist content subj subheadings suppl tomb volfirst volissue volumelist webpdf webpdfpagecount yearnav figure table body mmlmath affil articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authkeywords authlast highlightsabst primabst ref 0191-2615 01912615 true 105 105 C Volume 105 18 340 361 340 361 201711 November 2017 2017-11-01 2017-11-30 2017 Research papers article fla \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract This paper proposes a novel multi-train trajectory optimization for single-track lines. We restrict our attention to delay cases aiming at finding optimal speed profiles, which reduce delays and save energy consumption. A multi-train trajectory optimization method is proposed to find optimal meeting locations, arrival/departure times, and speed trajectories of multiple trains within the time and speed windows. The proposed method first finds timetable constraint sets for trains under delayed situations. The timetable constraint sets provide drivable, feasible, and energy-efficient time and speed windows along the trains\u2019 routes. The multi-train trajectory optimization method uses minimizing energy consumption and reducing delays as the objective functions, and takes into account each train\u2019s operational constraints as well as constraints to avoid conflicts between adjacent trains. Three driving strategies of delay-recovery, energy-efficient and on-time driving, are proposed and combined in the optimization objective selection for different delay scenarios. The multi-train trajectory optimization is formulated as a multiple-phase optimal control problem and solved by a pseudospectral method. The proposed method is applied in case studies of opposite trains running on a Dutch single-track railway corridor with different initial delay scenarios. The results show that our method is able to produce a feasible schedule with energy-efficient speed trajectories for all interacting trains. Keywords Train trajectory optimization Delay recovery Single-track lines 1 Introduction Delays affect the performance of railway networks and the quality of service provided to passengers and shippers. When delays occur, drivers are responsible for getting the delayed trains back to the original or rescheduled timetable. The process of getting delayed trains back to schedule is called delay recovery. It is more energy-efficient to recover the delay gradually over several legs of the journey than to recover quickly (Albrecht et al., 2015). However, the delayed train will often interact with other trains, causing a further delay propagation through the system and thereby impacting the energy-efficiency of many trains. In particular, on single-track lines, trains have limited possibility of meeting and overtaking. Trains cannot enter the single-track lines that are occupied by opposite trains, and trains in the same directions must follow each other\u2019s path sequentially, until an overtaking or passing track is reached at stations or sometimes at loops. Those limitations increase the possibility of delay propagation. Therefore, even the experienced drivers find it hard to achieve an efficient train operation once the train is delayed or affected by delayed trains on the single-track lines. To improve the performances of train drivers, train driver advisory systems (DAS) are proposed, which provide train drivers with information and driving advice and helps them to drive the train in an efficient manner. A DAS needs an optimal train trajectory (speed-distance curve and time-distance curve along the train\u2019s journey), based on which driving advice is computed accordingly. The train trajectory optimization (TTO) problem is to find the optimal trajectory by optimal control theory. Generally, the optimization aims at minimising the energy consumption and maintaining the timetable, with consideration of the constraints of train characteristics, track gradients, curves and speed limits. In the last few decades, TTO has drawn a lot of attention in the literature. Wang et al. (2011), Albrecht et al. (2016a), and Scheepmaker et al. (2017) provide comprehensive surveys from different views. Wang et al. (2011) reviewed the numerical approaches for solving the train trajectory optimization problem. Albrecht et al. (2016a) focused on the state-of-the-art of using Pontryagin\u2019s Maximum Principle (PMP) to find the key principles of optimal train control. Scheepmaker et al. (2017) provided surveys on the energy-efficient train control and energy-efficient train timetable problems. The solution methods of the TTO problem can be divided into two categories: indirect methods and direct methods (Wang et al., 2011). PMP is a typical indirect method, which has been successfully used in train trajectory optimization (Albrecht et al., 2016a). With the application of PMP, the TTO problem is converted to a problem of finding the optimal sequence of optimal control regimes (maximum power, cruising, coasting, and maximum braking) and the switching points between the regimes for a range of different circumstances and train types. Finding the optimal sequence and switching points is a difficult problem except for simple cases such as a single speed limit and flat track (Albrecht et al., 2016b). Direct methods were developed more recently and expanded quickly because of their advantages over indirect methods (Scheepmaker et al., 2017). Direct methods transcribe a optimal control problem to a nonlinear programming problem (NLP), which is then solved by existing NLP solvers. For instance, pseudospectral methods have been successful applied by Wang et al. (2013), Wang and Goverde (2016a) and Ye and Liu (2016) in solving the TTO problem. Under delay circumstances, the interactions from neighboring trains cannot be ignored, which have drawn attention recently. Some researches reflect the interactions as dynamic speed limits on train movements imposed by signaling systems. Albrecht (2009) considered the driving strategies to move a train through conflict areas. The target was to slow down the train before critical conflicts (red signals) and then pass critical infrastructure elements with shortest possible delay, in this way, reducing energy costs and avoiding unscheduled stops. Three driving strategies \u2013 reactive driving, optimal anticipating driving, and safe anticipating driving \u2013 were proposed to achieve this target. Yun et al. (2011) provided solutions to identify the optimal approaching speed for the optimal anticipating driving strategy. The optimal speed enables the train to leave the conflict area as soon as possible. A heuristic method was then developed to attain the optimal speed trajectory. Wang and Goverde (2016a) focused on the single-train trajectory optimization problem with consideration of dynamic speed limits imposed by the signalling system. Two different driving strategies, a signal response policy and green wave policy, were developed to respond to signals and to avoid yellow signals. The signal response policy refers to actively adjusting the train speed according to the signal aspects. A green wave policy means anticipating to slow down the train in front of a conflicting area to make the train face only green signal aspects. A different green wave policy was first proposed in Corman et al. (2009), in which the green wave policy allows trains to wait only at their scheduled stops. Wang and Goverde (2016a) extended the green wave policy by allowing regulating speeds and running times for more efficient driving. The case studies in Wang and Goverde (2016a) show that a green wave policy saves more energy consumption than the signal response policy. Other researchers optimize multi-train trajectories together with consideration of the interactions between neighboring trains. Albrecht et al. (2011) provided a numerical algorithm to find interaction times that allows each affected train to finish on time wherever possible and minimises total energy consumption for the whole set of trains. The interaction times can be transmitted to DASs on each of the trains (trajectory optimization modules), which will set strategies to meet these times. Further work is required to extend to situations where interaction locations and sequences may change. Yang et al. (2012) provided a mathematical model for multiple trains on a railway network. The model aims at minimizing total energy consumption and running times of all trains, while satisfying the constraints to ensure the feasibility of multi-train operations, which include headway constraints, vehicle speed limit constraints, passenger riding comfort constraints, and dwell time constraints. The control strategies of every involved train are the decision variables of the multi-train model. A genetic algorithm (GA) integrated with simulation was designed to find the optimal control strategies. Zhao et al. (2015) studied the trajectory optimization problem of multi-trains, considering the trade-off between reduction in train energy usage against increases in delay. The research focused on following trains with a fixed block signaling system in a delayed situation. A multi-train simulator and three searching methods, namely, enhanced brute force, ant colony optimization, and a genetic algorithm, were adopted to find the optimal trajectories. A case study of four following trains showed that the algorithm is able to reduce energy consumption and interactions between trains. However, the three searching methods cost long computation times to find optimal solutions, which needs future improvement for real-time application. Yin et al. (2016); 2017) addressed the train schedule and reschedule problem with dynamic passenger demands, with consideration of multiple trains\u2019 energy-efficient speed profiles. Wang and Goverde (2016c) studied the delay recovery problem of the two successive trains in the same direction. A two-train trajectory optimization method was developed to compute two trains\u2019 trajectories simultaneously, which takes into account not only each train\u2019s operational constraints, but also the constraints on keeping safe distances between the two trains. The green wave policy was adopted to ensure that the trains run safely under all green signals to avoid frequent stop/start behavior and thus improving train operation efficiency. Summing up past research on trajectory optimization under delay circumstances, most of the previous studies focus on trains in the same direction. Certain headways between trains are necessary to avoid conflicts, while the energy efficiency relies on how do the trains pass through conflict areas (yellow and red signals). Nevertheless, the trajectory optimization for a train on single-track lines is more complex, because the train has additional restrictions of meeting and overtaking. Opposite trains cannot occupy a single-track section at the same time. In practice, the dispatching process is first used to determine optimal orders and meet-pass plans, after which drivers adjust the train speed to follow the new plan. Cacchiani et al. (2014) provided a review of recovery models and algorithms for real-time rescheduling. As for the single-track railway scheduling problem, one of the first researches started in the1970\u2032s, with the work by Szpigel (1973). Szpigel (1973) developed a linear programming model to determine the best meeting and overtaking positions and used a branch and bound method to resolve the conflicts. Minimising the sum of the travel times was the objective and only small problems were tested. Jovanovi\u0107 and Harker (1991) introduced the Schedule Analysis System (SCAN), which deals with scheduling problems on single and double track segments. It is based on a compound method of optimization and simulation. Higgins et al. (1996) gave a mathematical programming model to schedule trains over a single line track. The objective function is to minimize a combination of delays and energy consumption. The priority of each train in a conflict depends on an estimate of the remaining crossing and overtaking delay, as well as the current delay. This priority is used in a branch and bound procedure to allow an optimal solution to reasonable size train scheduling problems to be determined efficiently. Meng and Zhou (2011) provided a dispatching model for a major service disruption on single-track lines. The model incorporates different probabilistic scenarios in the rolling horizon decision process. A multi-layer branching solution procedure was developed to generate and select meet-pass plans under different stochastic scenarios. Umiliacchi et al. (2016) introduced a simulation-based method that minimizes the effects of a single delay on the journeys of two trains and on the trains\u2019 energy consumption while satisfying time constraints on a single-track railway line. It can be seen that the aim of rescheduling on single-track lines is to determine where trains will meet and pass to minimize train delays or deviations from the planned schedule while satisfying a set of operational constraints. The train movement process (train trajectory) is rarely taken into account during the dispatching process, which results in two major shortcomings: first, the way of driving a train may influence the decision to be made during the dispatching process. Second, the delays of a train after an initial delay are different for different driving strategy. A bad delay estimation may result in a bad prediction of future conflicts. D\u2019Ariano et al. (2007), Mazzarello and Ottaviani (2007), Luthi (2009) and Caimi et al. (2011) proposed approaches for anticipating driving in the dispatching process, and showed that those approaches contribute to further decreasing delays and increasing energy efficiency. Recognizing that limited attention has been devoted to the anticipating driving in the dispatching process especially on single-track lines, this research restricts attention to opposite trains on a single-track line which meet at multiple-track stations, and aims to find a feasible meet plan and energy-efficient speed profiles for opposite trains under delayed conditions. It is assumed that trains in the same direction do not overtake, and the delays are relatively small so that the cancelation of trains in the timetable is not necessary, but the meet locations and the train sequences may change. The work is developed on the train trajectory optimization level. It firstly aims at finding feasible time windows at stations, which delayed trains are able to go through. The time windows and corresponding speed windows are formulated as timetable constraint sets (TCSs). Then a multi-train trajectory optimization (MTTO) method is developed to find trains\u2019 trajectories within the TCSs. The MTTO model takes into account not only every single train\u2019s constraints of dynamic movement equations, vehicle parameters, and varying speed limits and gradients, but also constraints to avoid conflicts between following trains and opposite trains. The MTTO method can calculate speed profiles for multiple trains simultaneously, and choose proper meeting locations for opposite trains for the benefit of reducing delays and energy costs. The MTTO is formulated as a multiple-phase optimal control problem (Rao, 2003). The multiple-phase optimal control problem formulation has been used first in Wang et al. (2015) and Wang and Goverde (2016a) for single-train trajectory optimization, in Wang and Goverde (2016c) for two following trains in the same direction, and then in Wang and Goverde (2016b) to two opposite trains on single-track lines. The multiple-phase optimal control problem has the advantage of accurately incorporating varying gradients, curves and speed limits, timetable constraints, and railway network topology. This work is an extension of Wang and Goverde (2016b), which dealt with two punctual opposite trains. This paper discusses the case of train trajectory optimization after a delay occurs. Compared with Wang and Goverde (2016b), the present paper has two improvements: (1) we relax the assumption that the train sequencing within single-track segments is fixed which works for on-time trains, but not for delayed conditions. So the formulation in this paper allows changing the train orders to the open tracks. And (2), we relax the assumption of equal lengths of parallel station tracks and thus consider different lengths of station tracks, which provides a more accurate model for multiple-track stations and for train trajectory calculation. The multiple-phase optimal control problem is solved efficiently by a pseudospectral method (Rao et al., 2010), which transforms the problem into a nonlinear programming model that is solved by an nonlinear programming solver. The MTTO model has two objectives: minimizing delays and saving energy consumption. The priorities of the two objectives are different under different circumstances. In order to select proper optimization objectives, three different driving strategies \u2013 the delay-recovery strategy, energy-saving strategy and on-time strategy \u2013 are proposed. A driving strategy selection algorithm is developed in order to find the best driving strategy for each running section (The running section refers to a train route between two stops.). The proposed method is demonstrated by application to case studies of opposite-trains running on a Dutch partially single-track railway corridor with different initial delay scenarios. The results show that our method is able to produce optimal timetables and speed profiles of opposite trains simultaneously. The meeting locations and times are chosen during the optimization process automatically where energy-efficient and conflict-free driving as well as delay recovery requirements are considered. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a description of optimization objectives and operational constraints of train movements. Section 3 introduces the timetable constraint set formulation in case of delays. Section 4 formulates the multi-train trajectory optimization as a multiple-phase optimal control problem, and presents three driving strategies and a corresponding driving strategy selection algorithm. Section 5 illustrates the proposed approach in case studies. Finally Section 6 ends the paper with conclusions. 2 Problem description A single-track railway line consists of a single-track line with intermediate multiple-track stations where trains can meet and overtake, see Fig. 1 . Consider a single-track corridor between kilometer point K 0 and Kf (K 0\u202f<\u202fKf ). The stations in the direction from K 0 to Kf are named with successive numbers 1 , 2 , \u2026 , Z . Denote by Z = { 1 , 2 , \u2026 , Z } the set of stations where Z is the number of stations between K 0 and Kf . Denote by I the set of trains operating on this corridor, I d the set of trains in the downstream direction from station 1 to Z and I u the set of trains in the upstream direction from station Z to 1, and Z i the stations on train i \u2208 I \u2019s journey. For a train i \u2208 I , it is requested by the timetable to arrive at and depart from stations on specific times. Moreover, the passing-through times at non-stop stations should stay within specific time windows to avoid influences on other trains. For a mathematical description, classify a train\u2019s event at a station into three types: arrival, departure and pass-through. Denote by e an event e\u202f\u2208\u202f{a, d, p}, where a refers to arrival, d refers to departure, and p refers to pass-through. For train i \u2208 I , the timetable constraint set (TCS) is written as (1) TCS i = { ( k i , z , e , [ t i , z , e min , t i , z , e max ] , [ v i , z , e min , v i , z , e max ] ) } z \u2208 Z i , where k i, z, e is the location for train i at station z of event e, and t i , z , e min , t i , z , e max , v i , z , e min and v i , z , e max are respectively the lower and upper bounds of time and speed for e at k i, z, e . Define K TCS i as the set of timetable points of train i. If k i, z, e is a stop station, the speed window [ v i , z , e min , v i , z , e max ] = [ 0 , 0 ] , and k i , z , a = k i , z , d . Let distance be the independent variable because gradients and speed limits occur as functions of distance rather than of time. For train i \u2208 I , the generic equations of train motion can be written as follows: (2) { d v i ( s i ) d s i = \u03b8 1 f i ( s i ) \u2212 \u03b8 2 b i ( s i ) \u2212 R t r a i n , i ( v i ) \u2212 R l i n e , i ( s i ) \u03c1 i \u00b7 m i \u00b7 v i ( s i ) , d t i ( s i ) d s i = 1 v i ( s i ) , subject to (3) { 0 \u2264 f i ( s i ) \u2264 F i max , 0 \u2264 b i ( s i ) \u2264 B i max , 0 \u2264 f i ( s i ) \u00b7 v i ( s i ) \u2264 P i max , 0 \u2264 v i ( s i ) \u2264 V i max ( s i ) , A i min \u2264 d v i ( s i ) d t i ( s i ) \u2264 A i max , (4) { v i , z , e min \u2264 v i ( k i , z , e ) \u2264 v i , z , e max , t i , z , e min \u2264 t i ( k i , z , e ) \u2264 t i , z , e max , \u2200 z \u2208 Z i , k i , z , e \u2208 K TCS i , (5) D i , z min \u2264 t i ( k i , z , d ) \u2212 t i ( k i , z , a ) \u2264 D i , z max , \u2200 z \u2208 Z i , k i , z , a , k i , z , d \u2208 K TCS i . Eq. (2) present the dynamic equations of train i, where si is the traversed distance [m], vi (\u202f\u00b7\u202f) is the train velocity [m/s], \u03c1i is the rotating mass factor, mi is the train mass [t], fi (\u202f\u00b7\u202f) is the traction force [kN], bi (\u202f\u00b7\u202f) is the braking force [kN], R t r a i n , i ( v i ) = \u03b1 i + \u03b2 i \u00b7 v i + \u03b3 i \u00b7 v i 2 is the train resistance force [kN] with coefficients \u03b1i, \u03b2i and \u03b3i, R line, i (si ) is the line resistance force [kN], which is a function of position and consists of grade resistance and curve resistance, ti (\u202f\u00b7\u202f) is the traversed time [s], and \u03b8 1, \u03b8 2\u202f\u2208\u202f{0, 1} are two binary parameters with \u03b8 1 \u00b7 \u03b8 2 = 0 . In Eq. (3) are the path constraints of train i\u2019s vehicle performance characteristics, speed limits and riding-comfort. F i max , B i max and P i max are the maximum traction force, maximum braking force and maximum traction power of train i. V i max ( s i ) is the speed limit at position si , including static and temporary speed restrictions. A i min and A i max are the lower and upper bound of acceptable accelerations. Inequalities (4) are the TCS constraints which represent time and speed constraints of every timetable point in K TCS i . Inequality (5) is the dwell time constraint of train i at every stop station, where D i , z min and D i , z max are respectively the minimum and maximum dwell times. In case a delay occurs, the train driver must get the delayed train back to the pre-defined timetable. The train trajectory optimization problem is to find a series of control laws for the train traction and braking forces and an optimal speed profile, which reduce delays as well as minimize the energy consumption, to guide drivers in train control. The train trajectory optimization problem for a single train i \u2208 I can be formulated with a cost function (6) min J i = \u03c9 i \u00b7 t i ( K i f ) + \u222b K i 0 K i f f i ( s i ) d s i , subject to dynamic constraints (2), path constraints (3), TCS constraints (4), and dwell time constraints (5). The cost function (6) and constraints (2)\u2013(5) constitute a single-train trajectory optimization (STTO) model for a train i. In Eq. (6), K i 0 and K i f are respectively the start and end positions of train i\u2019s journey between K 0 and Kf , t i ( K i f ) is the traveled time at K i f , and \u03c9i is a weight factor. The first item in Eq. (6) aims at reducing total running time, which in turn reduces delays with the scheduled arrival time as the lower bound of the time window at K i f (see Section 4). The second term aims at saving energy consumption. The weight \u03c9i reflects the trade-off between the two objectives of delay recovery and energy efficiency. If \u03c9 i = 0 then Ji is used for energy-efficient driving. In case train i runs on schedule, the TCS time constraints at stop stations are the scheduled arrival and departure time targets, while the time windows at non-stop stations equal the scheduled passing-through time windows. The STTO model focuses on reducing energy consumptions with \u03c9 i = 0 . However, the delay circumstances are different. First, the TCS cannot be set according to the schedule times, because the train movement has deviated from its time plan and the scheduled TCS may be not feasible. The method of computing the TCS for delay cases is presented in Section 3. Second, the first priority of a delayed train is to recover from delays instead of to reduce energy consumption. Energy-efficient driving is possible in case the train has got back to the schedule, or in case the train is waiting for another train. Last but not least, a delayed train may impact other trains, causing conflicts and delay propagation. It is necessary to avoid conflicts and reduce delay propagation. In order to avoid conflicts, three more constraints should be noticed: (1) a time interval between every two adjacent trains in the same direction is required for safe train separation (Fig. 2 \u2460 ), (2) for opposite trains, there are two important types of headway requirements: (i) \u201cdepart-arrive\u201d headway, the headway between the departure of a train and the arrival of an opposing train from the same line (Fig. 2 \u2461 ); and (ii) \u201carrive-depart\u201d headway, the headway between the arrival of a train and the departure of an opposing train towards the same line (Fig. 2 \u2462 ), and (3) opposite trains cannot travel on a single-track section between two adjacent stations at the same time, otherwise a head-on conflict occurs (Fig. 2 \u2463 ). Define the train sets I o = { ( i , j ) | i and j are from opposite directions, i , j \u2208 I } and I s = { ( i , j ) | i and j are in the same direction, i , j \u2208 I } . Denote by Signal i , j the set of signals on both train i and j\u2019s journeys for i , j \u2208 I s , StationSignal i , j the set of signals at station boundaries on both train i and j\u2019s journeys for i , j \u2208 I o , [l 0, lf ] a piece of single track (l 0 and lf are the start and end locations), which opposite trains are allowed to use, and SingleTrack i , j the set of single-tracks on both train i and j\u2019s journeys for i , j \u2208 I o . The three constraints are formulated as: (7) { ( t i ( q ) \u2212 t j ( q ) ) 2 \u2265 h s 2 , \u2200 ( i , j ) \u2208 I s , q \u2208 Signal i , j , ( t i ( q ) \u2212 t j ( q ) ) 2 \u2265 h o 2 , \u2200 ( i , j ) \u2208 I o , q \u2208 StationSignal i , j , ( t i ( l 0 ) \u2212 t j ( l 0 ) ) ( t i ( l f ) \u2212 t j ( l f ) ) \u2265 \u03c3 , \u2200 ( i , j ) \u2208 I o , [ l 0 , l f ] \u2208 SingleTrack i , j . In the above, ti (q) and tj (q) refer to the time of train i and j passing through signal q. ti (l 0), ti (lf ), tj (l 0) and tj (lf ) refer to the time of train i and j passing through l 0 and lf. hs is the minimal headway time between two successive trains in the same direction. ho is the minimum \u201carrive-depart\u201d or \u201cdepart-arrive\u201d headway time. \u03c3 is a positive value close to 0 representing a safe margin for train separation. The first inequality represents the safe following headway constraint for trains in the same direction. The second inequality is for safe \u201carrive-depart\u201d or \u201cdepart-arrive\u201d headway constraints. The point where the headway time applies is usually the station but we put the headway times at signals, which are at station boundaries, to simplify the formulation. The left hand sides of the two inequalities are squared to include the influence of train sequences. The third inequality in (7) is used to avoid any crossover of two trains\u2019 time-distance paths on single-track segments. Constraints (7) should been taken into account to avoid conflicts between trains, especially in case a delay occurs. However, the constraints cannot be easily included in the STTO model presented above (minimize (6) subject to (2)\u2013(5)) since the STTO method only focuses on one train movement. Therefore, we propose a multi-train trajectory optimization (MTTO) model by optimizing multi-trains\u2019 trajectories simultaneously. The MTTO model is introduced in Section 4. 3 TCS computation This section presents the method of computing TCSs for delayed or delay-affected trains. In case a delay occurs, the delayed or delay-affected trains might not be able to arrive at or depart from stations on time. In other words, there are no feasible trajectories within the scheduled TCSs. Therefore, specific TCSs for delayed or delay-affected trains are required. The TCS indicates the time and speed window constraints at every timetable point along a train\u2019s route. For each timetable point, speed information is optional. Only some crucial positions need speed restrictions to assure the speed limits or operational constraints such as minimum speeds before slopes or tunnels. A typical example of a speed restriction is for stop points where the speed window is [0, 0], meaning that the train should stop. Time window constraints are mandatory. The time windows for delayed or delay-affected trains in this paper are designed based on three principles: drivability, feasibility, and energy efficiency. Drivability means that the time windows are reachable with minimal technical running (dwell) times and maximal advisable running (dwell) times. Feasibility means that the time windows allow conflict-free train movements. For trains in the same direction, adjacent trains\u2019 time windows should provide enough headway. For trains in opposite directions, the time windows should allow opposite trains to meet at stations. Energy efficiency means the time windows contain enough time supplements for energy-efficient driving. The time window computation follows three steps: Step 1: calculate a drivable time envelope for every train separately; Step 2: adjust time windows for feasibility; and Step 3: adjust time windows to improve energy efficiency. The first step is to calculate a drivable time envelope for every train separately. The time windows at each station are computed one by one in the train\u2019s traveling direction with (8) t i , y , a min = t i , z , d min + R i , z min , t i , y , a max = t i , z , d max + R i , z max , (9) t i , y , d min = max { t i , y , a min + D i , y min , S i , y , d } , t i , y , d max = max { t i , y , a max + D i , y max , S i , y , d } , where i \u2208 I , z \u2208 Z i , y is the next station after z on train i\u2019s route. For i \u2208 I d , z\u202f\u2260\u202fZ, y = z + 1 . For i \u2208 I u , z\u202f\u2260\u202f1, y = z \u2212 1 . R i , z min and R i , z max are the minimal and maximal running times of train i from station z to y, and D i , y min and D i , y max are the minimal and maximal dwell times of train i at station y. S i, y, e is the scheduled time for event e of train i at station y, e\u202f\u2208\u202f{a, d, p}. For simplification, we consider the passing through event as a special case of a stop, where the dwell time equals 0, t i , y , p min = t i , y , a min = t i , y , d min , and t i , y , p max = t i , y , a max = t i , y , d max . Eq. (9) avoid departures earlier than scheduled otherwise the passengers would miss the train. An example of a single train\u2019s TCS is shown in Fig. 3 (a). The drivable time region is between the two dashed lines, where the train has the chance to get back to schedule (because the minimal running times are smaller than the scheduled running times) and also has enough supplements in case that the train gets delays (because maximal running times are bigger than the scheduled ones). The second step is the TCS adjustment for feasibility. The time windows calculated in Step 1 can not guarantee feasible solutions. Take Fig. 3(b) for instance, the overlap part of drivable regions of the two trains is the potential meeting region of the two opposite trains. The overlap region must include at least one multiple-track station, otherwise the two trains can only meet at single-track segments, which leads to a head-on conflict, as the dashed area in Fig. 3(b). In Fig. 3(c), the previous train is delayed so that the headway between the two trains is not sufficient, even if the preceding train goes with minimal running (dwell) times and the following train takes maximal running (dwell) times. Step 2 is executed to adjust the time windows computed by Step 1 to avoid such potential conflicting meeting and following. First, Step 2 detects whether the headway between adjacent following trains are enough or not. For train i , j \u2208 I s , i is a preceding train, and j is a following train. If t j , z , e max \u2212 t i , z , e min < H i , j , z min , then (10) t j , z , a min = t i , z , a min + H i , j , z min , t j , z , a max = max { t j , z , a min + W , t j , z , a max } , (11) t j , z , d min = max { t i , z , d min + H i , j , z min , S j , z , d } , t j , z , d max = max { t j , z , d min + W , t j , z , d max } , where z \u2208 Z i \u2229 Z j , H i , j , z min refers to the minimal headway time from i to j at station z, and W makes sure t j , z , a max > t j , z , a min , W\u202f>\u202f0. Second, Step 2 detects potential conflicting meetings by checking the overlap regions of opposite trains. If there are potential meeting conflicts, then we enlarge the upper bounds of time windows of conflicting trains by (12) t j , z , e max = \u03b1 \u00d7 t j , z , e max , z \u2208 Z i \u2229 Z j , e \u2208 { a , d , p } , where j is a conflict train, \u03b1\u202f>\u202f1. \u03b1 should be large enough to eliminate conflicting meetings. The results of Step 2 processing the time windows in Fig. 3(b) and (c) are presented in Fig. 3(d) and (e) respectively. In Fig. 3(d), the potential meeting area of the two opposite trains includes at least one multiple-track station. In Fig. 3(e), the lower bounds and upper bounds of the following train are extended so that it is possible to keep safe headway between the two trains. The third step is to adjust the time windows for energy-efficiency. The time windows calculated in Step 1 and 2 allow early arrivals which is not beneficial for saving energy consumption. But a train may be suggested to arrive earlier than its scheduled time at potential meeting stations, so that an opposite delayed train can enter the single-track section just released by the early arriving train as soon as possible. In other cases it is unnecessary to arrive earlier than scheduled. Instead it is better to make full use of running times and coast more for energy saving purpose. Therefore Step 3 is executed to adjust lower bounds of arrival time windows to avoid unnecessary early arrivals with (13) t i , z , a min = max { t i , z , a min , S i , z , a } , t i , z , a max = max { t i , z , a max , S i , z , a } , \u2200 i \u2208 I , z \u2208 Z i , z \u2209 N i , where N i is the set of potential meeting stations of train i \u2208 I . 4 Multi-train trajectory optimization The main idea behind the multi-train trajectory optimization is to minimize the total delay and energy consumption of multiple trains, with consideration of each train\u2019s operational constraints (dynamic movement constraints, vehicle characteristic constraints, speed limits, riding comfort, TCS constraints and dwell time constraints) and the constraints to avoid conflict between trains. The MTTO is formulated as a multiple-phase optimal control problem (Rao, 2003), and constructed by the following steps: multiple-phase division, independent variable unification, track length normalization, and multiple-phase optimal control problem formulation. In the following, each step is introduced in detail. 4.1 Multiple-phase division The multiple-phase division step partitions the single-track corridor into multiple segments, in order to characterize the varying speed limits and time (and speed) constraints at timetable points and signals. The division points are one of three types: 1. Critical points of speed limits and gradients. The values of speed limits and gradients change along the track. It is assumed that the speed limits and gradients are piecewise constant functions. The points of changing speed limits or gradients are adopted to partition the whole corridor, so that each interval has a unique speed limit and gradient value. 2. Timetable points that have time or speed limitations indicated by the timetable. 3. Signal positions in both directions. The signaling system consists of a series of railway signals that divide a railway line into a series of blocks, which are important elements in managing train movements. Each block can only be occupied by one train at a time. Fig. 4 gives an illustration, where the single-track corridor is divided into 16 segments. The segment between any two adjacent division-points is a phase of the multiple-phase optimal control problem. Within each phase, the gradient and speed limit are constant, and the boundary points might be timetable points or signals, where time and/or speed restrictions apply on the train operations. 4.2 Independent variable unification The STTO model presented in Section 2 takes train i\u2019s traversed distance as the independent variable because gradients and speed limits occur as functions of distance rather than of time (Eq. (2)). The proposed MTTO model also uses trains\u2019 traversed distances as the independent variables in order to characterize every single train\u2019s dynamic movement constraints. However different trains\u2019 traversed distances are not the same since they are in different directions or follow different routes. However, the MTTO model needs a unified independent variable to formulate multi-train movements together. This paper let distance s be the independent variable of the MTTO model, which increases in the downstream direction. Let d s i = d s , d s j = \u2212 d s , \u2200 i \u2208 I d , j \u2208 I u . d s j = \u2212 d s because train j is in the upstream direction, sj decreases in the downstream direction. 4.3 Track length normalization A train route is composed of a sequence of station sections and line sections. Here \u201cstation section\u201d refers to a sequence of connected blocks within a single station starting and ending at so-called station boundaries, and \u201cline section\u201d refers to a sequence of connected blocks within a single-track or double-track line, as the examples shown in Fig. 5 . In practice, trains are assigned different routes, and the lengths of different station sections within a station might be different. The length differences make the multi-train trajectory optimization problem more complicated. A normalization parameter vector \u03bb i ( i \u2208 I ) is adopted to normalize section lengths. The normalization follows 3 steps. First, define station boundaries to divide the single-track corridor into two types, station regions and line regions. Generally, the station regions are the areas with parallel phases. For instance, station z + 1 in Fig. 4 contains phases 11\u201312 and 13\u201314. The line regions in this paper are single-track sections. For a train i \u2208 I , denote by Stationsec i z the station section that train i uses at station z \u2208 Z i , and by Linesec i z , z + 1 the line section on train i \u2208 I \u2019s route between station z and z + 1 ( z , z + 1 \u2208 Z i ). Second, define a main route in the downstream direction. The main route covers the whole corridor, and the kilometer points of the main route are continuous and increases in the downstream direction. Denote by Stationsec main z the station section on the main route at station z \u2208 Z , and by Linesec main z , z + 1 refers to the line section within the main route between station z and z + 1 ( z , z + 1 \u2208 Z ). Last but not least, a normalization parameter vector \u03bb i = { \u03bb Stationsec i z , \u03bb Linesec i z , z + 1 , \u03bb Stationsec i z + 1 , \u03bb Linesec i z + 1 , z + 2 , \u2026 } ( i \u2208 I ) is used to scale train routes with respect to the reference \u2018main route\u2019. The value of the normalization parameter at different station sections and line sections are different. For a station section in train i \u2208 I \u2019s route at station z \u2208 Z i , (14) \u03bb Stationsec i z = L Stationsec i z L Stationsec main z , \u2200 i \u2208 I , z \u2208 Z i , where L Stationsec i z and L Stationsec main z are respectively the lengths of Stationsec i z and Stationsec main z . For a line section on train i \u2208 I \u2019s route between adjacent stations z and z + 1 ( z , z + 1 \u2208 Z i ), (15) \u03bb Linesec i z , z + 1 = L Linesec i z , z + 1 L Linesec main z , z + 1 , \u2200 i \u2208 I , z , z + 1 \u2208 Z i , where L Linesec i z , z + 1 and L Linesec main z , z + 1 are respectively the lengths of Linesec i z , z + 1 and Linesec main z , z + 1 . \u03bb i is used in the formulation of cost function and dynamic constraints of the MTTO model to scale the section lengths. The section lengths will be re-scaled again in the final solution for each train, so that the computed trajectories respect the actual route lengths. 4.4 Multiple-phase optimal control problem formulation A multiple-phase optimal control problem is one where the trajectory consists of a collection of phases (Rao, 2003). In general, any particular phase has a cost function, a dynamic model, path constraints, boundary conditions, and event constraints. But it is not mandatory. The complete trajectory is obtained by properly linking adjacent phases via linkage conditions. Similarly, the total cost functional is the sum of the cost functionals within each phase. The optimal trajectory is then found by minimizing the total cost functional subject to the constraints within each phase and the linkage constraints connecting adjacent phases. In the following, we describe the details of the multiple-phase optimal control problem formulation of the MTTO model. Notations: Notations 1 r: a phase r \u2208 R , R = { 1 , \u2026 , R } , R is the total number of phases; s 0 ( r ) , s f ( r ) : the initial and terminal location of phase r, s 0 ( r ) < s f ( r ) ; A : the set of adjacent phases, A = { ( m , n ) | s f ( m ) = s 0 ( n ) , m , n \u2208 R } ; I ( r ) : the set of trains passing through phase r, I ( r ) \u2286 I , train i \u2208 I ( r ) if phase r is within train i\u2019s route; x i ( r ) ( s ) : the state vector of train i \u2208 I ( r ) in phase r, x i ( r ) ( s ) = [ v i ( r ) ( s ) , t i ( r ) ( s ) ] T , containing train i\u2019s speed and time; u i ( r ) ( s ) : the control vector of train i \u2208 I ( r ) in phase r, u i ( r ) ( s ) = [ f i ( r ) ( s ) , b i ( r ) ( s ) ] T , containing train i\u2019s traction and braking forces; V i max , ( r ) ( s ) : the speed limit of train i \u2208 I ( r ) in phase r; R l i n e , i ( r ) ( s ) : the line resistance of train i \u2208 I ( r ) caused by the constant gradient within phase r; \u03bei : direction indicators, \u03be i = 0 if i \u2208 I d , otherwise \u03be i = 1 ; \u03bb i ( r ) : the normalization parameter, \u03bb i ( r ) equals the value of \u03bbi (see Section 4.3) of train i \u2208 I ( r ) in phase r; D i , s f ( m ) min , D i , s f ( m ) max : the lower and upper bound of the dwell time of train i at s f ( m ) , s f ( m ) is a stop point, m \u2208 R . The multiple-phase optimal control problem formulation of the MTTO model is: (16) Minimize J = \u2211 r = 1 R J ( r ) , (17) J ( r ) = \u2211 i \u2208 I ( r ) J i ( r ) , J i ( r ) = { \u03c9 i ( r ) \u00b7 t i ( r ) ( s f ( r ) ) + \u03bb i ( r ) \u222b s 0 ( r ) s f ( r ) f i ( r ) ( s ) d s , if i \u2208 I d , \u03c9 i ( r ) \u00b7 t i ( r ) ( s 0 ( r ) ) + \u03bb i ( r ) \u222b s 0 ( r ) s f ( r ) f i ( r ) ( s ) d s , if i \u2208 I u , subject to the dynamic constraints: (18) { d v i ( r ) ( s ) d s = ( \u2212 1 ) \u03be i \u03bb i ( r ) \u03b8 1 f i ( r ) ( s ) \u2212 \u03b8 2 b i ( r ) ( s ) \u2212 R t r a i n , i ( v i ( r ) ) \u2212 R l i n e , i ( r ) ( s ) \u03c1 i \u00b7 m i \u00b7 v i ( r ) ( s ) , d t i ( r ) ( s ) d s = ( \u2212 1 ) \u03be i \u03bb i ( r ) 1 v i ( r ) ( s ) , \u2200 r \u2208 R , i \u2208 I ( r ) , the path constraints: (19) { 0 \u2264 f i ( r ) ( s ) \u2264 F i max , 0 \u2264 b i ( r ) ( s ) \u2264 B i max , 0 \u2264 f i ( r ) ( s ) \u00b7 v i ( r ) ( s ) \u2264 P i max , 0 \u2264 v i ( r ) ( s ) \u2264 V i max , ( r ) ( s ) , A i min \u2264 d v i ( r ) ( s ) d t i ( r ) ( s ) \u2264 A i max , \u2200 r \u2208 R , i \u2208 I ( r ) , the phase boundary conditions (if any): (20) { v i , z , e min \u2264 v i ( r ) ( k i , z , e ) \u2264 v i , z , e max , t i , z , e min \u2264 t i ( r ) ( k i , z , e ) \u2264 t i , z , e max , \u2200 r \u2208 R , i \u2208 I ( r ) , k i , z , e \u2208 K TCS i \u2229 { s 0 ( r ) , s f ( r ) } , the event constraints (if any): (21) { ( t i ( r ) ( q ) \u2212 t j ( r ) ( q ) ) 2 \u2265 h s 2 , \u2200 r \u2208 R , ( i , j ) \u2208 I s : i , j \u2208 I ( r ) , q \u2208 Signal i , j \u2229 { s 0 ( r ) , s f ( r ) } , ( t i ( r ) ( q ) \u2212 t j ( r ) ( q ) ) 2 \u2265 h o 2 , \u2200 r \u2208 R , ( i , j ) \u2208 I o : i , j \u2208 I ( r ) , q \u2208 StationSignal i , j \u2229 { s 0 ( r ) , s f ( r ) } , ( t i ( r ) ( s 0 ( r ) ) \u2212 t j ( r ) ( s 0 ( r ) ) ) ( t i ( r ) ( s f ( r ) ) \u2212 t j ( r ) ( s f ( r ) ) ) \u2265 \u03c3 , \u2200 r \u2208 R , ( i , j ) \u2208 I o : i , j \u2208 I ( r ) , [ s 0 ( r ) , s f ( r ) ] \u2208 SingleTrack i , j , and the linkage conditions of all adjacent phases: (22) { v i ( m ) ( s f ( m ) ) \u2212 v i ( n ) ( s 0 ( n ) ) = 0 , D i , s f ( m ) min \u2264 t i ( n ) ( s 0 ( n ) ) \u2212 t i ( m ) ( s f ( m ) ) \u2264 D i , s f ( m ) max , \u2200 ( m , n ) \u2208 A , i \u2208 I ( m ) \u2229 I ( n ) . The MTTO model aims at minimizing the sum of the cost functions over all phases. Each phase r \u2208 R has its own cost function and constraints for the train(s) belonging to I ( r ) , if I ( r ) is not empty. More specifically, the cost functions (17) represent the optimization targets of minimizing the total delay and energy consumption of train(s) going through phase r. Every single train\u2019s cost function J i ( r ) is developed based on Eq. (6). For train i \u2208 I u , which goes from s f ( r ) to s 0 ( r ) , t i ( r ) ( s f ( r ) ) refers to the departure time of train i from s f ( r ) , and t i ( r ) ( s 0 ( r ) ) refers to the arrival time at s 0 ( r ) , so J i ( r ) uses t i ( r ) ( s 0 ( r ) ) in the first term. The dynamic constraints (18) are stated with s as the independent variable, representing the dynamic differential equations. ( \u2212 1 ) \u03be i is adopted to eliminate the influence of traveling directions. \u03bb i ( r ) is adopted for the normalization of section lengths. The path constraints (19) represent the operational constraints of vehicle characteristics, speed limits and riding comfort. The boundary conditions (20) represent the time and speed restrictions at timetable points if phase r\u2019s initial or terminal point is a timetable point. The event constraints (21) are developed based on (7) to avoid conflicts and separate trains. Constraints (21) are required if I ( r ) includes more than one train. In addition, the linkage conditions (22) are to make sure that the train\u2019s speed-distance and time-distance trajectories are continuous. If the linkage point of two successive phases is a stop point of a train i, t i ( m ) ( s f ( m ) ) and t i ( n ) ( s 0 ( n ) ) represent the arrival or departure times of train i at s f ( m ) , and D i , s f ( m ) min , D i , s f ( m ) max are the minimum or maximum dwell times of train i at s f ( m ) . Otherwise, D i , s f ( m ) min = D i , s f ( m ) max = 0 . The multiple-phase optimal control problem can be solved with a pseudospectral method. In general, pseudospectral methods transcribe the continuous-time optimal control problem into a discrete nonlinear programming problem, after which nonlinear programming solvers are adopted to directly solve the problem. 4.5 Driving strategies and weight factors A weight factor \u03c9 i ( r ) is used in cost functions (17) to balance delay recovery and energy saving. The weight factor \u03c9 i ( r ) should be determined firstly before adopting the pseudospectral methods to solve the MTTO model. Different weight factors contribute to different optimization results. The effect of weight factor values is discussed in Wang and Goverde (2016c). In this paper, \u03c9 i ( r ) = 10 4 is used for delay recovery, which gives more priority to delay recovery than to energy saving (note the difference in scale of time and energy), while weight factor \u03c9 i ( r ) = 10 2 is adopted for energy saving, which gives more priority to energy saving than to delay recovery. The priorities of delay recovery and energy saving of different trains at different running sections are different. In case of delays, three driving strategies can be considered: 1. Delay-recovery strategy: This strategy is used to make up delays and drive the train as fast as possible. Weight factor \u03c9 i ( r ) = 10 4 if train i uses the delay-recovery strategy in the running section where phase r belongs to. 2. Energy-saving strategy: This strategy is adopted for energy-efficient driving that makes full use of given running times. Weight factor \u03c9 i ( r ) = 10 2 if train i uses the energy-saving strategy strategy in the running section where phase r belongs to. 3. On-time strategy: This strategy makes the train return to the schedule. Weight factor \u03c9 i ( r ) = 10 2 if train i uses the on-time strategy in the running section where phase r belongs to. In addition, the TCS arrival time window at the next stop is reset as a time point constraint, such as [scheduled arrival time, scheduled arrival time]. The energy-saving strategy uses a time window constraint for arrival at the next stop while the on-time strategy uses a time point constraint which commands the train to arrive at the scheduled time. In general, the energy-saving strategy is used if the train has increased travel time due to waiting for a meeting another delayed train, while an on-time strategy is adopted if the train is able to reach the next stop on time. A driving strategy selection algorithm is designed to select proper driving strategies for each train and each running section. By selecting the driving strategies, weight factors of the MTTO model are set. The first step is to estimate potential meeting stations. As mentioned in Section 3, the stations within the overlap parts of TCS time regions of opposite trains are potential meeting stations. Different meet plans produce different delay propagations. The first step of the driving strategy selection algorithm is to find a meeting plan, which produces minimal total estimated delays. Train delays are estimated by assuming the trains follow the FCFS (first-come, first-served) principle, the delayed trains run at maximum power, and other trains follow their schedules if their operations are not affected by delays. For detailed delay estimation methods, we recommend the works by Goverde (2007); 2010). The best meeting station for train i is represented by ni . Two parameters \u03b7 i , n i and \u03b2 i, z are adopted for later driving strategy setting. \u03b7 i , n i represents the estimated meeting time at ni. \u03b2 i, z refers to the secondary delay caused by the meeting event at ni . For stations before ni , \u03b2 i , z = 0 because train i is not affected by the meeting event yet. For stations after ni , \u03b2 i , z = max { t i , n i , a min , t j , n i , a min } \u2212 t i , n i , a min , which equals the secondary delay at station ni . The second step is to set the driving strategies. It contains two loops. The first loop is to preset driving strategies for every train and every running sections. It is done by comparing the lower bounds of the TCS time windows plus the estimated secondary delays with the scheduled times. t i , z , a min + \u03b2 i , z > S i , z , a means that the train cannot return back to schedule at station z even with the minimal running time. Therefore, a delay-recovery strategy is adopted to reduce delays. If t i , z , a min + \u03b2 i , z \u2264 S i , z , a , the train has sufficient running time to reach the next stop, thus an on-time strategy is used in the running section before station z. The second loop is designed to adjust the driving strategies for the running sections just before the estimated meeting station ni . If t i , z , a min < \u03b7 i , n i , train i arrives first and shall wait for another train. Hence, train i has extra time margin for energy-efficient driving. So an energy-saving strategy is selected before the meeting station. If t i , z , a min = max { t i , n i , a min , t j , n i , a min } and t i , z , a min < S i , z , a , train i may get an early arrival at ni to let the opposite delayed train leave the station earlier. Therefore a delay recovery strategy is selected. Two examples of the driving strategy selection algorithm is presented in Fig. 6 . The yellow lines represent the sum of lower bounds of TCS time windows and estimated secondary delay caused by meeting events. By comparing yellow lines and scheduled paths, different driving strategies are selected for different running sections. 5 Case studies A single-track corridor between Schagen (Sgn) and Den Helder (Hdr) in the north of the Netherlands is adopted for the case study, see Fig. 7 . The infrastructure data is provided by the infrastructure manager Prorail. There are 4 stations along this corridor: Schagen (Sgn), Anna Paulowna (Ana), Den Helder Zuid (Hdrz), and Den Helder (Hdr). The infrastructure characteristics consist of a description of all track sections, points, speed signs, gradients and signals over the entire track layout. Two trains operate on this corridor each half hour, one in each direction. The static parameters of the train used in this case study are listed in Table 1 . The traction force and train resistance curves are shown in Fig. 8 . Since the braking rate is the only accessible data characterizing the braking behavior, we let the braking force be equal to the braking rate times train mass. Table 2 shows the arrival and departure times of a pair of trains from opposite directions within the basic half-hour pattern. T 1 represents the train from Hdr to Sgn and T 2 represents the opposite train. The second and third columns show the arrival and departure times. This timetable is based on the timetable in use in 2016. The two trains are scheduled to meet at Ana station, and the dwell time there is 1 min. The scheduled dwell times at other stations are 0.5 min. The last column of Table 2 shows the planned tracks at the stations. T 1 and T 2 use different tracks at station Hdr, Hdrz, Ana and Sgn, so that the four stations can be adopted as meeting stations. 5.1 Two-train trajectory optimization The corridor between Sgn and Hdr uses a periodic timetable. Two opposite trains operate on this corridor each half hour. We first tested our proposed method with two trains within a basic half-hour pattern in 4 cases within total 9 different initial delays as shown in Table 3 . The scheduled Case assumes the two trains operate according to the given timetable. Case A and B discuss the situation that one train follows the schedule whereas another train has initial delays, Case C considers the situation that both trains have initial delays. Initial delays were added to train T 1 and T 2 at their departure station Hdr and Sgn, respectively. The TCSs for both trains were calculated first. Each TCS consists of time and speed limits at every station. The speed limits at the stop points are 0. The time windows were calculated with the method from Section 3. It is assumed a minimal dwell time of 0.5 min and maximal dwell time of 5 min. The multi-train trajectory optimization method in Section 4 was used to find the optimal energy-efficient delay recovery trajectories within the TCSs. The parameters in (21) were set as h s = 120 s, \u03c3 = 5 s and h o = 15 s. The value of hs is set according to the network statement 2017 by ProRail (2017). Default headway norms are used that should be sufficient for the final timetable to be conflict-free and contain some buffer. The value of ho ensures enough time interval for signal clearing and route setting. \u03c3 is a positive value to avoid any crossover of opposite trains\u2019 path. A pseudospectral method is applied for solving the multiple-phase optimal control problem. There exist several commercial and free packages that implement the pseudospectral method. We adopted GPOPS (Rao et al., 2010) with the Radau Pseudospectral Method as the solver. The experiments were carried out with GPOPS 4.1 on a laptop equipped with a 3.2\u202fGHz Pentium R processor. As for the parameter settings of GPOPS, we used \u2018complex\u2019 as the string to indicate the differentiation method, a tolerance of 1e-3, an iteration of 2, and didn\u2019t use autoscaling. The explanation of the parameters can be found in Rao et al. (2011). Fig. 9 show the speed profiles and time-distance paths of the two on-time train. Figs. 10 \u201312 present the results of the 9 different initial delays. Each figure has three subplots considering three combinations of initial delays. Within each subplot, the top-left plot is the optimized speed profile of train T 1 from left to right, the lower-left plot is the optimized speed profile of train T 2 from right to left. The solid black lines represent the optimized speed profiles and the red horizontal lines refer to the static speed limits. The driving strategies for each running sections are identified with \u2018DR\u2019, \u2018ES\u2019 and \u2018OT\u2019 in the figures. \u2018DR\u2019, \u2018ES\u2019 and \u2018OT\u2019 are respectively the abbreviations of delay-recovery strategy, energy-saving strategy and on-time strategy. The right plot shows the optimized time-distance paths, where the solid black lines refer to the optimized results, the dashed red lines are the planned linearized time-distance paths, and the gray regions are the time regions of train T 1 and T 2 formed by their TCSs. The gray vertical lines represent the first home signals outside stations at both sides, so that the segments between two close gray vertical lines are stations with multiple tracks. Train time-distance paths are only allowed to intersect within the station areas. Table 4 shows the optimized results of the Scheduled Case, Case A, B and C. The 2nd column presents the output delays of train T 1 at station Sgn. The 3rd column shows the energy consumption to drive T 1 from Hdr to Sgn. The 4th and 5th columns show the delays of train T 2 at station Hdr and the energy consumption to drive T 2 from Sgn to Hdr. The 6th column is the sum of delays of T 1 at Sgn and T 2 at Hdr. The 7th column gives the energy consumption of T 1 and T 2 in the single-track corridor between Hdr and Sgn. The last column gives the computation times. Within the 2nd, 4th and 6th columns, upward arrows and downward arrows mean that the output delays are increased (\u2191) or decreased (\u2193) compared with the initial delays (the delays of train T 1 at Hdr, and of train T 2 at Sgn). Taking an overall look of Figs. 9\u201312, the train speeds stay below the speed limits and trains stop at every planned stop point, which means the optimized results ensure safe traveling speeds and accurate stops. The time-distance paths show that the two trains cannot follow the scheduled paths under delay conditions. But the optimized time-distance paths stay within the TCSs, and they only cross each other in station areas, so no conflicts occur between them. In Fig. 9, T 1 and T 2 have no delays. The on-time driving strategy is used during every running section. The optimal control regimes between every two stops include using maximum traction during the outbound processes, maximum braking force for the inbound processes, and in between possible cruising and coasting before braking to save energy, which matches the theoretical driving strategy following from application of the PMP. Fig. 10 shows the results in the case that only T 2 has delays (Case A). T 2 uses the delay recovery strategy over all the corridor between Hdr and Sgn. The optimized control regimes consist of maximum traction during the outbound processes, maximum braking force for the inbound processes, and cruising at maximum allowed speed. No coasting is used so that the delayed train can move as fast as possible and get back to schedule gradually. Train T 1 has no delay at Hdr station, however gets influenced by the delays of train T 2. In Fig. 10 (a) that T 2 is 5\u202fmin delayed at Sgn station, T 1 and T 2 meet at station Ana. The optimized meeting time is late than the scheduled meeting time. Train T 1 uses the energy saving strategy and coasts more during the running between Hdrz and Ana. T 1 speeds up after Ana to make up the delay caused by the delayed meeting event. Fig. 10(b) and (c) show the cases that the optimized meeting station is changed to Sgn when T 2 has bigger delays. The new meeting station is beneficial for minimizing delays, because train T 2 would waste time waiting for T 1 and cause a future delay of T 2 if T 1 and T 2 meet at the scheduled meeting station. In Fig. 10(b), T 1 adopts the delay recovery strategy and arrives at station Sgn a few seconds before the scheduled arrival time, so that T 2 is able to leave Sgn as soon as possible after 10\u202fmin delay. Fig. 10(c) shows the case that T 2 is 15\u202fmin delayed and T 1 can follow its schedule and arrive at Sgn before the delayed T 2. Fig. 11 (a)\u2013(c) present the optimized results in case that T 1 has different initial delays at Hdr, while T 2 departs on-time from Sgn. When T 1 is 5\u202fmin delayed (Fig. 11(a)), the trains meet at station Ana, T 1 uses the delay recovery strategy with less coasting and more cruising at maximum speeds to reduce delays. T 2 is delayed to meet train T 1 at station Ana, but the delay is recovered in the following journey. In Fig. 11(b) and (c), the two trains meet at station Hdrz. Train T 2 follows the scheduled paths during the section between Sgn and Ana. Then it speeds up to arrive earlier (Fig. 11(b)) or slows down to arrive later (Fig. 11(c)) than the scheduled time at station Hdrz, so that T 1 can use the released section between Hdrz and Ana. In Fig. 11(b), train T 1 is even secondarily delayed because of waiting for entering the open track between Hdrz and Ana. However, T 2 is able to return back to the scheduled times at station Hdr in all three cases (a), (b) and (c). Fig. 12 shows the optimized results that both trains are delayed from their departure stations (Case C). Both train\u2019s trajectories in the three scenarios are different. But the delayed trains tend to use control regimes of maximum traction, cruising at maximum speeds and maximum braking to reduce delays. Only within the sections before the meeting stations, the train might coast more to anticipate for the meeting events. For instance, T 1 uses the delay-recovery strategy in the running sections between Hdr and Ana in Fig. 12(b), and between Hdr and Hdrz in Fig. 12(c). Overall, we see that our algorithm can calculate speed and time-distance trajectories for two opposite trains. The trajectories avoid conflicts between the two trains by adjusting running times, dwell times and meeting stations. The speed profiles illustrate the three different driving strategies of the delay-recovery, energy-saving and on-time strategy, for different delay scenarios. Table 4 presented the numerical results of the 10 scenarios. In general, we see an increase on the total energy consumption comparing the delay and no-delay situations. However there are exceptions when the delays of a single train may increase due to waiting for the meeting events. For instance, the delay of train T 1 increases in Case B (b) because of meeting T 2 at Hdrz. The total delay is reduced comparing the output delay and initial delay. The reason is the use of the delay-recovery strategy, which makes the train run as fast as possible and costs a lot of energy consumption. But the energy-saving and on-time strategies reduce the energy consumption. Take Case B (c) as an example, T 2 uses the energy saving strategy on the running section between Ana and Hdrz and the on-time strategy on the other two running sections. Train T 2 uses less energy consumption comparing with the scheduled case. The average computation time of the 10 scenarios is 73.92 s, while the minimal computation time is 40.1 s and the maximum number is 95.44 s. The computations are carried out on a laptop equipped with a 3.2\u202fGHz Pentium R processor. 5.2 Discussion Compared to the single-train trajectory optimization method, the multi-train trajectory optimization method is able to avoid conflicts between trains. Take Case C (b) as an example, T 1 and T 2 both have initial delays at Hdr and Sgn. Fig. 13 presented a comparison of the results computed by the STTO method and the MTTO method. The optimized results by applying the STTO method aim at reducing delays. The two trains travel at the maximum speeds in order to get back to schedule as quick as possible. However, the two trains meet at the single-track corridor between Ana and Sgn, which is forbidden. The MTTO method is able to avoid conflicts and lets the trains meet at a station region. Second, the proposed method allows a change of meeting locations. The driving strategy selection algorithm first estimates potential meeting locations, and accordingly selects best driving strategies for different running sections. The optimal meeting location and time are found by the MTTO method together with the optimal speed curves. The optimal meeting location and time enables a reduction of delay propagation. Last but not last, the proposed algorithm balances the energy saving and delay recovery requirements. Once a train is delayed, the first priority is to reduce delays instead of save energy consumption. The energy consumption is only saved in the cases that the train is on-time or the train has to wait for another train. Section 5.1 discussed the train trajectory optimization for two delayed opposite trains on a single-track line. However, the delays may propagate to other trains in the next half-hour pattern. For instance, in Case A (c) T 2\u2019s delay will be propagated to the next half-hour pattern. In that case, it is necessary to take into account all affected trains. Fig. 14 shows the results of four trains within a hour pattern using the multi-train optimization model. Train T 2 is 15\u202fmin delayed at station Sgn (Case A(c)). T 3 is affected by T 2 and gets delayed at Hdr but it speeds up during the remaining journey and the delay is reduced gradually. Fig. 14 shows that the time-distance paths of the four trains only meet within station areas, which shows that the multi-train optimization method produces feasible trajectories. The computation time for the four-train case is 131.76 s. 6 Conclusions This paper proposed a novel method of multi-train trajectory optimization. Traditional train speed profile optimization focuses on one single-train from one stop to another stop, but the method proposed by us is able to compute trajectories for multi-trains simultaneously. We developed a multi-train trajectory optimization method with a multi-phase optimal control problem formulation for trains on single-track lines. The model consists of the dynamic behavior and operational constraints for multiple trains, as well as constraints to avoid conflicts between trains. A pseudospectral method was adopted for solving the problem. By jointly optimizing trains\u2019 energy consumption and delay recovery, the method computes a feasible schedule with optimal meeting locations and associated speed profiles simultaneously. Case studies of two opposite trains running on a Dutch single-track corridor showed that our method is able to produce speed and time-distance trajectories for the opposite trains. The trajectories avoid conflicts between two trains by adjusted running times, dwell times and meeting stations. The speed profiles consider energy-saving driving as well as delay recovery requirements using the three different driving strategies of delay-recovery, energy-saving and on-time running for different delay scenarios. Finally, a case study of multi-train trajectory optimization was presented that computes speed profiles and schedules for four trains at the same time. The proposed method can be used in practice to combine conflict detection and resolution with energy-efficient driving. It provides feasible schedules as well as energy-efficient speed profiles, which gives a new approach to rescheduling and timetable design. References Albrecht, Howlett, Pudney, Vu, Zhou, 2016 A.
