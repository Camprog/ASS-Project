"Transportation Research Part B: MethodologicalAnalytical formulation and empirical evaluation of pre-signals for bus priorityAbstract One of the major causes of bus delays in urban environments are signalized intersections. A commonly used solution to give priority to buses at signalized intersections is to dedicate a lane for bus-use only. However this strategy can waste valuable green time at signals and impose additional delays to cars, especially when bus flows are low. Overall, the total person hours of delays in the system (i.e., buses and cars) can increase due to excessive delays experienced by car users. To this end, an additional signal upstream of the main signal, called a pre-signal, can be used to better utilize the capacity of the main signal while still providing bus priority to reduce the system-wide person hours of delays. The aim of this research is to analytically quantify and empirically evaluate the delays encountered by cars and buses with the use of pre-signals. The ultimate goal is to provide domains of applications for the proposed strategy. The paper presents analytical formulations to compute bus and car delays using queuing theory. The analytical models show that for a wide range of cases pre-signals can minimize the system-wide person hours of delays, as compared to dedicating a lane for bus-use only or operating buses and cars completely mixed. The analytical model is validated with empirical data collected at an existing pre-signal, which shows that the delay predictions of the model closely follow reality.serial JL 271728 291210 291772 291817 31 Transportation Research Part B: Methodological TRANSPORTATIONRESEARCHPARTBMETHODOLOGICAL 2014-04-16 2014-04-16 2014-05-10T12:46:28 1-s2.0-S0191261514000460 S0191-2615(14)00046-0 S0191261514000460 10.1016/j.trb.2014.03.004 S300 S300.1 FULL-TEXT 1-s2.0-S0191261514X00056 2015-05-14T05:39:52.915433-04:00 0 0 20140601 20140630 2014 2014-04-16T00:00:00Z articleinfo crossmark dco dateupdated tomb dateloaded datesearch indexeddate volumelist yearnav articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright dateloadedtxt docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdateend pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype subheadings suppl volfirst volissue webpdf webpdfpagecount figure table body mmlmath affil appendices articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authkeywords authlast footnotes highlightsabst primabst ref alllist content subj ssids 0191-2615 01912615 true 64 64 C Volume 64 4 41 53 41 53 201406 June 2014 2014-06-01 2014-06-30 2014 article fla Copyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract One of the major causes of bus delays in urban environments are signalized intersections. A commonly used solution to give priority to buses at signalized intersections is to dedicate a lane for bus-use only. However this strategy can waste valuable green time at signals and impose additional delays to cars, especially when bus flows are low. Overall, the total person hours of delays in the system (i.e., buses and cars) can increase due to excessive delays experienced by car users. To this end, an additional signal upstream of the main signal, called a pre-signal, can be used to better utilize the capacity of the main signal while still providing bus priority to reduce the system-wide person hours of delays. The aim of this research is to analytically quantify and empirically evaluate the delays encountered by cars and buses with the use of pre-signals. The ultimate goal is to provide domains of applications for the proposed strategy. The paper presents analytical formulations to compute bus and car delays using queuing theory. The analytical models show that for a wide range of cases pre-signals can minimize the system-wide person hours of delays, as compared to dedicating a lane for bus-use only or operating buses and cars completely mixed. The analytical model is validated with empirical data collected at an existing pre-signal, which shows that the delay predictions of the model closely follow reality. Keywords Pre-signals Bus lanes Transit priority Traffic flow 1 Introduction In urban areas, to provide faster and more reliable bus service, priority to buses is often given by dedicating a lane for bus-use only. When bus flows are low, an underutilized bus lane running through a bottleneck can significantly reduce total discharge flows from the bottleneck. These reduced discharge flows can increase car delays and cause car queues to grow and spill back to other bottlenecks (or intersections in the case of an urban network). Therefore, the total person hours of delay in the system can increase when dedicated bus lanes are applied. However, it is possible to improve the system without harming buses by allowing cars to share the space between buses only at bottlenecks. These types of dynamic bus lane allocations have been previously investigated. On signalized arterials the use of intermittent bus lanes (IBL) was proposed by Viegas and Lu (2001, 2004). In this strategy, cars are banned from using a section of a lane residing downstream of an advancing bus. This allows for the bus to travel without being impeded by cars. However, when buses are not present, cars using this lane can increase the discharge flow from the arterial. Cars are alerted of the lane change restriction with the aid of electronic signs and signals. In this strategy, cars do not vacate their present lane when the restriction is activated. Field experiments conducted in Lisbon, Portugal, showed that intermittent bus lanes can increase bus speeds by 15\u201325% as compared against buses and cars traveling mixed on the same lanes. A variation of intermittent bus lanes was also field tested in Melbourne, Australia, in 2001 (Currie and Lai, 2008). Even though travel time improvements to buses were observed in Melbourne as well, the authors found that these improvements were not as significant as in the case of Lisbon. On a variation of this idea named bus lanes with intermittent priority (BLIP), cars are required to vacate their present lane in advance of an approaching bus (Eichler and Daganzo, 2006). In this theoretical study, the authors found that the application of BLIPs reduces the interaction between buses and cars, and this can significantly reduce bus delays. More recent work has explored the domains of application of shared bus lanes (Guler and Cassidy, 2012). By using traffic flow theory tools, their work analytically determined the bus flows for which shared bus lanes would increase the capacity of the roadway as compared to fully dedicated bus lanes. This work also tested the use of shared bus lanes on a case study using means of simulation, and showed that dynamically shared lanes can decrease bus delays without inflicting large car delays as compared to the two modes operating completely mixed on roadways. Chiabaut et al. (2012) theoretically analyzed the capacity of BLIPs while also taking into account capacity drops that might arise due to the merging and acceleration of lane-changing vehicles at the first signalized intersection of an arterial where BLIPs are implemented. The authors concluded that this activation effect can be negated if the signalized arterial on which BLIPs are implemented is long enough (i.e., consists of 6 or more intersections). Beyond this length, travel time benefits to buses can be expected with the implementation of BLIPs. Other works have used cellular automaton models to compare different bus operating strategies (IBLs, dedicated bus lanes, mixed use lanes) in terms of flows and velocities of buses and cars (Zhu, 2010), and also to determine suitable traffic conditions for which IBLs could be implemented (Qiu et al., 2014). The use of pre-signals (i.e., an additional signal upstream of the main signal) has been proposed by Wu and Hounsell (1998) to increase the discharge flow from isolated signalized intersections while still providing bus priority. When there are multiple lanes approaching the intersection, and one is dedicated for bus-use only, the idea is to discontinue this bus lane some distance upstream of the intersection. A pre-signal is used at this location to provide bus priority. The pre-signal allows cars to use all lanes to discharge from the main signal, except when a bus arrives to this location. At that time, the pre-signal turns red for cars. This allows for buses to maneuver into the intersection without encountering conflicts from cars, and provides bus priority by moving them to the front of the intersection. Wu and Hounsell (1998) suggests and evaluates three different control strategies for pre-signals. However, this work makes two restrictive assumptions which affect the modeling: (i) a constant arrival of buses to the intersection, which is a very coarse approximation when looking at a single cycle where typically at most one bus will arrive; and (ii) a fixed operation at the pre-signal not responsive to the arrival of a bus, which can impose unnecessary delays on buses. While these assumptions make the analysis simpler, most operational complications which arise with the use of pre-signals cannot be modeled (for example disruptions in the car flow, car queues which may not clear in a given cycle, etc.). Therefore, both of these assumptions are relaxed in this paper. First, this paper explicitly models the car and bus delays which arise with the arrival of individual buses to the pre-signal. This improves the model suggested by Wu and Hounsell (1998) since the car delays which are expected to occur when a bus arrives to the pre-signal are more accurately determined, and the bus operations are modeled more realistically. Note that the modeling approach used in this paper is also slightly restrictive since it can at most consider one bus per signal cycle. However, even with this restriction, relatively high bus flows can still be modeled (e.g., the flow would be 60buses/h for a cycle length of a minute). Second, this paper allows the bus to always have priority at the pre-signal, regardless of when it arrives (even if this priority leads to a loss of the main signal capacity). This improves the model of Wu and Hounsell (1998) since bus delays can be further reduced. Notice that no empirical evaluation of pre-signals have been found in the literature. This might be due to the fact that, to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, real-world implementations of pre-signals are very limited. They are used at several locations in London in a manner similar to that described in Wu and Hounsell (1998) and Transport for London (2005). One implementation of a pre-signal in Switzerland is found in Zurich, where a dedicated lane for buses and one lane for cars on an intersection approach merge into a single mixed-use lane at a signalized intersection. A pre-signal is located at the location of the merge to give priority to buses when approaching the main signal. In this paper, we present empirical data collected at this location. This allows us to empirically evaluate the operation of pre-signals, and more importantly verify the improved analytical models. While pre-signals can increase the total number of vehicles discharging from the intersection (i.e., maximize capacity with respect to dedicated bus lanes) it is unclear whether this strategy would also minimize the system-wide person hours of delays. In Section 2 the operation of a pre-signal and the analytical modeling of delays at a pre-signal are described. The empirical data collected to validate the analytical model and a summary of the results are presented in Section 3. Once a complete understanding of delays encountered at pre-signals is obtained, domains on bus occupancies for which pre-signals can minimize the total person hour delay are determined in Section 4. A summary of results and future research directions are discussed in Section 5. 2 Operation and evaluation of pre-signals A typical layout for a pre-signal can be seen in Fig. 1 . The pre-signal is located upstream of the main signal at a distance such that when buses are not present the green time at the main signal can be fully utilized (i.e., it is possible to have enough queued cars to saturate the green phase). While multiple operating strategies for the pre-signal can exist, for the remainder of this paper the strategy described below will be considered to minimize the additional bus delays imposed due to the presence of the pre-signal. This strategy was chosen after the analysis of multiple other operating strategies since it provides the lowest system-wide person hours of delays for a range of (typical) bus occupancies. Note that this delay could be further decreased with the use of transit signal priority at the main signal. However, since transit signal priority strategies are typically location specific, they will not be included as part of the analysis in this paper. The operating strategy for the pre-signal is described below. \u2022 The pre-signal turns red for cars: \u2013 In advance of a red main signal such that cars initially queue only upstream of the pre-signal. This time can be thought of as an offset between the pre-signal and the main signal and is equal to the distance between the pre-signal and main signal divided by the free flow speed. Queuing cars at the pre-signal ensures that an arriving bus can move to the stop line at the main signal and discharge immediately when the main signal turns green. \u2013 When a bus arrives to the pre-signal, regardless of the main signal\u2019s phase. 1 The bus arrival time can be predicted with the use of bus to infrastructure communication systems. We expect that the exact arrival time of a bus can be predicted with high accuracy since the bus arrives to this location on a dedicated lane without being interrupted by other modes. This would be true whether or not a bus stop exists upstream of the pre-signal, as buses could announce their departure as they are pulling out of a bus stop to receive priority at the pre-signal. However, the details of the prediction of the bus arrival time are out of the scope of this paper. 1 This gives the bus priority to move to the main signal without encountering conflicting maneuvers from cars. \u2022 The pre-signal turns green for cars: \u2013 At the latest possible time (in advance of the green main signal) such that vehicles are able to discharge from the main signal without encountering any additional delays as compared to the use of mixed lanes. Again, the travel time of cars from the pre-signal to the main signal (the offset) should be accounted for when implementing the start of the green time. In order not to starve the main signal of flow, if the number of car lanes upstream of the pre-signal is less than the number of mixed use lanes (as is in Fig. 1), cars discharging from the pre-signal would briefly form a queue again at the main signal. \u2013 When a passing bus clears the pre-signal (given that the pre-signal would have been green if no bus were present). Notice that with this mechanism, in cycles during which buses are not present, the car delay will remain the same as in the case of mixed use lanes, but the number of stops experienced by cars may increase. Another consideration could be the bounded acceleration of cars, since the discussion above assumes that cars can instantaneously accelerate to free flow speed. However, this can easily be accounted for by modifying the offset between the start of the green at the pre-signal and the main signal to represent the travel time of a car accelerating from a stopped position between the pre-signal and the main signal rather than the free flow travel time. Then, the operation of the pre-signal can continue exactly as described above. To better visualize the operation of a pre-signal, the time\u2013space diagram of a cycle during which buses are not present is shown in the bottom of Fig. 2 , along with the corresponding fundamental diagram in the top of Fig. 2. In this figure a main signal (MS) with effective red time of r ms hours and total cycle length of C hours, and a pre-signal (PS) with effective red time of r ps hours 2 Note that the value of r ps can be calculated using other input parameters as shown in Eq. (A.2) in Appendix A. 2 is depicted. The fundamental diagram of the section of road upstream of the pre-signal is depicted with the thin solid line (in the top figure) and has a total saturation flow of q s \u2032 veh/h and total jam density of k j \u2032 veh/km for all the lanes. The fundamental diagram of the section of road between the pre-signal and the main signal is depicted with the thick solid line and has a total saturation flow of q s veh/h and a total jam density of k j veh/km for all the lanes. The arrival rate of cars, q a , is also shown. The corresponding traffic states are also labeled in capital letters in this figure. The two dashed lines connecting states S\u2032 to J and A to J\u2032 are the slopes of the shockwaves with which the information of a change in the traffic state is carried through traffic. These shockwaves are also shown in the time space diagram (with the same dashed lines and slopes) between the different traffic states which arise. This figure is meant to illustrate the green and red duration at the pre-signal, how they are related to the main signal timings, and also the queues that form at the pre-signal and the main signal. Now let\u2019s consider the case where the pre-signal turns green for cars at a different time than proposed above (assuming the same start time for the red). If it turns green earlier, this would imply that the queue at the main signal would be longer (without reducing car delays) than shown in Fig. 2. This will impose unnecessary additional delays on buses which can get caught in this queue at the pre-signal. In the extreme case, the pre-signal would always be green for cars, and buses arriving during the red main signal would have no priority over cars. On the other hand, if the pre-signal turns green later than proposed above, then the duration for which cars discharge with saturation flow q s would be shorter than in Fig. 2. Cars would also discharge with flow q s \u2032 for a certain duration, decreasing the capacity of the main signal. However, since the queue at the main signal will be shorter, the bus delays could be reduced. Nevertheless, further investigation of this scenario revealed that the reduction in delay for the buses do not compensate for the increase in delay for the cars when the red duration at the pre-signal is extended. Therefore, it is concluded that the above proposed operating strategy provides the lowest combined bus and car delays. The theoretical car and bus delays incurred at an intersection with a pre-signal are determined with the use of queuing theory. Queuing theory tools are used here because of their ease for depicting delays. The queuing diagram for an intersection with a pre-signal when no bus is present is shown in Fig. 3 . In this figure, a pre-signal and a main signal with the same parameters as before are depicted. Note that we use transformed (or virtual) cumulative curves, i.e., curves shifted in time so that separated curves indicate delays, and superimposed curves indicate free-flowing conditions between the measurement locations (Daganzo, 1997). Virtual arrival of cars to the main signal (i.e., the arrival time to the main signal if no queues were present) is shown as line A which has slope q a veh/h. The virtual departure of cars from the main signal for a cycle during which no bus is present is depicted as line D ms (with a maximum slope of q s veh/h). Line D ps (with a maximum slope of q s \u2032 veh/h) represents the virtual departure of cars from the pre-signal (i.e., the arrival times of cars to the main signal which have departed from the pre-signal if no queues were present). Since this is a virtual departure curve, and has been shifted by the free flow travel time, the red at the main signal and the pre-signal starts at the same time in this figure. To determine the car delay, a cycle for which a bus is present (assuming bus flows are low such that at most one bus arrives per cycle) was divided into seven unique time periods depending on the arrival time of the bus. The arrival of a bus within each time period leads to different queuing patterns due to the interruption of car flow. Fig. 4 shows the queuing diagrams for these seven cases. The range of bus arrival times that defines each specific case is also illustrated in this figure. These seven cases represent all possible queuing patterns. However, under certain combinations of the input parameters some of these cases might not arise. In addition to the notation used in Fig. 3, in Fig. 4 line D ms \u2032 represents the virtual departure of cars from the main signal for a cycle during which a bus is present. Similarly, line D ps \u2032 represents the virtual departure of cars from the pre-signal for a cycle during which a bus is present. The duration of additional red time cars encounter at the pre-signal to allow for the bus to pass is represented by r b (where r b \u226a r ms ). Also in cases (1), (2) and (3) a bus passing the pre-signal stops at the stop line or behind queued cars at the main signal. Hence, the passing of the bus at the main signal creates a gap in the flow of cars (since buses occupy additional space not included in the arrival curve of cars) causing additional car delays. The duration of the gap in the car flow created by the bus is depicted as t add in Fig. 4 ( t add < r b ). The gray shading in this figure represents additional car delays (in veh/h) due to the activation of the pre-signal when a bus approaches. The exact formulation for this type of additional delay can be found in Eqs. (A.3)\u2013(A.9) in Appendix A. The hatched shading represents additional car delays (in veh/h) due to the gap in the car flow created by the bus discharging at the main signal. The exact formulation for this type of additional delay can be found in Eqs. (A.10)\u2013(A.13) in Appendix A. To better visualize the different scenarios that may arise, each of the seven cases are briefly explained below: \u2022 In case (1), the bus arrives while both the main signal and the pre-signal are red, and at a time such that an extension of the red at the pre-signal is not required. However, since this bus moves to the head of the main signal, a small gap, t add , in car departures from the green main signal is created, leading to some additional car delays (as shown by the hatched area in Fig. 4). \u2022 In case (2), the bus arrives while both the main signal and the pre-signal are red, but at a time such that an extension of the red at the pre-signal is required. Since the red pre-signal is extended, the queue of cars that can form at the main signal before the green main signal is shorter. Hence gaps in the car flow are created, where cars that would have discharged at q s if no bus had arrived now have to discharge at q s \u2032 . This leads to additional delays to cars (as shown by the gray shading in Fig. 4). In addition, since the bus moves to the head of the main signal again a small gap, t add , is created in the stream of cars discharging from the main signal leading to further additional delays (as shown by the hatched shading in Fig. 4). \u2022 In case (3), the bus arrives when the pre-signal is green (the main signal could be red or green); and a queue of cars is present both at the main signal and the pre-signal. The arrival of a bus triggers a red pre-signal, immediately stopping the flow of cars from the pre-signal, such that the bus joins the back of the queue at the main signal. Cars already queued at the main signal can continue to discharge. The pre-signal turns green again before the queue of cars at the main signal is cleared. However, the main signal is still starved of flow at some point since the discharge flow of cars from the pre-signal ( q s \u2032 ) is lower than what can be discharged from the main signal ( q s ). This leads to additional delays to cars (as shown by the gray shading in Fig. 4). In addition, the presence of the bus in the stream of cars discharging from the main signal creates a small gap, t add , leading to further additional delays (as shown by the hatched shading in Fig. 4). \u2022 In case (4), once again the bus arrives when the pre-signal is green (the main signal could be green or red); and a (small) queue of cars is present both at the main signal and the pre-signal. The arrival of the bus triggers a red pre-signal. However, the queue of cars at the main signal clears before the pre-signal turns green again. This has two consequences: (1) the discharge of cars from the main signal is zero for a small period causing additional car delays (as shown by the gray shading in Fig. 4), and (2) the bus passes the main signal without encountering any delays and does not create an additional gap in the flow of cars from the main signal. \u2022 In case (5) the bus arrives while both the main signal and the pre-signal are green; and no queue of cars at the main signal or the pre-signal are present. Hence, the arrival of the bus triggers a red pre-signal, briefly starving the main signal of flow. This results in additional car delays, as shown by the gray shading in Fig. 4. However, the pre-signal turns green again in advance of the main signal turning red such that all cars queued at the pre-signal due to the arrival of the bus can still discharge within the same cycle. \u2022 In case (6) the bus arrives while both the main signal and the pre-signal are green; and no queue of cars at the main signal or the pre-signal are present. However, the bus arrives close to the end of a green main signal phase. Even though the pre-signal turns green again before a red main signal, some cars affected by the arrival of the bus cannot discharge within the same cycle and experience additional delays (as shown by the gray shading in Fig. 4). \u2022 In case (7) the bus arrives while both the main signal and the pre-signal are green; and no queue of cars at the main signal or the pre-signal are present. However, the bus arrival is at the end of the green cycle, and the main signal turns red before the end of the red pre-signal. Hence, all cars stopped at the pre-signal have to wait for a second cycle and experience additional delays (as shown by the gray shading in Fig. 4). The bus delays, based on the different bus arrival times presented in Fig. 4, can also be easily calculated. For cases (1) and (2), the bus simply departs when the main signal turns green since it arrives during a red phase at the main signal and the pre-signal allows it to move to the stop line at the intersection. For cases (3) and (4), the bus encounters some additional delay due to the car queue at the main signal. Hence, the bus delay in these cases is simply the delay from a small car queue only at the main signal (and the bus can always discharge within the same cycle of its arrival). For cases (5), (6) and (7), the bus departs without encountering any delays at the intersection. The exact formulation for the bus delay can be found in Eqs. A.14, A.15 and A.16 in Appendix A. To visualize the car and bus delays described above and depicted in Fig. 4, an example for the total additional car delays and bus delays as compared to using mixed-lanes is illustrated in Fig. 5 . The thick black line shows the difference between the total car delay with a pre-signal and with mixed-use lanes. The thin black line shows the difference between the theoretical bus delay when pre-signals are used and when mixed-lanes are used (with mixed-lanes, the bus delay is assumed to be equal to the delay of a car arriving at that time). Note that the additional bus delays are negative since a pre-signal reduces the expected bus delays (i.e., their absolute value can be considered as the bus time savings due to the pre-signal). These values are plotted against all possible bus arrival times to the pre-signal during a cycle for a chosen set of parameters. Note that the seven cases shown here correspond to those seven cases depicted in Fig. 4. While the graph in Fig. 5 was obtained with a specific set of realistic values for the parameters, the shape of the graph is reproducible with other, realistic, values for the parameters. As seen in this figure, the magnitude of the total additional car delays as compared to mixed operations depends highly on the arrival time of the bus to the pre-signal. To obtain the expected total car delay and expected bus delay per cycle, it is assumed that the bus arrivals to the pre-signal are uniformly distributed across the duration of the cycle. Then the expected car delay and the expected bus delay savings are simply the average height of the two curves shown in Fig. 5. The expected car delay and the expected bus delay savings can also be calculated by taking the integral of Eqs. (A.3)\u2013(A.8) and (A.9), and Eqs. A.14, A.15 and A.16, presented in Appendix A, respectively and dividing by the total length of a cycle. 3 Empirical verification To verify the analytical delay models, empirical data from an existing pre-signal in Zurich, Switzerland was collected with the aid of video cameras. The data collection took place along a street where one lane for buses and one lane for cars merge into a single mixed lane to pass through a signalized intersection. A pre-signal is located at the location of the merge to give priority to buses when approaching the main signal. Car departure times from the seven locations shown in Fig. 6 (main signal, side street 1, pre-signal, side street 2, side street 3, side street 4, and upstream measurement location) were collected on four weekdays. 3 The data collection took place on the 25th of September 2012 (Tuesday), 26th of September 2013 (Thursday), 14th of October 2013 (Monday), 14th of November 2013 (Thursday). 3 The data was video recorded, and then manually extracted. The operation of the pre-signal at this location is as described in the previous section. Queued cars at the pre-signal receive a green signal such that the first car in queue arrives to the main signal just as it is turning green. Whenever a bus arrives to the pre-signal the cars receive a red signal and the bus is allowed to merge into the downstream lane. Note that the main difference in the signal operation of this location with that assumed in the previous section is that the signal phasing at the intersection is adaptive, and transit signal priority exists for all approaches. Hence, each individual cycle has different duration and green times. However, during the peak period the cycle length and green times remained nearly constant ( C = 52 s and G = 27 s ). From the measured departure times, transformed cumulative curves of car arrivals to the upstream location, the pre-signal and the main signal were constructed. To do so, the counts at each location were shifted by the free flow travel time to the intersection (as in Daganzo, 1997; Cassidy and Windover, 1995). Shifted counts from the side streets were also added to the upstream and pre-signal counts when necessary. During the period of data collection on several occasions a queue persisted for multiple cycles (this was observed even during off-peak hours due to the fluctations in demand). These cycles were not considered in the total delay calculations since the analytical formulas presented in Appendix A only hold for under-saturated conditions. The car delay is separated into two parts: (1) the delay encountered upstream of the pre-signal, and (2) the delay encountered between the pre-signal and the main signal. These two components of delay are reported separately for cycles in which buses were present and not present. The measured average car delay per cycle can be seen in Table 1 . These aggregated results are as expected. Average car delays encountered upstream of the pre-signal are greater than average car delays encountered between the pre-signal and the main signal. Also, average total car delays are higher in cycles during which buses are present as compared to cycles during which buses are not present, but this difference is not statistically significant. More detailed results on the empirical data can be found in Guler and Menendez (2013). To compare the empirical results to the theoretical formulations, the same delay components are analytically calculated using the framework presented in Section 2. The values of parameters used for the theoretical calculations are estimated from the video data both for cycles during which buses are present and for cycles during which buses are not present. These values can be found in Table 2 . Please note that despite the presence of transit signal priority at the main signal, the cycle length and red time for cycles during which buses are present is longer than for cycles during which buses are not present. This could be due to buses that run on the cross street also receiving priority at the signalized intersection. The expected theoretical delays are calculated using the formulation presented in Appendix A and modified to represent the stochastic nature of real world car arrivals according to (Webster, 1958). Table 3 shows the analytical predictions for each delay component that is deterministic and the contribution of delay due to stochastic car arrivals computed using Webster\u2019s formula. Comparing Tables 1 and 3 it can be seen that the analytical formulations performed quite well, and the total average delay obtained with the analytical formulations are similar to that observed in reality for each of the two scenarios (with bus present and without bus present). From the empirical results, the delay encountered between the pre-signal and the main signal account for 23% and 27% of the average car delay for cycles during which buses are not present, and buses are present, respectively. The corresponding values from the analytical results are 19% and 23%, respectively. The analytical formulations under predict the delay encountered between the pre-signal and the main signal, mostly because the analytical models cannot capture the effects of cars turning onto the main street from side street 1, and also because turning maneuvers at the main signal lead to increased delays at this location. Comparing the total delay, the error of the predicted total delay is \u22122% when buses are not present, and \u22121% when buses are present. These results show that the analytical formulations can predict the expected car delays with high accuracy. Also, the observed average bus delay was 10.8s as compared to 9.1s found analytically. The next step is to verify the delay associated with the individual cases presented in Section 2. Notice that the layout for the pre-signal found at the data collection site is different than the general layout presented in Fig. 1. At the pre-signal in the data collection site the number of lanes reduces from two to one. With this layout, cases 3 and 4 presented in Fig. 4 do not exist; and cases 2, 6 and 7 span very short durations. Therefore, it was not possible to observe each individual case during the data collection. Hence, the empirical data for cycles during which buses were present were broken down into two categories: (1) Cases 1\u20132, and (2) Cases 5\u20137. For the specific configuration of lanes at this data collection location, these two categories correspond to the arrival of a bus during a red pre-signal and a green pre-signal, respectively. Using these two categories, the comparison of the empirically observed delays to the theoretically predicted ones is shown in Table 4 . It can be seen that even when the data is broken down into further detail the predicted average delays are within 10% of those empirically observed. The average delay in cases 1\u20132 is under predicted with the developed formulation, while in cases 5\u20137 it is over predicted. The over prediction is expected since the analytical formulations assume a continuum of cars, and at the end of a cycle a fraction of a car can be forced to wait until the next cycle while in reality this is impossible. However, it would be expected that if many more data points were to be collected the discrete results observed in real life and the continuum approximation used in theory would converge towards each other. Overall, the results of the empirical study show that the analytical models are a good predictor for the expected delay when pre-signals are used. It is also interesting to note that, even though transit signal priority strategies are used in real life, the realized bus delays are still greater than the analytical predictions. While the analytical predictions are not perfect, the results imply that they would be useful for comparisons of different bus and car operating strategies (e.g., mixed use lanes vs. pre-signals) at signalized intersections. This comparison is discussed in the following section. 4 Domains of application We now compare the total person hours of delays of the system (buses and cars) associated with three different strategies for operating multi-modal traffic at an intersection: (a) mixed-use lanes, where all lanes approaching the intersection can be used by both buses and cars; (b) dedicated bus lane, where one lane is dedicated for bus-use only and the remaining lanes are for car-use and; (c) pre-signals as depicted in Fig. 1. It is assumed that a ratio, o bc , between bus occupancy and car occupancy exists. Then the system-wide total person hours of delays can simply be calculated as the car occupancy multiplied by the sum of the expected bus delay per cycle multiplied by o bc , and the expected total car delay per cycle. Calculating the system-wide total person hours of delays in this fashion allows for the comparisons across different strategies to only be a function of the ratio o bc . To determine the domains of application of the strategies, this system-wide total person hours of delay will be compared across the three different operating configurations. To do so the analytical formulations of Section 2 will be used. Note that there might be some error involved in the delay predictions for all three operating strategies. However, even after the empirical validation of the delay predictions for the pre-signal strategy, the errors associated with the delay predictions for the remaining two strategies are not known. Since the errors associated with the pre-signal strategy presented in Section 3 were small and similar for the two cases when buses were present or were not present, it is assumed here that analytical models for all strategies would have small and similar errors. Therefore, while there will be a range around the bounds presented in this section, this is assumed to be negligible. The system-wide total person hours of delay will only be compared for cycles in which a bus is present (corresponding to 45 buses/h, which would be considered a high bus flow for a single line). This is a conservative assumption since in cycles where buses are not present the total car delays are the same for mixed-use lanes and pre-signals and both are lower than that for dedicated bus lanes. Fig. 7 plots as a function of upstream car demand the o bc for which the system-wide delays would be the same using either mixed-use lanes or pre-signals (dashed line) and using either pre-signals or dedicated lanes (solid line). Note that, for a fair comparison amongst the different strategies, the demand values are chosen such that even with a dedicated bus lane the main signal would remain under-saturated. Below the solid black line pre-signals provide lower system-wide delays than dedicated bus lanes. Above the dashed line pre-signals provide lower system-wide delays than mixed-use lanes. Therefore between the solid and dashed lines, a pre-signal strategy should be preferred to the two other strategies to minimize the system-wide person hours of delays. As can be seen in Fig. 7 this result is observed for a wide range of o bc values (10\u201370) which is a typical range of bus occupancies that can be expected in reality. Notice that car occupancies are often close to 1, and hardly ever larger than 2. 5 Conclusions This paper developed tools to analytically evaluate interactions between buses and cars. While the operation of buses and cars individually is well understood in the literature, there is only a small amount of work looking at how the operation of these modes can affect each other. To this end, this paper developed an analytical framework using traffic flow theory tools to evaluate the use of pre-signals to resolve conflicts between buses and cars at signalized intersections. This analytical framework resulted in formulations of expected car and bus delays when pre-signals are used. Then, the theoretical framework was tested against real world operations through empirical data collection in Zurich, Switzerland. The results showed that the theoretical formulas can predict the delay encountered in real life with a small error (\u223c2% for total delays, \u223c10% for individual cases). These results give the authors confidence that analytical comparisons between different operating strategies of cars and buses will provide valuable insights. Three operating strategies, mixed-use lanes, dedicated lanes and pre-signals were compared to gain an understanding on the performance of buses and cars with each strategy. The domains of application for when each strategy will provide the lowest system-wide person hours of delay was then determined. These results unveiled a wide, and realistic range of bus occupancies (10\u201370 passengers) and car demands for which pre-signals provide the lowest system-wide delays. The authors hope that this paper contributes to the wide utilization of pre-signals in urban environments as these findings suggest that pre-signals can be appealing for a broad range of situations. Notice that, in this work the use of transit signal priority was not considered. However, the authors expect that with the use of transit signal priority the bus delays for dedicated lanes and pre-signals would decrease in a similar manner, and that this effect would be much lower for mixed-use lanes. These intuitions will be tested using simulation in the future. However, the authors expect that the comparisons of different strategies and the results for the domains of application should remain similar even when transit signal priority is available. In this paper the values of car demand considered are such that the main signal would always remain under-saturated if dedicated bus lanes were used. Considering slightly higher demand values such that the main signal would be over-saturated if dedicated lanes were, but under-saturated if mixed-lanes or a pre-signal strategy is used, would only increase the applicable range of a pre-signal strategy. This is true since in this case the upper-bound of bus occupancies for which a pre-signal strategy would provide lower total person hours of delay as compared against dedicated bus lanes (solid line Fig. 7) would increase. The lower-bound of bus occupancies for which a pre-signal strategy would provide lower total person hours of delay as compared to using mixed-lanes (dashed line in Fig. 7) would remain the same. However, further analysis is necessary to determine the impact of pre-signals for demand values that are high enough such that the main signal would become over-saturated when mixed-use lanes or a pre-signal strategy is used. For that it will be necessary to evaluate how the lower-bound of bus occupancies for which a pre-signal strategy would provide lower total person hours of delay as compared to using mixed-lanes would change. The benefits of implementing pre-signals is not only limited to improving bus operations, and reducing system-wide person hours of delays for a wide range of bus occupancies. If done properly, pre-signals could also reduce delays and increase reliability of buses to help promote the more sustainable bus mode. Induced demand for the bus mode and some mode shift from cars to buses could be expected then in the long term. Overall, as more users shift to the greener mode, the transportation system of the city could move toward becoming more environmentally sustainable. Appendix A Additional delay due to a pre-signal The equations for additional car and bus delays defined in Section 2 and illustrated in Fig. 4 are shown in this section. All equations are derived using the variables defined in Section 2. Geometric relations are used to calculate the gray shaded and hatched areas shown in Fig. 4. To simplify the equations two variables, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are defined (Eq. (A.1)). (A.1a) \u03b1 = q s q s - q a (A.1b) \u03b2 = q s \u2032 q s \u2032 - q a Using Eq. (A.1) and Fig. 3 the reader can verify that: (A.2) r ps = \u03b1 \u03b2 \u00b7 r ms Eqs. (A.3)\u2013(A.8) and (A.9) define the additional delays experienced by cars in a cycle due to the activation of the pre-signal, d car , for a given arrival time of the bus, t bus which falls into one of the seven cases defined in Section 2. This delay corresponds to the gray shaded areas shown in Fig. 4. \u2022 Case 1: 0 < t bus < r ps - r b (A.3) d car = 0 \u2022 Case 2: r ps - r b < t bus < r ps (A.4) d car = 1 2 \u00b7 ( r b + t bus - r ps ) \u00b7 \u03b2 \u00b7 q a \u00b7 ( r b + t bus ) - q s \u2032 \u00b7 q s \u00b7 ( r ms - r b - t bus ) q s - q s \u2032 \u2022 Case 3: r ps < t bus < r ms \u00b7 q s - r ps \u00b7 q s \u2032 - r b \u00b7 q s q s - q s \u2032 (A.5) d car = 1 2 \u00b7 r b \u00b7 \u03b2 \u00b7 q a \u00b7 ( r b + r ps ) - q s \u2032 \u00b7 q s \u00b7 ( r ms - r b - r ps ) q s - q s \u2032 \u2022 Case 4: r ms \u00b7 q s - r ps \u00b7 q s \u2032 - r b \u00b7 q s q s - q s \u2032 < t bus < \u03b1 \u00b7 r ms (A.6) d car = 1 2 \u00b7 2 \u00b7 q s \u2032 \u00b7 r b \u00b7 ( r ps \u00b7 \u03b2 - t bus ) + \u03b2 \u00b7 q a \u00b7 r b 2 + q s \u2032 q s \u00b7 ( q s \u2032 - q s ) \u00b7 ( r ps \u00b7 \u03b2 - t bus ) 2 \u2022 Case 5: \u03b1 \u00b7 r ms < t bus < C - \u03b2 \u00b7 r b (A.7) d car = 1 2 \u00b7 \u03b2 \u00b7 q a \u00b7 r b 2 \u2022 Case 6: C - \u03b2 \u00b7 r b < t bus < C - r b (A.8) d car = 1 2 \u00b7 q s \u2032 \u00b7 ( r b \u00b7 \u03b2 - C + t bus ) \u03b2 2 \u00b7 \u03b1 - \u03b2 q a + 2 \u00b7 r ps \u00b7 q s \u2032 \u00b7 ( r b \u00b7 \u03b2 - C + t bus ) + q a \u00b7 \u03b2 \u00b7 r b 2 \u2022 Case 7: C - r b < t bus < C (A.9) d car = 1 2 \u00b7 q a \u00b7 \u03b1 \u00b7 ( C - t bus ) ( 2 \u00b7 r ms + C - t bus ) Eqs. (A.10)\u2013(A.12) and (A.13) define the additional delays experienced by cars in a cycle due to the gap created by the bus at the main signal, d car \u2217 , for a given arrival time of the bus, t bus , which falls into one of the seven cases defined in Section 2. This delay corresponds to the hatched areas shown in Fig. 4. \u2022 Case 1: 0 < t bus < r ps - r b (A.10) d car \u2217 = 1 2 \u00b7 q a \u00b7 \u03b1 \u00b7 t add \u00b7 ( 2 r ms + t add ) \u2022 Case 2: r ps - r b < t bus < r ps : (A.11) d car \u2217 = t add \u00b7 s \u00b7 q s \u2032 q s - q s \u2032 r ms - r b - t bus + t add 2 \u2022 Case 3: r ps < t bus < r ms \u00b7 q s - r ps \u00b7 q s \u2032 - r b \u00b7 q s q s - q s \u2032 (A.12) d car \u2217 = t add \u00b7 q s \u00b7 q s \u2032 ( q s - q s \u2032 ) \u00b7 r ms - r b - r ps + t add 2 - ( t b - r ps ) \u00b7 q s - q s \u2032 q s \u2022 Cases 4, 5, 6 and 7: r ms \u00b7 q s - r ps \u00b7 q s \u2032 - r b \u00b7 q s q s - q s \u2032 < t bus < C (A.13) d car \u2217 = 0 The delay a single bus encounters when arriving at time t bus , d bus , can be calculated using the following equations: \u2022 Cases 1 and 2: 0 < t bus < r ps (A.14) d bus = r ms - t bus \u2022 Cases 3 and 4: r ps < t bus < \u03b1 \u00b7 r ms (A.15) d bus = t bus - r ps \u00b7 q s \u2032 q s + r ms - t bus \u2022 Cases 5, 6 and 7: \u03b1 \u00b7 r ms < t bus < C (A.16) d bus = 0 Note that these cases arise only if the following conditions hold: \u2022 C > \u03b1 \u00b7 r ms + \u03b2 \u00b7 r b \u2022 r ms - r ps > r b \u2022 r ps > r b If the first condition is not met, case 5 would not arise, and if C is small enough case 6 would not arise either. In either situation, the equations for case 6 or case 7, respectively would be modified. However, these modifications can easily be done by following the logic of the cases presented above. If the second condition does not hold, case 3 would not arise and the equations for case 4 would need to be modified. The third condition would not be violated for any realistic traffic intersection.
