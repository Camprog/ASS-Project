"Transportation Research Part B: MethodologicalPlanning facility location under generally correlated facility disruptions: Use of supporting stations and quasi-probabilitiesAbstract Many real-world service facilities are subject to probabilistic disruptions. Such disruptions often exhibit correlations that arise from shared external hazards or direct interactions among these facilities. This paper builds an overarching methodological framework for reliable facility location design under correlated facility disruptions. We first incorporate and extend the concepts of supporting station structure and quasi-probability from Li et al. (2013) and Xie et al. (2015), such that any correlated facility disruptions (positive and/or negative) can be equivalently represented by independent failures of a layer of properly constructed supporting stations, which are virtually added to the original facility system for capturing the effect of correlations among facilities. We then develop a compact mixed-integer mathematical model to optimize the facility location and customer assignment decisions in order to strike a balance between system reliability and cost efficiency. Lagrangian relaxation based algorithms, including modules for obtaining upper bound and lower bounds of relaxed subproblems, are proposed to effectively solve the optimization model. Numerical case studies are carried out to demonstrate the methodology, to test the performance of the framework, and to draw managerial insights.serial JL 271728 291210 291772 291817 31 Transportation Research Part B: Methodological TRANSPORTATIONRESEARCHPARTBMETHODOLOGICAL 2019-02-20 2019-02-20 2019-02-20 2019-02-20 2019-03-29T16:43:33 1-s2.0-S0191261518302467 S0191-2615(18)30246-7 S0191261518302467 10.1016/j.trb.2019.02.001 S300 S300.1 FULL-TEXT 1-s2.0-S0191261519X0003X 2019-03-29T21:42:44.05292Z 0 0 20190401 20190430 2019 2019-02-20T19:47:45.846906Z articleinfo articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright crossmark dateloaded dateloadedtxt datesearch datesort dateupdated dco docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid indexeddate issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdateend pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sectiontitle sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype ssids alllist content subj subheadings suppl tomb volfirst volissue volumelist webpdf webpdfpagecount yearnav figure table body mmlmath acknowledge affil appendices articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authkeywords authlast footnotes highlightsabst primabst ref 0191-2615 01912615 true 122 122 C Volume 122 7 115 139 115 139 201904 April 2019 2019-04-01 2019-04-30 2019 Research papers article fla \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract Many real-world service facilities are subject to probabilistic disruptions. Such disruptions often exhibit correlations that arise from shared external hazards or direct interactions among these facilities. This paper builds an overarching methodological framework for reliable facility location design under correlated facility disruptions. We first incorporate and extend the concepts of supporting station structure and quasi-probability from Li et al. (2013) and Xie et al. (2015), such that any correlated facility disruptions (positive and/or negative) can be equivalently represented by independent failures of a layer of properly constructed supporting stations, which are virtually added to the original facility system for capturing the effect of correlations among facilities. We then develop a compact mixed-integer mathematical model to optimize the facility location and customer assignment decisions in order to strike a balance between system reliability and cost efficiency. Lagrangian relaxation based algorithms, including modules for obtaining upper bound and lower bounds of relaxed subproblems, are proposed to effectively solve the optimization model. Numerical case studies are carried out to demonstrate the methodology, to test the performance of the framework, and to draw managerial insights. Keywords Facility location Disruption Correlation Station structure Quasi-probability Lagrangian relaxation 1 Introduction Facility location problems have been studied for decades in a variety of forms. Most classic models employ discrete optimization techniques to determine facility location and customer assignment decisions that minimize the total system costs or maximize the utility of these facilities (Drezner, 1995; Daskin, 2013). In recent years, natural and anthropogenic disasters repeatedly caused severe damages to built facilities and have resulted in catastrophic disasters. When a facility is disrupted, all customers originally assigned to this facility have to either be reassigned to a surviving alternative (and bear higher transportation costs), or lose service (and incur certain penalty costs). Ignoring the possibility of facility disruptions during system planning could lead to a suboptimal design that is vulnerable to even infrequent disruptions (Snyder and Daskin, 2005; Li and Ouyang, 2010). In the reliable facility location literature, one stream of studies focused on design-related facility disruptions that can be prevented by fortification. Interdiction models were often used to identify critical components in an infrastructure system, and cost-effective fortification strategies were sought during facility location design. Church et al. (2004), for example, proposed two models for the r-interdiction median problem and the r-interdiction covering problem (which are variants to the p-median problem and the max covering problem, respectively), to identify the most critical facilities in a supply chain. Brown et al. (2005) described several bi-level and tri-level attacker-defender models to address system vulnerability and robustness issues in the contexts of electric power grids, subways, airports and other critical infrastructures. Scaparra and Church (2008b) reformulated the r-interdiction median problem (with fortification) as a maximal covering model with precedence constraints, and aimed at identifying a subset of facilities to fortify so as to best protect the system against the worst-case loss of non-fortified facilities. This model was later extended by Liberatore et al. (2011) to a stochastic version, which optimally allocated defense resources among facilities to minimize the worst-case impact of a randomized intentional disruption. Scaparra and Church (2008a) presented a bi-level formulation based on the classical p-median problem. The upper level problem involved decisions on which facilities to fortify in order to minimize the worst-case efficiency reduction due to loss of unprotected facilities, while the lower-level interdiction problem described the worst-case losses. Another stream of research focused on modeling the expected consequences of location-specific facility disruptions. A comprehensive review can be found in Snyder (2006). Among a rich variety of efforts, Snyder and Daskin (2005) and Berman et al. (2009) formulated models where facilities are subject to independent disruptions with identical failure probabilities. More recently, a series of reliable location models were proposed to allow site-dependent disruption probabilities. Berman et al. (2007) provided a nonlinear mixed-integer programming formulation as well as an efficient heuristic solution approach. Cui et al. (2010) developed two distinct sets of models (discrete and continuous) and corresponding solution algorithms to allow the disruption probabilities to be site-dependent. O\u2019Hanley et al. (2013) proposed a modeling technique based on a customized flow network to linearize the unreliable p-median facility location problems. Atamt\u00fcrk et al. (2012) further presented reliable location-inventory models (which allowed facilities to be subject to failures due to inventory shortage) as well as an innovative conic programming solution approach. Zhang et al. (2016) considered the cost savings from inventory risk-pooling and economies of scale under homogeneous and heterogeneous disruption probabilities. All these studies provided insightful knowledge on reliable location problems, but they held the assumption on independent facility disruptions, which may not always be realistic, as various types of connections and interactions may exist among built facilities in the real world. As a result, facility disruptions could be correlated when the facilities are exposed to shared hazards or mutual interactions. Such correlations could be positive or negative, or mixed. For example, adjacent facilities in a local geographical region are prone to simultaneous damage by a natural disaster (e.g., earthquake, hurricane, flooding). If one facility is known to have been disrupted by an earthquake, its neighboring facilities will bear a higher likelihood of being disrupted as well \u2013 this shows a positive correlation. The correlation can also be negative. Suppose multiple facilities along a river are all threatened by flooding. If one facility is known to have been disrupted by flooding, then its downstream peers become less likely to be disrupted due to the release of water pressure. Similar negative correlations may also exist when facilities compete for scarce resources. Disruption correlation tends to have a strong impact on the performance of a reliable facility location design. Consider a simple network where two facilities A and B jointly serve one unit of demand from a customer. The costs for serving the demand from these two facilities are 10 and 20 units, respectively, and the penalty for not serving the demand is 100 units. When both facilities are perfectly reliable, the demand will obviously be served by A with a total cost of 10 units. When the facilities are subject to disruption, the demand will be served by A as long as A is functioning (i.e., event A), or by B if A is disrupted but B is functioning (i.e., event A \u00af B ), or the customer will bear the penalty if both A and B fail (i.e., event A B \u00af ). In the case where A and B fail independently with an equal probability of 0.5, the expected service cost is 10 \u00d7 ( 0.5 ) + 20 \u00d7 ( 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 ) + 100 \u00d7 ( 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 ) = 35 units. If the facility disruptions are positively correlated, say P ( A B ) = P ( A B \u00af ) = 0.4 , P ( A \u00af B ) = P ( A B \u00af ) = 0.1 , the expected service cost becomes 10 \u00d7 ( 0.1 + 0.4 ) + 20 \u00d7 0.1 + 100 \u00d7 0.4 = 47 units. If the facility disruptions are negatively correlated, say P ( A B ) = P ( A B \u00af ) = 0.1 , P ( A \u00af B ) = P ( A B \u00af ) = 0.4 , the expected service cost becomes 10 \u00d7 ( 0.1 + 0.4 ) + 20 \u00d7 0.4 + 100 \u00d7 0.1 = 23 units. Although the marginal failure probability of each facility remains 0.5 in all three cases, we can see that positive disruption correlation significantly increases the expected service cost, while negative correlation does the contrary. This simple example demonstrates the significant impact of correlations that has recently been reported in the existing literature (Li and Ouyang, 2010; Liberatore et al., 2012). There are many ways to express the correlations among facility disruptions. Xie et al. (2015) showed equivalence of three general correlation representations using scenario, marginal, or conditional probabilities. Sometimes the correlations follow explicit physical laws and take special forms. For example, under certain natural disasters (such as earthquakes), the correlation between two candidate locations could sometimes be specified by a decaying probability of failure \u201ccontagion\u201d (e.g., e \u2212 d i s t a n c e ) that depends on their relative distance. No matter how correlations are specified, however, a very straightforward modeling approach in the reliable facility location literature would involve some type of enumeration (or simulation and sampling) of an exponential number of random scenarios; this makes it computationally difficult to even just evaluate the performance of a given design. To the best of our knowledge, only a few efforts have been made to address correlated facility disruptions, either exactly or approximately (e.g., Liberatore et al. (2011); Li and Ouyang (2010); Lu et al. (2015); An et al. (2018)). In addition, Huang et al. (2010) addressed a variant of the p-center model in case of large-scale emergencies, where correlated disruption was introduced by allowing many facilities to become functionless simultaneously. Gueye and Menezes (2015) considered a two-stage stochastic program model for a median problem under correlated facility disruptions, and asymptotic results were presented based on a scenario-based model formulation. Berman and Krass (2011) and Berman et al. (2013) introduced analytical approaches to help understand the effects of correlated failures in simpler spatial settings, e.g., along a line segment. Li et al. (2013) proposed a virtual station structure that transforms a facility network with correlated disruptions into an equivalent one with added virtual supporting stations, and the virtual stations were assumed to be subject to independent disruptions. While an optimization model was developed, it can only handle cases where facilities are positively correlated, and the station disruption probabilities are all identical. Based on Li et al. (2013), Xie and Ouyang (2019) presented an optimization framework for reliable facility location problem under the risk of network access failures, in which facilities are correlated as they share common access points. The concept of supporting station is used to represent the network access points and to describe the system behaviors. Recently, Xie et al. (2015) extended the network transformation theory in Li et al. (2013) by developing a recipe for any (positive, negative, or mixed) type of correlations to be transformed into an augmented network (with additional supporting stations). It was proven that with such a station structure, a system of interdependent facilities with generally correlated disruptions can be equivalently represented by one with independent stations, whereas each station fails with a \u201cfailure propensity\u201d which \u201cinherits all mathematical characteristics and properties of a failure probability except that we allow it to be larger than 1\u201d (Xie et al., 2015). 1 1 In theoretical physics and especially quantum mechanics, a similar concept is sometimes called \u201cquasi-probability\u201d (e.g., Dirac (1942); Feynman (1987)), where \u201cconditional probabilities and probabilities of imagined intermediary states may be negative in a calculation of probabilities of physical events or states. ... The other possibility is that the situation for which the probability appears to be negative is not one that can be verified directly\u201d (Feynman, 1987). How to optimally design the reliable location of service facilities under site-dependent failures and positive/negative/mixed correlations, however, remains an open and nontrivial question. In light of these challenges, we build upon the idea of supporting station structure (Li et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2015), so as to address the reliable facility location problem with any pattern of facility disruption correlations. An additional layer of independent yet heterogeneous supporting stations are incorporated into the service design framework. These stations, when properly connected to (and shared by) the candidate facility locations, collectively dictate the functioning state of built facilities at these locations and exactly capture the effect of correlated facility disruptions. The probability of the virtual station state (called \u201cpropensity\u201d in Xie et al. (2015), but will be now referred to as quasi-probability so as to be consistent with the physics literature) may exceed unity or be negative for the purpose of calculating the final probabilities of physical disruption scenarios of the facilities. Similar to Feynman (1987), we introduce these quasi-probabilities to quantify the imagined intermediary states of added virtual stations (whose values may exceed unity or be negative), so as to systematically calculate the ultimate probabilities of physical facility states (whose values are ensured to be within the conventional range [0, 1]); more about these properties will be explained in Section 2.2 and Proposition 5. As a result, the optimization model developed in this paper, which transfers correlated disruptions of facilities to independent disruptions of such stations, is capable of addressing the facility location problem equivalently. A compact mixed-integer mathematical model is proposed to determine the optimal facility location and customer assignment plans. Several customized solution approaches based on Lagrangian relaxation, with careful treatment of negative and mixed correlations, are also developed. Case studies involving multiple patterns of correlations are conducted to demonstrate the performance and applicability of our methodology. Managerial insights are drawn as well. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the station-based mixed-integer mathematical model for the reliable facility location problem under correlated facility disruptions. Section 3 presents the customized solution approaches to efficiently solve the optimization model. In Section 4, a range of case studies involving multiple patterns of correlations are shown. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses future research directions. 2 Model formulation This section first presents the traditional scenario-based formulation of the reliable facility location problem under correlated facility disruptions. Then, after a brief introduction of using station structure to represent correlated facility disruptions (Xie et al., 2015), the scenario-based reliable facility location model is transformed into an equivalent station-based model. 2.1 Scenario-based formulation We denote I as the set of discrete customers, and each customer i \u2208 I has a demand \u03bci . We define J to be the set of discrete candidate facility locations, and associate each location j \u2208 J with a fixed facility cost fj . The cost for a facility at location j to satisfy one unit of demand from customer i is denoted by dij . Customers can go to candidate location j \u2208 J for service if a facility is built and no disruption has occurred there. Under any realization of the facility states, each customer i seeks service by visiting the available and functioning facility that has the smallest transportation cost. Moreover, a penalty cost \u03c0i per unit demand will be imposed if customer i does not receive any service. This situation occurs if no facility is reachable, or if the cost of serving customer i by the nearest available facility already exceeds \u03c0i . We model this possibility by adding an \u201cemergency\u201d facility index by j = 0 with fixed cost f 0 = 0 and transportation costs d i 0 = \u03c0 i , \u2200 i \u2208 I . Let \u03a9 = { 0 , 1 } | J | be the set of all possible disruption scenarios/realizations if facilities were built at all candidate locations (including the \u201cemergency\u201d facility). For each \u03c9\u202f\u2208\u202f\u03a9, which occurs with probability p\u03c9 , we use parameter \u03b4 j \u03c9 = 1 to indicate that the facility at j (if built) is functioning in scenario \u03c9, or 0 otherwise. The emergency facility is assumed to be always functioning, i.e., \u03b4 0 \u03c9 = 1 , \u2200 \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 . We denote Xj and Yij\u03c9 as binary variables indicating whether a facility is built at location j, and whether customer i visits facility j in scenario \u03c9, respectively. Specifically, X j = { 1 if a facility is built at location j ; 0 otherwise. Y i j \u03c9 = { 1 if customer i visits facility j in scenario \u03c9 ; 0 otherwise. Then it is straightforward to see that the reliable facility location problem could be formulated as the following scenario-based formulation (RFL-SCE): (1a) ( RFL-SCE ) min \u2211 j \u2208 J f j X j + \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } \u2211 \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 \u03bc i d i j Y i j \u03c9 p \u03c9 (1b) s.t. \u2211 j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } Y i j \u03c9 = 1 , \u2200 i \u2208 I , \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 , (1c) Y i j \u03c9 \u2264 \u03b4 j \u03c9 X j , \u2200 i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J , \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 , (1d) X j , Y i j \u03c9 \u2208 { 0 , 1 } , \u2200 i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } , \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 . The objective (1a) is the summation of the fixed facility costs and the expected transportation costs (including the penalty costs) across all possible facility disruption scenarios. Constraints (1b) enforce that in any disruption scenario \u03c9\u202f\u2208\u202f\u03a9, each customer i is either assigned to a regular facility or assigned to the emergency facility. Constraints (1c) require each customer to be assigned to only a functioning open facility. Given a problem with correlated disruptions at | J | candidate locations, the total number of possible scenarios that need to be enumerated is 2 | J | . This implies that formulation (RFL-SCE), which is an integer program, requires an exponential number of variables and constraints; thus it is extremely difficult to solve, if not impossible. So in the next sections, we introduce a supporting station structure as well as an alternative station-based formulation that is more compact in size and can be solved more efficiently. 2.2 Supporting station structure Given set J , the set of all possible disruption scenarios \u03a9 and their probabilities {p\u03c9 } \u03c9\u202f\u2208\u202f\u03a9 can be expressed in either of the following two mathematical representations (Xie et al., 2015): (i) scenario representation S = { p J S } \u2200 J \u2286 J , where p J S = p \u03c9 if \u03c9 satisfies \u03b4 j \u03c9 = 0 , \u2200 j \u2208 J & \u03b4 j \u03c9 = 1 , \u2200 j \u2208 J \u2216 J , which denotes the probability for all locations in J to be disrupted while all others are functioning; and (ii) marginal representation M = { p J M } \u2200 J \u2286 J , where p J M = \u2211 \u03c9 : \u03b4 j \u03c9 = 0 , \u2200 j \u2208 J p \u03c9 , which denotes the probability for all locations in J to be disrupted regardless of the states of all other locations. Here, the disruption of a candidate location j \u2208 J implies that a facility will be disrupted if built at location j. In the rest of this paper, when we describe facility disruptions, we may use the phrases \u201cdisruptions of facilities\u201d and \u201cdisruptions of candidate locations\u201d interchangeably. Two sets of facilities J 1 , J 2 \u2286 J are independent if p J 1 M \u00b7 p J 2 M = p J 1 \u222a J 2 M . In many real-world systems, facility disruptions exhibit spatial correlations (e.g., due to shared hazards), and there exist J 1 , J 2 \u2286 J such that p J 1 M \u00b7 p J 2 M \u2260 p J 1 \u222a J 2 M while J 1 \u2229 J 2 = \u2205 . When facility disruptions are correlated as shown in Fig. 1 (a), multiple facilities are subject to simultaneous impacts, and describing the correlation would typically require enumerating an exponential number of probabilities by specifying the scenario/marginal representation (e.g., (RFL-SCE) enumerates 2 | J | scenarios). To circumvent this complexity, a virtual supporting station structure has been proposed to transform an arbitrary probabilistic representation of correlated facility disruptions into an equivalent representation with only independent disruptions (Li et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2015). To build a station structure, a set of virtual stations, denoted by K , are attached to the set of facilities, as shown in Fig. 1(b). A station k \u2208 K could be connected to multiple facilities, and we use a binary parameter l k j = 1 to indicate that facility j is connected to station k, or l k j = 0 otherwise. We further assume that each station is associated with a non-negative site-dependent disruption quasi-probability qk \u202f\u2208\u202f[0, \u221e) (which used to be referred to as \u201cpropensity\u201d in Xie et al., 2015). The larger this quasi-probability value, the more damaging that station is to its connected facilities. When the disruption quasi-probability of a station exceeds 1, it simply means that the station\u2019s \u201cfunctioning\u201d probability is negative and it only causes pure damage to the connected facilities. This concept, similar to those in Feynman (1987), is used merely to quantify the imagined intermediary states of virtual stations in calculation of probabilities of states of physical facilities. Each station itself is also in a binary state: functioning or disrupted. The basic mechanism of the augmented facility-station system is defined as follows: a facility remains operational if and only if at least one of its connected stations is functioning. Hence the operating state of the facility system is determined collectively by the states of all stations. For example, in Fig. 1(b), j 1 and j 2 are disrupted and j 3 is functioning if and only if stations k {1}, k {2}, k {1,2}, k {1,3}, k {2,3}, k {1,2,3} are all disrupted and k {3} is functioning. Here kJ is the station connected to all and only facility locations in J; i.e., l k J j = 1 , \u2200 j \u2208 J and l k J j = 0 , \u2200 j \u2209 J . Following this mechanism, we can ensure that the probability of a disruption scenario is equal to the product of qk for each corresponding disrupted station k, and ( 1 \u2212 q k ) for each functioning station k. For example, in Fig. 1(b), p { 1 , 2 } S = q k { 1 } q k { 2 } q k { 1 , 2 } q k { 1 , 3 } q k { 2 , 3 } q k { 1 , 2 , 3 } ( 1 \u2212 q k { 3 } ) . To summarize, per Proposition 1 of Xie et al. (2015), we have the following: Proposition 1 ( Xie et al., 2015 ). For a given station structure K with { q k } \u2200 k \u2208 K , the scenario and marginal probabilistic disruption representations are formulated respectively as (2) p J S = \u2211 J 1 : J \u2286 J 1 ( \u2212 1 ) | J 1 | \u2212 | J | [ \u220f J 2 : J 2 \u2229 J 1 \u2260 \u2205 q k J 2 ] , \u2200 J \u2286 J , (3) p J M = \u220f J 1 : J 1 \u2229 J \u2260 \u2205 q k J 1 , \u2200 J \u2286 J . Based on the defined mechanism and Eqs. (2)\u2013(3), any scenario or marginal probabilistic representation can be transformed back into an equivalent station structure representation based on Proposition 4 in Xie et al. (2015): Proposition 2 ( Xie et al., 2015 ). For any J \u2286 J , let J \u00af = J \u2216 J , we can compute the disruption quasi-probability q k J of candidate station kJ as: (4) q k J = \u220f L : J \u00af \u2286 L \u2286 J [ \u2211 J 1 : L \u2286 J 1 p J 1 S ] ( \u2212 1 ) | L | \u2212 | J \u00af | + 1 = \u220f L : J \u00af \u2286 L \u2286 J [ p L M ] ( \u2212 1 ) | L | \u2212 | J \u00af | + 1 . If q k J \u2260 1 , we add a station k and set its associated disruption quasi-probability to be q k J , and connect it to all and only facility locations in J; i.e., let l k j = 1 , \u2200 j \u2208 J and l k j = 0 , \u2200 j \u2209 J . A recipe for systematically constructing the supporting station structure, as proposed in Xie et al. (2015), is presented in Appendix B. 2.3 Size of station structure One may wonder how many stations will be needed to represent a complex correlated disruption profile. Theorem 1 in Xie et al. (2015) states that when the system is generally correlated, the number of needed stations | K | is comparable to the number of scenario probabilities | S | needed to describe the correlation. This statement is corroborated by the numerical examples in Xie et al. (2015). While an exponential value of | K | with respect to the number of facilities | J | (as | S | could possibly be exponential) still makes the problem intractable (even with the introduction of the station structure), we shall note that there often are cases where | S | is exponential but | K | is polynomial (or even linear). Consider the following example that can mimic many service systems in the real world. As shown in Fig. 2 , suppose that N\u202f\u00d7\u202fM facilities (shown as squares) along a line are supported by surrounding stations (e.g., power plants, shown as triangles). The facilities are clustered into N groups, each with M facilities inside the group that are correlated with each other by sharing a set of supporting stations. In addition, in each group, L facilities near each side of the group boundary (i.e., called boundary facilities below) have shared supports with L boundary facilities in the adjacent group. In this system, any disruption scenario (i.e., a subset of facilities failing together) could potentially happen, and the probability of each scenario depends on the state of all facilities. As such, the number of scenario probabilities is | S | = 2 N M . Yet, the relative independence between different facility groups (except for the boundary facilities) jointly show a largely \u201clocal\u201d correlation pattern, and consequently, the number of stations needed to capture said correlation pattern is at most | K | = N ( 2 M \u2212 1 ) + ( N \u2212 1 ) ( 2 2 L \u2212 2 L \u2212 1 ) , which is normally far smaller than | S | . In particular, for the simplest case where M = L = 1 , the number of facility disruption scenarios is 2 N (exponential) while the number of needed stations is only 2 N \u2212 1 (linear). As shown above, when the facility disruptions are \u201clocally\u201d correlated, | K | shall be far smaller than | S | , and the difference between | K | and | S | grows sharply with the level of localness of the correlations (i.e., correlations being confined within a local area). In particular, if the facility system J could be partitioned into N mutually exclusive subsets { J n } n = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , N , such that the facilities within each subset Ji are correlated with one other, while facilities in different subsets are independent, the maximum number of needed stations is | K | \u2264 \u2211 n = 1 N 2 | J n | , which is typically much smaller compared to the maximum number of scenarios that are used/needed to describe the correlation, | S | = 2 | J | . We state this obvious result in the following proposition without proof. Proposition 3 (Exclusive) If J = \u222a n = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , N J n for some N\u202f>\u202f1, such that for all i = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , N , the disruptions of all facilities in Ji are independent of those in J \u2216 J i , then the maximum number of needed stations | K | and the number of scenarios | S | satisfy | K | \u2264 \u2211 n = 1 N 2 | J n | and | S | = 2 \u2211 n = 1 N | J n | , respectively, which further yields | K | | S | \u2264 \u2211 n = 1 N 2 | J n | 2 \u2211 n = 1 N | J n | \u2264 { 1 , if N = 1 (globally correlated) ; \u2211 n = 1 N 2 | J n | 2 | J | , if 2 \u2264 N \u2264 | J | / 2 (locally correlated) . As an example, we consider a facility system J = \u222a n = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , N J n where J i = { 3 i \u2212 2 , 3 i \u2212 1 , 3 i } , and the disruptions of Ji and J \u2216 J i are independent. Each Ji has a system structure as shown in Fig. 1(a), and is subject to the scenario disruption profile in Table B.1. For this particular system J , the total number of scenarios is | S | = ( 2 3 ) N = 8 N , while the number of stations is only | K | = 6 N , which is much smaller than | S | . As such, the formulations we will present in later sections indicate that when N = 4 , a scenario-based formulation would require at least 3 N + 3 N ( 3 N + 1 ) \u00b7 8 N = 638988 binary variables to describe the scenarios, while our proposed formulation will only need at most 3 N + 3 N ( 3 N + 1 ) ( 6 N + 1 ) 6 N = 93612 binary variables. Although Proposition 3 addresses the very special case where correlation among facilities can be divided into disjoint groups, similar relationships between | S | and | K | can be obtained for other cases. The following proposition, for example, shows that when the disruptions are positively correlated (per Definition 1 in Xie et al. (2015)), no station is needed to connect any two independent facilities. Proposition 4 If the facility disruptions are positively correlated per Definition 1 in Xie et al. (2015) ; i.e., \u220f L : J 1 \u2216 { j } \u2286 L \u2286 J \u2216 { j } ( p L M ) ( \u2212 1 ) | L | \u2212 | J 1 | \u2264 \u220f L : J 1 \u2286 L \u2286 J ( p L M ) ( \u2212 1 ) | L | \u2212 | J 1 | + 1 , \u2200 j \u2208 J 1 \u2286 J \u2286 J , then for any two facilities j 1 and j 2 that are independent of each other; i.e., p { j 1 } M \u00b7 p { j 2 } M = p { j 1 , j 2 } M , we have q k J = 1 for any facility set J that contains both j 1 and j 2 . That is, no station is connected to both j 1 and j 2 . Consequently, given pairwise-independent facility sets {Ji }, the process of computing station quasi-probabilities only needs to be conducted within each set Ji, and thus gives the overall computational complexity of O ( \u2211 i = 1 N 2 | J i | ) . Proof For any two facilities j 1 and j 2 that are independent of each other, (3) implies p { j 1 } M = \u220f J : j 1 \u2208 J q k J , p { j 2 } M = \u220f J : j 2 \u2208 J q k J , p { j 1 , j 2 } M = \u220f J : J \u2229 { j 1 , j 2 } \u2260 \u2205 q k J . Substituting these equations into p { j 1 } M \u00b7 p { j 2 } M = p { j 1 , j 2 } M yields \u220f J : j 1 \u2208 J , j 2 \u2208 J q k J = 1 . Proposition 5 in Xie et al. (2015) shows that, when facility disruptions are positively correlated, the disruption quasi-probability for any station k \u2208 K satisfies qk \u202f\u2208\u202f[0, 1]. Then, \u220f J : j 1 \u2208 J , j 2 \u2208 J q k J = 1 implies that q k J = 1 for any facility set J containing both j 1 and j 2. This completes the proof.\u25a1 Proposition 4 is quite revealing; it implies that the number of stations shall be limited if the correlations are local and positive (which often occurs in the real world). For example, consider a chain of N facilities located sequentially in a line, such that any two adjacent facilities are positively correlated while any non-adjacent facilities are mutually independent. In such a system, the maximum number of scenarios is | S | = 2 N , while the maximum number of stations needed to express the correlation is only | K | = 2 N \u2212 1 , which is far smaller than | S | for all N\u202f>\u202f2. In the most special case when facility disruptions are all independent to each other, there exist one-to-one connections between facilities and stations, which implies that | S | = 2 N and | K | = N . The supporting station structure of compact size is now ready to be integrated into a mathematical optimization framework for reliable facility location design under correlated facility disruptions. As we will soon see, the introduction of supporting stations helps avoid enumeration of an exponential number of disruption scenarios (which is necessary in the scenario-based formulation) and reduce the model complexity drastically. 2.4 Station-based formulation In this section, we take advantage of the station structure to propose a new model formulation for the reliable facility location problem under correlated disruptions. Note that the station structure can be specified by { q k } \u2200 k \u2208 K and { l k j } \u2200 j \u2208 J , k \u2208 K , which are constructed from the recipe in Appendix B and used as input data for optimization. With the augmented facility-station system, each customer i now seeks service by visiting its most preferred facility j that is connected to a functioning station k (defined as a station-facility pair (k, j) in the rest of the paper, and a station-facility pair is disrupted if the involved station is disrupted), and if the station k becomes disrupted, the customer will visit the next most preferred pair option, which could be either the same facility j with another functioning station k\u2032, or a different facility j\u2032 with a different functioning station k\u2032. We define R as the maximum number of regular station-facility pairs that a customer can visit, then each customer is assigned to a set of up to ( R \u2212 1 ) backup station-facility pairs as part of the service plan. We assume that all customers have full knowledge of the functioning status of station-facility pairs after the realization of disruption(s), and hence each customer directly visits its serviced station-facility pair that is functioning and has the smallest backup level. Specifically, a customer will visit its level-r station-facility pair if all its level-1, \u2026 , level- ( r \u2212 1 ) pair options have been disrupted. The transportation cost for station-facility pair (k, j) to satisfy one unit of demand from customer i is again denoted by dij . For all i \u2208 I , j 1 , j 2 \u2208 J , we let c i j 1 j 2 = 1 if d i j 1 \u2264 d i j 2 , or 0 otherwise. Note that each customer can be assigned to at most R regular station-facility pairs. In addition to the dummy emergency facility (with index j = 0 ) defined earlier, we further add a dummy emergency station (with index k = 0 ) to allow the \u201cpenalty assignment\u201d, i.e., when a customer loses service. Note that l 00 = 1 and q 0 = 0 , and we set the corresponding transportation cost to be the penalty cost, i.e., d i j | j = 0 = \u03c0 i , \u2200 i \u2208 I . Typically, a customer shall be assigned to station-facility pair (0,0) at level R + 1 as long as regular station-facility pairs are available for backup levels 1 , 2 , \u2026 , R . However, if at some backup level s \u2208 { 1 , 2 , \u2026 , R } , customer i cannot receive service from any station-facility pair (k, j) at a cost less than \u03c0i (per unit demand), it will choose to pay the penalty cost \u03c0i , i.e., visit the emergency station-facility pair at level s. We now need several sets of decision variables. Again, variables X : = { X j } j \u2208 J denote the location decisions as in the scenario-based formulation. The assignment of customers to station-facility pairs at multiple backup levels is specified by Y : = { Y i k j r } i \u2208 I , k \u2208 K \u222a { 0 } , j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } , r \u2208 { 1 , 2 , \u2026 , R + 1 } where Y i k j r = { 1 if customer i is assigned to station-facility pair ( k , j ) at level r ; 0 otherwise. Finally, we define variables Z : = { Z i k j r } i \u2208 I , k \u2208 K \u222a { 0 } , j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } , r \u2208 { 1 , 2 , \u2026 , R + 1 } with Z i k j r \u2208 R denotes the quasi-probability for customer i to be assigned to station-facility pair (k, j) at level r. This could happen only when station k is functioning, station k and facility j are connected, and all the station-facility pairs assigned to customer i at levels 1 , 2 , \u2026 , r \u2212 1 are unavailable. Therefore, the value of Zikjr depends on the assignments of customer i to station-facility pairs at levels 1 , 2 , \u2026 , r \u2212 1 (i.e., { Y i h l s } \u2200 ( h , l ) , s = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , r \u2212 1 ) and the corresponding quasi-probabilities (i.e., { Z i h l s } \u2200 ( h , l ) , s = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , r \u2212 1 ). The reliable facility-location problem under correlated facility disruptions can be formulated as the following station-based mixed-integer programming model (RFL-STA): (5a) ( RFL-STA ) min \u2211 j \u2208 J f j X j + \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 k \u2208 K \u222a { 0 } \u2211 j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } \u2211 r = 1 R + 1 \u03bc i d i j Z i k j r Y i k j r (5b) s.t. \u2211 r = 1 R Y i k j r \u2264 X j , \u2200 i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J , k \u2208 K , (5c) Y i k j r \u2264 l k j , \u2200 i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } , k \u2208 K \u222a { 0 } , r = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , R + 1 , (5d) \u2211 j \u2208 J \u2211 r = 1 R Y i k j r \u2264 1 , \u2200 i \u2208 I , k \u2208 K , (5e) \u2211 r = 1 R + 1 Y i 00 r = 1 , \u2200 i \u2208 I , (5f) \u2211 k \u2208 K \u2211 j \u2208 J Y i k j r + \u2211 s = 1 r Y i 00 s = 1 , \u2200 i \u2208 I , r = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , R + 1 , (5g) Y i k 1 j 1 r \u2264 \u2211 s = 1 r \u2212 1 Y i k 2 j 2 s + c i j 1 j 2 + 2 \u2212 l k 2 j 2 \u2212 [ \u2211 h \u2208 I \u2211 k \u2208 K \u2211 s = 1 R Y h k j 2 s | I \u2225 K | R ] , \u2200 i \u2208 I , j 1 , j 2 \u2208 J , k 1 , k 2 \u2208 K , 2 \u2264 r \u2264 R , (5h) Z i k j 1 = l k j ( 1 \u2212 q k ) , \u2200 i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } , k \u2208 K \u222a { 0 } , (5i) Z i k j r = l k j ( 1 \u2212 q k ) \u00b7 \u2211 k \u2032 \u2208 K \u2211 j \u2032 \u2208 J q k \u2032 1 \u2212 q k \u2032 Z i k \u2032 j \u2032 ( r \u2212 1 ) Y i k \u2032 j \u2032 ( r \u2212 1 ) , \u2200 i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } , k \u2208 K \u222a { 0 } , r = 2 , 3 , \u2026 , R + 1 , (5j) X j , Y i k j r \u2208 { 0 , 1 } , \u2200 i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } , k \u2208 K \u222a { 0 } , r = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , R + 1 . The objective function (5a) presents the expected system cost including the fixed facility cost, the expected total transportation cost, and the expected penalty cost (associated with the dummy station-facility pair). Constraints (5b) and (5c) enforce that customers can only be assigned to station-facility pairs with open facilities. Constraints (5d) make sure that each customer\u2019s assignment will not involve any station at more than one backup level. Constraints (5e) postulate that each customer is assigned to the dummy emergency station-facility pair at a certain backup level, while constraints (5f) require that at each level r, a customer i\u202f\u2208\u202fI is either assigned to a station-facility pair, or has been assigned to the dummy station-facility pair at an earlier level s\u202f\u2264\u202fr. Constraints (5g) enforce that a customer is always assigned to the closest functioning station-facility pair for service; i.e., for any 1\u202f\u2264\u202fr\u202f\u2264\u202fR and two arbitrary station-facility pairs (k 1, j 1), (k 2, j 2) with d i j 2 < d i j 1 , if facility j 2 is built, and a customer i is assigned to (k 1, j 1) at level r, then i should have been assigned to (k 2, j 2) at some level s\u202f<\u202fr. Constraints (5g) ensure equivalence between (RFL-STA) and (RFL-SCE), as we will prove in C.1. Constraints (5h)\u2013(5i) recursively define the values of Zikjr based on the mechanism of the station structure: at level r\u202f>\u202f1, the value of Zikjr equals ( 1 \u2212 q k ) q k \u2032 / ( 1 \u2212 q k \u2032 ) Z i k \u2032 j \u2032 r \u2212 1 if that customer i is assigned to (k\u2032, j\u2032) at level r \u2212 1 . Since quasi-probability qk can take any nonnegative value in [0, \u221e), Zikjr can take any real value in [ M \u00af k , M ^ k ] , where M \u00af k = min \u2200 L \u2286 K \u2216 { k } [ ( 1 \u2212 q k ) \u220f l \u2208 L q l ] , M ^ k = max \u2200 L \u2286 K \u2216 { k } [ ( 1 \u2212 q k ) \u220f l \u2208 L q l ] , \u2200 k \u2208 K . Finally, Constraints (5j) define integrality of the variables. We then show in Proposition 5 below that the above formulation (RFL-STA) correctly captures the key issues associated with the reliable location model under correlated disruptions. Similar to Proposition 1 in Cui et al. (2010), our station-based formulation (RFL-STA), with sufficiently large R, is equivalent to the scenario-based formulation (RFL-SCE). Proposition 5 When R = | K | , the station-based formulation (RFL-STA) with station structure is guaranteed to yield exactly the same optimal objective value and optimal solutions as the scenario-based formulation (RFL-SCE). Proof See Section C.1.\u25a1 If R < | K | , the two formulations are not necessarily equivalent. However, when only a limited number of facilities are built in the optimal solution, if R is as large as the total number of all stations connected to the open facilities, the two formulations are equivalent. Furthermore, as the value of R only influences very high order terms in the formulation, even choosing an R value smaller than | K | would have only a small impact on the optimal location decisions. 2 2 One of the side-effects of the approximate model formulation (with a small R) is that the customers do not necessarily go to the nearest operational facility, but rather they may, at least theoretically, go to a more reliable yet farther one so as to lower the risk of losing service completely. More discussion on this choice can be found in Cui et al. (2010) and Section 4.1. It is worth noting that when the facility disruptions are uncorrelated (no matter homogeneous or heterogeneous), each facility is connected to exactly one station, and vice versa. This implies that the virtual station structure is no longer needed (as we can consolidate each station-facility pair into a single facility) and index k can be removed from (RFL-STA). In such cases, our station-based model (RFL-STA) will degenerate to the (LRUFL) model in Cui et al. (2010). Formulation (RFL-STA) is nonlinear because the objective and constraints (5i) contain nonlinear terms ZikjrYikjr . However, since each ZikjrYikjr is a product of a bounded continuous variable and a binary variable, we can linearize it by applying a variant of the technique introduced by Sherali and Alameddine (1992), i.e., we replace each ZikjrYikjr by a new continuous variable Wikjr and enforce their equivalence by adding the following four sets of constraints. (6a) W i k j r \u2264 Z i k j r + M \u00af k ( Y i k j r \u2212 1 ) , (6b) W i k j r \u2265 Z i k j r + M ^ k ( Y i k j r \u2212 1 ) , (6c) W i k j r \u2264 M ^ k Y i k j r , (6d) W i k j r \u2265 M \u00af k Y i k j r . The model formulation is now transformed into the following: (7a) ( LRFL-STA ) min \u2211 j \u2208 J f j X j + \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 k \u2208 K \u222a { 0 } \u2211 j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } \u2211 r = 1 R + 1 \u03bc i d i j W i k j r (7b) s.t. ( 5 b ) \u2212 ( 5 h ) , (7c) Z i k j r = ( 1 \u2212 q k ) \u2211 k \u2032 \u2208 K \u2211 j \u2032 \u2208 J q k \u2032 1 \u2212 q k \u2032 W i k \u2032 j \u2032 ( r \u2212 1 ) , \u2200 i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } , k \u2208 K \u222a { 0 } , r = 2 , 3 , \u2026 , R + 1 , (7d) ( 6 a ) \u2212 ( 6 d ) , \u2200 i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } , k \u2208 K \u222a { 0 } , r = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , R + 1 , (7e) X j , Y i k j r \u2208 { 0 , 1 } , \u2200 i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } , k \u2208 K \u222a { 0 } , r = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , R + 1 . This mixed-integer linear program (LRFL-STA) could in theory be solved by commercial solvers such as CPLEX and Gurobi. However, the existence of station-facility pairs as well as their associated site-dependent disruption quasi-probability exacerbates the model complexity. In light of this, we develop customized solution approaches in the next section. 3 Solution approach 3.1 Lagrangian relaxation We choose to relax constraints (5b) in (LRFL-STA) with Lagrangian multipliers { \u03bb i k j } \u2200 i \u2208 I , \u2200 k \u2208 K , \u2200 j \u2208 J and move them as penalty terms to the objective function. The objective function becomes min \u2211 j \u2208 J ( f j \u2212 \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 k \u2208 K \u03bb i k j ) X j + \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 k \u2208 K \u222a { 0 } \u2211 j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } \u2211 r = 1 R + 1 \u03bc i d i j W i k j r + \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 k \u2208 K \u2211 j \u2208 J \u03bb i k j \u2211 r = 1 R Y i k j r . The above relaxation of the set of constraints (5b) essentially decouples the location and assignment variables X and Y. The remaining model can be decomposed into multiple disjoint parts. The part involving X, min X j \u2208 { 0 , 1 } , \u2200 j \u2211 j \u2208 J ( f j \u2212 \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 k \u2208 K \u03bb i k j ) X j , can be solved by simple inspection; i.e., given any {\u03bbikj }, we can easily find the optimal X as follows: X j = { 1 if f j \u2212 \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 k \u2208 K \u03bb i k j < 0 ; 0 otherwise. We further notice that the remaining problem can be further separated into individual subproblems, one for each customer, as long as we relax the term \u2211 h \u2208 I \u2211 k \u2208 K \u2211 s = 1 R Y h k j 2 s in (5g) by \u2211 k \u2208 K \u2211 s = 1 R Y i k j 2 s . The relaxed subproblem (RFL-STA-SP i ) with respect to customer i is (8a) ( RFL-STA-SP i ) min \u2211 k \u2208 K \u222a { 0 } \u2211 j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } \u2211 r = 1 R + 1 \u03bc i d i j W k j r + \u2211 k \u2208 K \u2211 j \u2208 J \u03bb k j \u2211 r = 1 R Y k j r (8b) s.t. Y k j r \u2264 l k j , \u2200 j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } , k \u2208 K \u222a { 0 } , r = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , R + 1 , (8c) \u2211 j \u2208 J \u2211 r = 1 R Y k j r \u2264 1 , \u2200 k \u2208 K , (8d) \u2211 r = 1 R + 1 Y 00 r = 1 , (8e) \u2211 k \u2208 K \u2211 j \u2208 J Y k j r + \u2211 s = 1 r Y 00 s = 1 , \u2200 r = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , R + 1 , (8f) Y k 1 j 1 r \u2264 \u2211 s = 1 r \u2212 1 Y k 2 j 2 s + c i j 1 j 2 + 2 \u2212 l k 2 j 2 \u2212 \u2211 k \u2208 K \u2211 s = 1 R Y k j 2 s | I \u2225 K | R , \u2200 i \u2208 I , j 1 , j 2 \u2208 J , k 1 , k 2 \u2208 K , 2 \u2264 r \u2264 R , (8g) Z k j 1 = 1 \u2212 q k , \u2200 j \u2208 J , k \u2208 K , (8h) Z k j r = ( 1 \u2212 q k ) \u2211 k \u2032 \u2208 K \u2211 j \u2032 \u2208 J q k \u2032 1 \u2212 q k \u2032 W j \u2032 k \u2032 ( r \u2212 1 ) , \u2200 j \u2208 J , k \u2208 K , r = 2 , 3 , \u2026 , R + 1 , (8i) ( 6 a ) \u2212 ( 6 d ) , (8j) Y k j r \u2208 { 0 , 1 } , \u2200 j \u2208 J , k \u2208 K , r = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , R + 1 . Note that (RFL-STA-SP i ), although still a mixed-integer linear program, is much smaller in size than the original (LRFL-STA), and hence it can often be efficiently handled by commercial solvers like CPLEX. However, solving this subproblem repeatedly (for each customer, and across Lagrangian relaxation iterations) could pose as a computational burden. Thus, Section 3.3 further proposes an optional customized algorithm to solve (RFL-STA-SP i ). The optimal objective values from the relaxed subproblems provide a lower bound to the original problem. Section 3.2 describes a heuristic to perturb the subproblem solutions in order to obtain a feasible solution to the original problem (which provides an upper bound). With the upper bound and lower bound, we use standard subgradient techniques (Fisher, 2004) to update the multipliers \u03bb in the Lagrangian procedure; i.e., (9) \u03bb i k j n + 1 = \u03bb i k j n + t j n ( \u2211 r Y i k j r n \u2212 X j n ) , (10) t j n = \u03be n ( Z * \u2212 Z D ( \u03bb n ) ) \u2225 \u2211 r Y i k j r n \u2212 X j n \u2225 2 , where \u03bb i k j n represents a generic multiplier in the nth iteration, tn is the step size, \u03ben is a scalar, and Z* and ZD (\u03bbn ) are the best upper bound and the current lower bound, respectively. The above bounds, especially the lower bound, may be far from optimum (e.g., due to duality gaps from the relaxed constraints). If the Lagrangian relaxation algorithm fails to obtain a small enough gap in a certain number of iterations, we embed it into a branch-and-bound (B&B) framework to further reduce the gap. We construct a binary tree by branching on X. Specifically, among all unbranched variables, we select and branch on the one whose construction yields the least system cost. After building the branching tree, we run the Lagrangian relaxation algorithm at each node to determine the corresponding feasible solution and lower bound, and update them after finishing both child branches. While traversing the binary tree, depth-first search is found to perform slightly better than breadth-first or least-cost-first searches for small or moderate-sized instances (which are likely to be solved to optimality). However, if the instances are large, it is difficult to traverse the entire tree and completely close the gap. In such cases, least-cost-first search is preferable since it tends to yield a reasonably good lower bound before completely traversing the entire tree. 3.2 Upper bound To obtain a good upper bound to the original model (RFL-STA), we first fix the facility location decisions from the relaxed subproblem. Then for each customer i, we sort all station-facility pairs associated with open facilities (i.e., pair (k, j) is considered if X j = 1 , l k j = 1 ) in ascending order of (dij, pk ); (k 1, j 1) comes before (k 2, j 2) if d i j 1 < d i j 2 or d i j 1 = d i j 2 , q k 1 < q k 2 . Then at every level r, we assign customer i to pair (k, j) with the smallest (dij, qk ) as long as i has never been assigned to any pair (k, j\u2032), \u2200j\u2032 at levels 1 , 2 , \u2026 , r \u2212 1 before. The following two propositions state two properties of the optimal solution to (RFL-STA) and indicate that the feasible solution constructed from this heuristic approach is likely to be near optimum. First, constraints (5g) ensure the following property, which we state without proof: Proposition 6 (Property I) In any optimal solution (X, Y, Z) to (RFL-STA), a customer will be assigned to backup station-facility pairs based on the corresponding distances; i.e., if Y i k j r = 1 for some i, k, j, r, then X j \u2032 = 0 or l k \u2032 j \u2032 = 0 or \u2203 r \u2032 < r s.t. Y i k \u2032 j \u2032 r \u2032 = 1 , \u2200 k \u2032 , j \u2032 with d i j \u2032 < d i j . Next, the following proposition reveals the relationship between assignment decisions and station disruption quasi-probabilities: Proposition 7 (Property II) In any optimal solution (X, Y, Z) to (RFL-STA), a customer will be assigned to backup station-facility pairs that involve the same facility based on the corresponding disruption quasi-probabilities of the associated stations; i.e., if Y i k j r = 1 for some i, k, j, r, then l k \u2032 j = 0 or \u2203 j \u2032 , r \u2032 < r s.t. Y i k \u2032 j \u2032 r \u2032 = 1 , \u2200k\u2032 with q k \u2032 \u2264 q k . Proof See Appendix C.3.\u25a1 Based on these two properties, given location decisions from the relaxed subproblem solutions, if R is sufficiently large, this heuristic yields the optimal customer assignments; otherwise, it can only guarantee feasible but not necessarily optimal assignments. Nevertheless, since the quasi-probabilities for using high-level back-ups (i.e., the product of multiple station disruption quasi-probabilities, which is equivalently the product of multiple facility disruption scenario probabilities) are often smaller by orders of magnitude, the solution given by this sorting/greedy heuristic shall be quite close to the optimal one. 3.3 Lower bound As mentioned before, although the relaxed problem is separable by customer i, each subproblem is still combinatorial and the worst-case complexity is exponential. Therefore, in this section, we develop an algorithm which helps quickly find lower bounds to the relaxed subproblems (RFL-STA-SP i ). Equations (8h) show that Zkjr depends on Z k j ( r \u2212 1 ) and Y k j ( r \u2212 1 ) , which builds connections across the decision variables and brings difficulty in solving subproblem (RFL-STA-SP i ). Instead of having Zkjr directly in the formulation, we approximate them with fixed numbers. Similar properties as those stated in Propositions 6 and 7 apply to (RFL-STA-SP i ), which suggest that certain customer-station-facility assignments would never appear in the optimal solution to (RFL-STA-SP i ). We summarize them into the following rules: Rule 1 If customer i is assigned to two different facilities at some levels, then it will always be assigned to the closer facility at a lower level; i.e., Y i k 1 j 1 r 1 = Y i k 2 j 2 r 2 = 1 , and d i j 1 < d i j 2 \u21d2 r 1\u202f<\u202fr 2; Rule 2 If customer i is assigned to a facility j, then it will be assigned to all station-facility pairs associated with j, { ( k , j ) } \u2200 k : l k j = 1 at consecutive backup levels as long as k has never been used at a lower level; i.e., let K j = { k : l k j = 1 , Y i k l s = 0 , \u2200 l \u2208 J , l \u2260 j , s < r } , then Y i k j r = 1 for some k, r\u21d2 Y i k 1 j s = Y i k 2 j ( s + 1 ) = \u22ef = Y i k n j ( s + n \u2212 1 ) = 1 for some permutation k 1 , k 2 , \u2026 , k n of Kj and some s; Rule 3 If customer i is assigned to multiple station-facility pairs ( k 1 , j ) , ( k 2 , j ) , \u2026 , ( k n , j ) that involve the same facility j, then these pairs should be used in ascending order of the involved station disruption quasi-probabilities; i.e., Y i k 1 j r = Y i k 2 j ( r + 1 ) = \u22ef = Y i k n j ( r + n \u2212 1 ) = 1 \u21d2 q k 1 \u2264 q k 2 \u2264 \u22ef \u2264 q k n ; Based on these rules, we can set Y k j r = Z k j r = 0 for some (k, j, r) without affecting the optimal solution. For example, in the system shown in Fig. 1(b), if we assume that d i 1 j 1 < d i 1 j 2 , q k { 1 } < q k { 1 , 2 } < q k { 2 } < q k { 1 , 2 , 3 } < q k { 1 , 3 } < q k { 2 , 3 } , then we have: (i) Y i 1 k { 1 , 2 } j 1 1 = Y i 1 k { 1 , 2 } j 1 3 = 0 because j 1 should be used first if it is built, and k {1,2} should be used after k {1} and before k {1,3}, k {1,2,3}; (ii) Y i 1 k { 2 } j 2 1 = Y i 1 k { 2 } j 2 3 = Y i 1 k { 2 } j 2 4 = Y i 2 k { 2 } j 2 6 = 0 because k {2} should always be used after k {1,2}, and also after k {1}, k {1,2,3}, k {1,3} if j 1 is used. After setting these Ykjr and Zkjr to be zero, we can use algorithm LowerBound(i), for each customer i, to construct lower bounds to Zkjr and Z 00r as \u03b1kjr and \u03b2r , respectively, and relax (RFL-STA-SP i ) into the following (RFL-STA-RSP i ): We replace Zkjr and Z 00r respectively by their estimates \u03b1kjr and \u03b2r , and relax (RFL-STA-SP i ) into the following (RFL-STA-RSP i ): (11a) ( RFL-STA-RSP i ) min \u2211 k \u2208 K \u2211 j \u2208 J \u2211 r = 1 R + 1 ( \u03bc i d i j \u03b1 k j r + \u03bb k j r ) Y k j r + \u2211 r = 1 R + 1 \u03bc i d i 0 \u03b2 r Y 00 r (11b) s.t. Y k j r \u2264 l k j , \u2200 j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } , k \u2208 K \u222a { 0 } , r = 1 , 2 , \u22ef , R + 1 , (11c) \u2211 j \u2208 J \u2211 r = 1 R Y k j r \u2264 1 , \u2200 k \u2208 K , (11d) \u2211 r = 1 R + 1 Y 00 r = 1 , (11e) \u2211 k \u2208 K \u2211 j \u2208 J Y k j r + \u2211 s = 1 r Y 00 s = 1 , \u2200 r = 1 , 2 , \u22ef , R + 1 , (11f) Y k j r \u2208 { 0 , 1 } , \u2200 j \u2208 J , k \u2208 K , r = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , R + 1 . Proposition 8 The solution to (RFL-STA-RSP i ) is a lower bound to the solution to ( RFL-STA-SP i ). Proof Let Y*, Z* and W* be the optimal solution to (RFL-STA-SP i ). We can construct (RFL-STA-RSP i ) from (RFL-STA-SP i ) in three sequential steps: (i) replace Zkjr and Z 00r by \u03b1kjr and \u03b2r , respectively, and add constraints to set Y k j r = 0 for some (k, j, r) pairs; (ii) remove constraints (8f)\u2013(8i); and (iii) remove those constraints Y k j r = 0 that were added in step (i), and instead, set the corresponding \u03b1kjr to be sufficiently large. In step (i), we know that adding those Y i k j = 0 does not change the optimal solution to (RFL-STA-SP i ), and based on the construction of \u03b1kjr and \u03b2r , we know \u03b1 k j r Y k j r * and \u03b2 r Y 00 r * are lower bounds to Z k j r * and Z 00 r * , respectively. In step (ii), removing constraints obviously never increases the objective value of a minimization problem. Step (iii) just uses an alternative way to enforce the Y k j r = 0 constraints; i.e., when the coefficients of those Ykjr are set to be infinity, these variables cannot equal 1 at optimality (because a finite feasible solution is known to exist). Therefore, each of the three steps provides a lower bound to the model built in the previous step, hence the optimal objective value of (RFL-STA-RSP i ) is a lower bound to the optimal objective value of ( RFL-STA-SP i ). This completes the proof.\u25a1 We observe that ( RFL-STA-RSP i ) is a combinatorial generalized assignment problem, which can be solved by an adapted Hungarian algorithm as in Cui et al. (2010). ( RFL-STA-RSP i ) aims at assigning one station-facility pair to each level (up to R + 1 ) based on the updated coefficients associated with each Ykjr , so as to minimize the total expected system cost. However, the actual maximum assignment level R max (i.e., the largest r such that Y k j r = 1 for some (k, j) pair) may be smaller than R due to lower cost associated with the emergency station-facility pair than all other remaining pairs at some level r\u202f<\u202fR. The main challenge is to identify the level that the emergency station-facility pair should be assigned to. As such, we enumerate R max from 0 to R and for each R max, we fix Y 00 , R max + 1 = 1 and Y k j r = 0 , r > R max + 1 . In this way, the ( RFL-STA-RSP i ) is simplified into a standard assignment problem that can be solved by conventional Hungarian algorithm. We solve ( RFL-STA-RSP i ) and calculate the associated total cost for each enumeration of R max. By comparison, the value of R max corresponding to the lowest total cost is the actual maximum assignment level R max. After fixing R max, It is worth noting that in the enumeration process, the assignment solutions to model with R max = r can be used as a warm start to the model with R max = r + 1 , which helps expedite the computation. Specifically, if the penalty cost d i0 (or say \u03c0i ) is sufficiently large, we only need to solve ( RFL-STA-RSP i ) for one iteration, i.e., R max = R . 4 Case study We apply the proposed model and solution algorithms to two sets of examples under different correlation patterns and parameter settings. The first set of examples demonstrate reliable facility system planning for the U.S. networks with 49 and 88 nodes under given correlation patterns; see Fig. 3 . 3 3 The location data set is from Snyder and Daskin (2005) and can be accessed at http://www.lehigh.edu/~lvs2, all input data, including the correlation profile, will be available for download at the corresponding author\u2019s webpage https://yfouyang.cee.illinois.edu. The second set of examples are used to compare the results and computational performance of the scenario-based and station-based formulations. In all cases, the customer set I and facility candidate set J are set to be the same. The proposed solution algorithms are programmed in C++ and run on a 64-bit Intel i7-3770 computer with 3.40\u202fGHz CPU and 8\u202fG RAM. The reformulated problem ( RFL-STA-RSP i ) is solved by the Hungarian algorithm. 4.1 U.S. network cases We first test our methodology on the U.S. map: (i) a 49-node network with locations as the state capitals of the continental United States plus Washington, D.C.; and (ii) a 88-node network with the 49-node locations and 39 other largest cities in the United States. Local disruption correlations are observed among the locations in each of the 8 local areas in the 49-node network (see different markers in Fig. 3(a)). Facility disruptions across these local areas, however, are assumed to be independent. The scenario-based correlation profile (as if obtained from historical observations) for each local area is presented in Table 1 , in which the column with header \u201cJ\u201d lists the facility locations disrupted in each scenario, and the column with header \u201c p J S \u201d presents the corresponding scenario probabilities. The resulting station structure, including the set of facilities Jk connected to each station k as well as its disruption quasi-probability qk , is listed in Table 2 . The total number of stations is 75, which is much smaller than the total number of scenarios in the entire network 12 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 2 14 = 4.41 \u00d7 10 11 . Similarly, the 88-node network as shown in Fig. 3(b) includes 13 local areas. The scenario-based disruption correlation profile for each local area is presented in Table 3 , and the resulting station structure is listed in Table 4 . Again, the total number of stations is only 129, while the total number of scenarios is 4.4\u202f\u00d7\u202f1018. We first test our model and algorithm for R = 10 , 15 , 20 , 75 using the 49-node network with the system parameter values from Snyder and Daskin (2005), and R = 10 , 20 , 30 , 129 using the 88-node network. For the 49-node network, in particular, we run three set of instances (49-I, 49-II, 49-III): (1) 49-I uses the exactly same parameter values as Snyder and Daskin (2005); (2) 49-II reduces the fixed facility costs to 1/3 of their original values in Snyder and Daskin (2005); and (3) 49-III doubles all the input scenario probabilities in Tables 1 and 3. In addition, We run another instance with independent facility disruptions using each of the network, with the same marginal facility probabilities as the correlated instances. The initial values of the Lagrangian multipliers are all set to be 0, and the Lagrangian relaxation/B&B procedure is executed to a tolerance of 0.5%, or up to 3600 seconds in CPU time. The algorithm performance is summarized in Table 5 , and the optimal facility locations and initial customer assignments are shown in Fig. 4 . From Table 5 and Fig. 4, we can summarize the following observations:: (1) our model and algorithm perform very well, especially on the 49-node cases, solving the first set (i.e., case 49 -I) to less than 1% gap and most of the other two sets (i.e., 49-II, 49-III) to less than 5% gap within 1 h. For the larger 88-node cases, we can still obtain 7%-8% gap within 1 h computation time; (2) the maximum back-up level R does affect the location decision and optimal system cost when R is small; however, when R becomes large, the optimal facility locations are insensitive to it. This implies that we can set an arbitrary yet reasonably large value of R for many applications; (3) even with a sufficiently large R, i.e., R = | K | , such that the station-based formulation is exactly equivalent to the scenario-based formulation, our algorithm still works quite effectively, as it is capable of providing solutions with a small optimality gap within a short amount of time; (4) by comparing the second set of 49-node cases (i.e., 49-II) under independent and correlated facility disruptions, we can see that ignoring correlations in reliable facility location models may lead to quite sub-optimal system design, i.e., solutions provided in the independent and correlated instances are different; (5) finally, the comparison between 49-I and 49-III, as expected, implies that doubling input disruption probabilities increases the overall system cost as well as the optimal number of facilities to be built. 4.2 Model comparison To better demonstrate the advantage of the proposed modeling framework, we further test both the scenario-based formulation (RFL-SCE) and station-based formulation (RFL-STA) on four networks, with 14, 17, 19, and 25 nodes, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5 , each of the four networks is part of the 49-node network in Fig. 3, with the corresponding local correlation profiles presented in Table 1. For example, the three local areas in Fig. 5(a) correspond to Local 2, Local 3, and Local 4 in Table 1, respectively, with the location indices adjusted accordingly. Independent stations (those not appearing in Table 1) each fail independently with probability 0.02. Table 6 compares the results from (RFL-SCE) and (RFL-STA). It can be observed that for each case, the solutions (i.e., the final UB and location decisions) from the two formulations are exactly the same. However, our station-based formulation can be solved to optimality much more quickly than the scenario-based formulation, especially when correlations are present. In particular, the scenario-based formulation cannot even provide a feasible solution to the 25-node network due to exhaustion of computer memory (by the excessive number of scenarios). This comparison verifies the correctness and effectiveness of our station-based formulation (RFL-STA), as well as its clear superiority over the traditional scenario-based formulation (RFL-SCE), even for moderate-sized problem instances. We can easily project that the advantage will be even bigger for larger applications. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we focus on the problem of reliable facility location design under correlated facility disruptions. To handle the complexity associated with correlated facility disruptions, we incorporate and extent the idea of supporting station structure introduced in Li et al. (2013); Xie et al. (2015), and augment the original facility system by adding an additional layer of supporting stations. The stations, each being associated with a site-dependent disruption quasi-probability (which may take a value larger than 1), are assumed to function independently and can equivalently capture the effect of correlation among facility disruptions. We show a number of important properties of such a station structure. To optimize facility location design, we further show that the reliable facility location problem under correlated facility disruptions can be formulated into a compact mixed-integer mathematical model, which is equivalent to the traditional scenario-based formulation and is much more compact in size. The proposed model can be solved by customized Lagrangian relaxation algorithms (with customized modules for obtaining upper and lower bounds). Multiple case studies with various network settings and correlation patterns are conducted to test the performance and applicability of the methodology. Superiority of the proposed station structure has also been clearly demonstrated via numerical experiments. The study can be further extended in several directions. First, in many real-world contexts, the reachability of facilities or the access distances could be affected by the facility/station disruptions as well. For example, debris from earthquakes or floods may block nearby roadway segments and change the shortest paths between points. Such complicating issues should be addressed in future studies. Second, real-world applications may involve specific types of correlation patterns from physical laws (e.g., decaying probability of failure \u201ccontagion\u201d, or conventional correlation matrix). Specific model structure and insights might be available at those correlation patterns. Third, it will be beneficial to conduct a systematic complexity analysis on data input preparation, model formulation, and solution algorithm for the most general correlation patterns. We also plan to apply our methodology to more real-world cases, so as to help policy makers develop engineering and planning guidelines that will lead to more reliable and resilient systems. In light of the large size of many real-world applications, additional efforts might be put on developing even more sophisticated and effective solution algorithms. Contribution statement Reliable facility location models have been developed in a variety of forms to address probabilistic facility disruptions. Most of these existing models assume independent facility disruptions. In reality, however, disruptions could be correlated when the facilities are subject to shared hazards/mutual interactions, and such correlations could be positive or negative, or mixed. Facing the challenge of handling an exponential number of disruption scenarios even for a given location design, only a few very recent studies have incorporated correlated facility disruptions into the location design framework for very special correlation patterns. A systematic methodology framework is needed to design reliable facility locations under site-dependent and generally correlated facility disruptions. In this paper, we extend the station structure approach in Li et al. (2013) and incorporate the idea of quasi-probability (Xie et al., 2015) to capture any pattern of facility disruption correlations (positive, negative, or mixed). An additional layer of supporting stations are added and properly connected to the facilities. These stations, each being associated with a site-dependent disruption quasi-probability, are assumed to function independently and can equivalently capture the correlations among facilities. With these newly added stations, we are able to develop a compact mixed-integer mathematical model to optimize the reliable facility location decisions. To hedge against the complexity associated with the model, Lagrangian relaxation based algorithms, including customized modules for obtaining upper bound and lower bounds of relaxed subproblems are developed. Multiple case studies with various types of correlated facility disruptions are carried out to demonstrate the applicability and performance of our model and algorithms. Managerial insights are also drawn.

(2015) for building the station structure from the scenario representation of facility disruption correlations, i.e., S = { p J S } \u2200 J \u2286 J . Formula (4), which calculates station disruption quasi-probabilities from scenario probabilities, can be decomposed via two steps: (i) calculate marginal facility disruption probability p J M as follows (B.1) p J M = \u2211 J 1 : J \u2286 J 1 p J 1 S ; and (ii) calculate station disruption quasi-probabilties as follows (B.2) q k J = \u220f L : J \u00af \u2286 L \u2286 J [ p L M ] ( \u2212 1 ) | L | \u2212 | J \u00af | + 1 . To illustrate the idea, we use the simple three-facility system in Fig. 1(a)\u2013(b) as an example. The scenario-based disruption probabilities are given as input data, as shown in Table B.1 . The marginal facility disruption probabilities from (B.1) is as follows: p { 1 } M = p { 1 } S + p { 1 , 2 } S + p { 1 , 3 } S + p { 1 , 2 , 3 } S = 0.60 , p { 2 } M = p { 2 } S + p { 1 , 2 } S + p { 2 , 3 } S + p { 1 , 2 , 3 } S = 0.55 , p { 3 } M = p { 3 } S + p { 1 , 3 } S + p { 2 , 3 } S + p { 1 , 2 , 3 } S = 0.50 , p { 1 , 2 } M = p { 1 , 2 } S + p { 1 , 2 , 3 } S = 0.45 , p { 1 , 3 } M = p { 1 , 3 } S + p { 1 , 2 , 3 } S = 0.40 , p { 2 , 3 } M = p { 2 , 3 } S + p { 1 , 2 , 3 } S = 0.35 , p { 1 , 2 , 3 } M = p { 1 , 2 , 3 } S = 0.30 . Then from (B.2), the disruption quasi-probabilities for the stations can be computed as q k { 1 } = p { 1 , 2 , 3 } M p { 2 , 3 } M = 0.30 0.35 = 0.86 , q k { 2 } = p { 1 , 2 , 3 } M p { 1 , 3 } M = 0.30 0.40 = 0.75 , q k { 3 } = p { 1 , 2 , 3 } M p { 1 , 2 } M = 0.30 0.45 = 0.67 , q k { 1 , 2 } = p { 1 , 3 } M \u00b7 p { 2 , 3 } M p { 3 } M \u00b7 p { 1 , 2 , 3 } M = 0.40 \u00b7 0.35 0.50 \u00b7 0.30 = 0.93 , q k { 1 , 3 } = p { 1 , 2 } M \u00b7 p { 2 , 3 } M p { 2 } M \u00b7 p { 1 , 2 , 3 } M = 0.45 \u00b7 0.35 0.55 \u00b7 0.30 = 0.95 , q k { 2 , 3 } = p { 1 , 2 } M \u00b7 p { 1 , 3 } M p { 1 } M \u00b7 p { 1 , 2 , 3 } M = 0.45 \u00b7 0.40 0.60 \u00b7 0.30 = 1.00 , q k { 1 , 2 , 3 } = p { 1 } M \u00b7 p { 2 } M \u00b7 p { 3 } M \u00b7 p { 1 , 2 , 3 } M p { 1 , 2 } M \u00b7 p { 1 , 3 } M \u00b7 p { 2 , 3 } M = 0.60 \u00b7 0.55 \u00b7 0.50 \u00b7 0.30 0.45 \u00b7 0.40 \u00b7 0.35 = 0.79 . In so doing, the entire marginal representation and associated station structure are obtained, as summarized in Table B.1. Appendix C Proof of propositions C1 Proof of Proposition 5 Proof We first map an optimal solution to (RFL-STA) to a feasible solution to (RFL-SCE). Let (X, Y, Z) be an optimal solution to (RFL-STA). We let j ( i , r ) = j : Y i k j r = 1 , k ( i , r ) = k : Y i k j r = 1 , J ( i , r ) = { j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } : j \u2260 j ( i , r ) , \u2203 k , l \u2264 r \u2212 1 , Y i k j l = 1 } , R i = { 1 } \u222a { r > 1 : \u2203 j \u2260 j \u2032 , k \u2260 k \u2032 , s.t. Y i k j r = Y i k \u2032 j \u2032 r \u2212 1 = 1 } , and for each r \u2208 R , we let r i ( r ) \u2208 { r \u2032 : r \u2032 \u2208 R i , r \u2032 > r , r \u2032 \u2264 r \u2033 , \u2200 r \u2033 > r } . We construct a solution (X\u2032, Y\u2032) as follows (i) X j \u2032 = X j ; (ii) Y i j \u03c9 \u2032 = { 1 , if j = j ( i , r ) for some r , \u03b4 j \u03c9 = 1 , \u03b4 j \u2032 \u03c9 = 0 , \u2200 j \u2032 \u2208 J ( i , r ) ; 0 , otherwise. By construction, (X\u2032, Y\u2032) is a feasible solution to (RFL-SCE). In particular, for any customer i \u2208 I and any scenario \u03c9\u202f\u2208\u202f\u03a9, either there exists exactly one j \u2208 J such that j = j ( i , r ) for some r , \u03b4 j \u03c9 = 1 , \u03b4 j \u2032 \u03c9 = 0 , \u2200 j \u2032 \u2208 J ( i , r ) , or there exists no j \u2208 J such that j = j ( i , r ) for some r , \u03b4 j \u03c9 = 1 . Hence, there exists exactly one j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } such that Y i j \u03c9 = 1 , \u2200 i \u2208 I , \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 , which implies that (1b) hold. We next show that (X\u2032, Y\u2032) achieves the same objective value as (X, Y, Z). We denote \u03a6(X, Y, Z) and \u03a8(X\u2032, Y\u2032) as the objectives of (RFL-STA) and (RFL-SCE), respectively, and \u03a9 ( i , r ) = { \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : Y i j ( i , r ) \u03c9 \u2032 = 1 } . We have the following result \u03a8 ( X \u2032 , Y \u2032 ) = \u2211 j \u2208 J f j X j \u2032 + \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } \u2211 \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 \u03bc i d i j Y i j \u03c9 \u2032 p \u03c9 = \u2211 j \u2208 J f j X j + \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 r \u2208 R i \u03bc i d i j ( i , r ) \u2211 \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 ( i , r ) p \u03c9 = \u2211 j \u2208 J f j X j + \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 r \u2208 R i \u03bc i d i j ( i , r ) \u2211 J : J ( i , r ) \u2286 J , j ( i , r ) \u2209 J p J S .

Conversely, we map an optimal solution to (RFL-SCE) to a feasible solution to (RFL-STA). Given an optimal solution (X, Y) to (RFL-SCE), without loss of generality, we assume that each customer always visits its closest open facility for service, and if there exist more than one facility with equal distance, we break the tie by choosing the facility based on index: let J * = { j \u2208 J : X j = 1 } , for each customer i, let j 1 i , j 2 i , \u2026 , j | J * | + 1 i be an ordering of the facilities in J* \u222a {0} such that for all 2 \u2264 r \u2264 | J * | + 1 , d i j r \u2212 1 i \u2264 d i j r i and if d i j r \u2212 1 i = d i j r i , j r \u2212 1 i < j r i . Since a facility is functioning if and only if at least one of its connected stations is operating, we let K * = { k \u2208 K : \u2203 j \u2208 J * , l j k = 1 } , and r n i = | { k \u2208 K * : \u2203 n 1 < n , l j n 1 i = 1 } | be the total number of stations that are connected to at least one facility in { j 1 i , \u2026 , j n \u2212 1 i } , we know that facility j n i is visited by i if only if all facilities in { j 1 i , \u2026 , j n \u2212 1 i } are unavailable (i.e, all the r n i stations are disrupted). Then we define two sequences of facilities and stations respectively as: (i) j ( i , 1 ) , j ( i , 2 ) , \u2026 , j ( i , | K * | + 1 ) such that j ( i , r ) \u2208 { j : r j < r \u2264 r j + 1 } ; and (ii) k ( i , 1 ) , k ( i , 2 ) , \u2026 , k ( i , | K * | + 1 ) such that k ( i , r ) \u2208 K ( i , r ) = { k : l j ( i , r ) k = 1 , l j ( i , l ) k = 0 , \u2200 l < r , j ( i , l ) \u2260 j ( i , r ) } , and if K ( i , r \u2212 1 ) = K ( i , r ) , k ( i , r \u2212 1 ) < k ( i , r ) . We construct a solution (X\u2032, Y\u2032, Z\u2032) as follows (i) X j \u2032 = X j ; (ii) Y i k j r \u2032 = { 1 , if j = j ( i , r ) , k = k ( i , r ) , d i j \u2264 d i 0 ; 0 , otherwise; (iii) Z i k j r \u2032 = { ( 1 \u2212 q k ( i , r ) ) \u220f l = 1 r \u2212 1 q k ( i , l ) , if j = j ( i , r ) , k = k ( i , r ) , d i j \u2264 d i 0 ; 0 , otherwise. By examining the constraint sets in (RFL-STA), we observe that (X\u2032, Y\u2032, Z\u2032) is a feasible solution to (RFL-STA). We next show that (X\u2032, Y\u2032, Z\u2032) achieves the same objective value as (X, Y). We let R i = { r 1 i + 1 , r 2 i + 1 , \u2026 , r | J * | + 1 i + 1 } , for each r \u2208 R i , we let r i ( r ) \u2208 { r \u2032 : r \u2032 \u2208 R i , r \u2032 > r , r \u2032 \u2264 r \u2033 , \u2200 r \u2033 > r } , and \u03a9 ( i , r ) = { \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 : \u03b4 j ( i , r ) \u03c9 = 1 , \u03b4 j ( i , l ) \u03c9 = 0 , \u2200 l < r , j ( i , l ) \u2260 j ( i , r ) } \u03a6 ( X \u2032 , Y \u2032 , Z \u2032 ) = \u2211 j \u2208 J f j X j \u2032 + \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } \u2211 k \u2208 K \u222a { 0 } \u2211 r = 1 R + 1 \u03bc i d i j Y i k j r \u2032 Z i k j r \u2032 = \u2211 j \u2208 J f j X j + \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 r = 1 R + 1 \u03bc i d i j ( i , r ) \u220f l = 1 r \u2212 1 q k ( i , l ) ( 1 \u2212 q k ( i , r ) ) = \u2211 j \u2208 J f j X j + \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 r \u2208 R i \u03bc i d i j ( i , r ) \u2211 l = r r i ( r ) \u2212 1 \u220f l \u2032 = 1 l \u2212 1 q k ( i , l \u2032 ) ( 1 \u2212 q k ( i , l ) ) = \u2211 j \u2208 J f j X j + \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 r \u2208 R i \u03bc i d i j ( i , r ) \u2211 J : J ( i , r ) \u2286 J , j ( i , r ) \u2209 J p J S = \u2211 j \u2208 J f j X j + \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 r \u2208 R i \u03bc i d i j ( i , r ) \u2211 \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 ( i , r ) p \u03c9 = \u2211 j \u2208 J f j X j + \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 j \u2208 J \u222a { 0 } \u2211 \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 \u03bc i d i j Y i j \u03c9 p \u03c9 = \u03a8 ( X , Y ) . Therefore, the optimal solution to (RFL-STA) is also a lower bound to (RFL-SCE), implying that the optimal solutions to (RFL-STA) and (RFL-SCE) are exactly the same. This completes our proof.\u25a1 C2 Example for the proof of Proposition 5 Proof We present a small example to better illustrate the proof procedure in C.1. Considering the three-facility system presented in Appendix B, we first assume that the optimal solution to (RFL-STA) is (X, Y, Z) with X 1 = X 3 = 1 , X 2 = 0 , Y 1 k { 1 } 11 = Y 1 k { 1 , 2 } 12 = Y 1 k { 1 , 3 } 13 = Y 1 k { 1 , 2 , 3 } 14 = Y 1 k { 3 } 35 = Y 1 k { 2 , 3 } 36 = Y 1007 = 1 , Y 2 k { 1 } 11 = Y 2 k { 1 , 2 } 12 = Y 2 k { 1 , 3 } 13 = Y 2 k { 1 , 2 , 3 } 14 = Y 2 k { 3 } 35 = Y 2 k { 2 , 3 } 36 = Y 2007 = 1 , Y 3 k { 3 } 31 = Y 3 k { 1 , 3 } 32 = Y 3 k { 2 , 3 } 33 = Y 3 k { 1 , 2 , 3 } 34 = Y 3 k { 1 } 15 = Y 3 k { 1 , 2 } 16 = Y 3007 = 1 , and the optimal objective is \u03a6 ( X , Y , Z ) = f 1 + f 3 + \u03bc 1 ( d 13 q k { 1 } q k { 1 , 2 } q k { 1 , 3 } q k { 1 , 2 , 3 } ( 1 \u2212 q k { 3 } q k { 2 , 3 } ) + \u03c0 1 q k { 1 } q k { 1 , 2 } q k { 1 , 3 } q k { 1 , 2 , 3 } q k { 3 } q k { 2 , 3 } ) + \u03bc 3 ( d 31 q k { 3 } q k { 1 , 3 } q k { 2 , 3 } q k { 1 , 2 , 3 } ( 1 \u2212 q k { 1 } q k { 1 , 2 } ) + \u03c0 3 q k { 3 } q k { 1 , 3 } q k { 2 , 3 } q k { 1 , 2 , 3 } q k { 1 } q k { 1 , 2 } ) + \u03bc 2 ( d 21 ( 1 \u2212 q k { 1 } q k { 1 , 2 } q k { 1 , 3 } q k { 1 , 2 , 3 } ) + d 23 q k { 1 } q k { 1 , 2 } q k { 1 , 3 } q k { 1 , 2 , 3 } ( 1 \u2212 q k { 3 } q k { 2 , 3 } ) + \u03c0 2 q k { 1 } q k { 1 , 2 } q k { 1 , 3 } q k { 1 , 2 , 3 } q k { 3 } q k { 2 , 3 } ) = f 1 + f 3 + \u03bc 1 ( 0.2 d 13 + 0.4 \u03c0 1 ) + \u03bc 2 ( 0.4 d 21 + 0.2 d 23 + 0.4 \u03c0 2 ) + \u03bc 3 ( 0.1 d 31 + 0.4 \u03c0 3 ) Constructing from (X, Y, Z), a feasible solution to (RFL-SCE) is (X\u2032, Y\u2032, Z\u2032) with X 1 \u2032 = X 3 \u2032 = 1 , X 2 \u2032 = 0 , Y 11 \u2205 \u2032 = Y 11 { 2 } \u2032 = Y 11 { 3 } \u2032 = Y 11 { 2 , 3 } \u2032 = Y 13 { 1 } \u2032 = Y 13 { 1 , 2 } \u2032 = Y 10 { 1 , 3 } \u2032 = Y 10 { 1 , 2 , 3 } \u2032 = 1 , Y 21 \u2205 \u2032 = Y 21 { 2 } \u2032 = Y 21 { 3 } \u2032 = Y 21 { 2 , 3 } \u2032 = Y 23 { 1 } \u2032 = Y 23 { 1 , 2 } \u2032 = Y 20 { 1 , 3 } \u2032 = Y 20 { 1 , 2 , 3 } \u2032 = 1 , Y 33 \u2205 \u2032 = Y 33 { 1 } \u2032 = Y 33 { 2 } \u2032 = Y 33 { 1 , 2 } \u2032 = Y 31 { 3 } \u2032 = Y 31 { 2 , 3 } \u2032 = Y 30 { 1 , 3 } \u2032 = Y 30 { 1 , 2 , 3 } \u2032 = 1 , which gives the corresponding objective value as \u03a8 ( X \u2032 , Y \u2032 , Z \u2032 ) = f 1 + f 3 + \u03bc 1 ( d 13 ( p { 1 } + p { 1 , 2 } ) + \u03c0 1 ( p { 1 , 3 } + p { 1 , 2 , 3 } ) ) + \u03bc 3 ( d 31 ( p { 3 } + p { 2 , 3 } ) + \u03c0 3 ( p { 1 , 3 } + p { 1 , 2 , 3 } ) ) + \u03bc 2 ( d 21 ( p \u2205 + p { 2 } + p { 3 } + p { 2 , 3 } ) + d 23 ( p { 1 } + p { 1 , 2 } ) + \u03c0 2 ( p { 1 , 3 } + p { 1 , 2 , 3 } ) ) = f 1 + f 3 + \u03bc 1 ( 0.2 d 13 + 0.4 \u03c0 1 ) + \u03bc 2 ( 0.4 d 21 + 0.2 d 23 + 0.4 \u03c0 2 ) + \u03bc 3 ( 0.1 d 31 + 0.4 \u03c0 3 ) = \u03a6 ( X , Y , Z ) . This implies that the optimal solution to (RFL-SCE) is no larger than \u03a6(X, Y, Z), thus is a lower bound to (RFL-STA). Conversely, assuming that the optimal solution to (RFL-SCE) is (X\u2032, Y\u2032, Z\u2032), we can construct (X, Y, Z) which is a feasible solution to (RFL-STA) (The detail is omitted here as it is very similar to the procedure described right above). Since \u03a6 ( X , Y , Z ) = \u03a8 ( X \u2032 , Y \u2032 , Z \u2032 ) , the optimal solution to (RFL-STA) is no larger than \u03a8(X\u2032, Y\u2032, Z\u2032), thus is a lower bound to (RFL-SCE). Therefore, we can conclude that the optimal solutions to (RFL-SCE) and (RFL-STA) are exactly the same.\u25a1 C3 Proof of Proposition 7 Proof Suppose, for a contradiction, that (X, Y, Z) is optimal to (RFL-STA) but violates Property II, i.e., there exist i, j, k 1, k 2, r such that X j = 1 , l k 1 j = l k 2 j = 1 , q k 1 \u2264 q k 2 , Y i k 2 j r = 1 , Y i k 1 j r \u2032 = 0 , \u2200 r \u2032 < r . We will show that by replacing k 2 with k 1 the objective of (RFL-STA) will decrease. We simply construct a different solution (X\u2032, Y\u2032, Z\u2032) as follows: (i) X j \u2032 = X j ; (ii) Y h k l s \u2032 = { 1 , if ( h , k , l , s ) = ( i , k 1 , j , r ) ; 0 , if ( h , k , l , s ) = ( i , k 2 , j , r ) ; Y h k l s , otherwise; (iii) Z h k l s \u2032 = { 1 \u2212 q k 1 1 \u2212 q k 2 Z h k 2 l s , if ( h , k , l , s ) = ( i , k 1 , j , r ) ; 0 , if ( h , k , l , s ) = ( i , k 2 , j , r ) ; q k 1 q k 2 Z h k l s , if s > r ; Z h k l s , otherwise. By construction, (X\u2032, Y\u2032, Z\u2032) is a feasible solution to (RFL-STA). We use \u03a6(X, Y, Z) to denote the objective value of (RFL-STA) associated with (X, Y, Z), assume that Y i k i r j i r r = Y i 00 R i = 1 , it follows that \u03a6 ( X , Y , Z ) \u2212 \u03a6 ( X \u2032 , Y \u2032 , Z \u2032 ) = \u03bc i d i j Z k 2 j r + \u2211 s = r + 1 R i \u03bc i d i l i s Z k i s l i s s \u2212 ( \u03bc i d i j Z k 1 j r \u2032 + \u2211 s = r + 1 R i \u03bc i d i l i s Z k i s l i s s \u2032 ) = \u03bc i Z k 2 j r 1 \u2212 q k 2 [ d i j ( 1 \u2212 q k 2 ) + q k 2 \u2211 s = r + 1 R i d i l i s \u220f s \u2032 = r + 1 s \u2212 1 q k i s \u2032 ( 1 \u2212 q k i s ) \u2212 ( d i j ( 1 \u2212 q k 1 ) + q k 1 \u2211 s = r + 1 R i d i l i s \u220f s \u2032 = r + 1 s \u2212 1 q k i s \u2032 ( 1 \u2212 q k i s ) ) ] = \u03bc i Z k 2 j r 1 \u2212 q k 2 ( q k 2 \u2212 q k 1 ) ( \u2212 d i j + \u2211 s = r + 1 R i d i l i s \u220f s \u2032 = r + 1 s \u2212 1 q k i s \u2032 ( 1 \u2212 q k i s ) ) As q k i R i = 0 , and d i l i s \u2264 d i l i , s + 1 from Proposition 6, we have \u2211 s = R i \u2212 1 R i d i l i s \u220f s \u2032 = r + 1 s \u2212 1 q k i s \u2032 ( 1 \u2212 q k i s ) \u2265 d i l i R i \u2212 1 \u220f s \u2032 = r + 1 R i \u2212 2 q k i s \u2032 ( 1 \u2212 q k i R i \u2212 1 ) + d i l i R i \u2212 1 \u220f s \u2032 = r + 1 R i \u2212 1 q k i s \u2032 = d i l i R i \u2212 1 \u220f s \u2032 = r + 1 R i \u2212 2 q k i s \u2032 By induction, we can conclude that \u2212 d i j + \u2211 s = r + 1 R i d i l i s \u220f s \u2032 = r + 1 s \u2212 1 q k i s \u2032 ( 1 \u2212 q k i s ) \u2265 \u2212 d i j + d i l i r + 1 \u2265 0 . Since \u03bc i Z k 2 j r 1 \u2212 q k 2 \u2265 0 , q k 2 \u2212 q k 1 \u2265 0 , we have \u03a6(X, Y, Z)\u202f\u2265\u202f\u03a6(X\u2032, Y\u2032, Z\u2032), which implies that \u03a6(X, Y, Z) is not optimal.
