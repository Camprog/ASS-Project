"Ecological ModellingOptimal management of non-Markovian biological populationsAbstract Wildlife populations typically are described by Markovian models, with population dynamics influenced at each point in time by current but not previous population levels. Considerable work has been done on identifying optimal management strategies under the Markovian assumption. In this paper we generalize this work to non-Markovian systems, for which population responses to management are influenced by lagged as well as current status and/or controls. We use the maximum principle of optimal control theory to derive conditions for the optimal management such a system, and illustrate the effects of lags on the structure of optimal habitat strategies for a predator\u2013prey system.serial JL 271743 291210 291728 291780 291840 31 Ecological Modelling ECOLOGICALMODELLING 2006-09-08 2006-09-08 2010-10-08T02:45:02 1-s2.0-S0304380006003668 S0304-3800(06)00366-8 S0304380006003668 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.07.039 S300 S300.1 FULL-TEXT 1-s2.0-S0304380006X04295 2015-05-14T06:43:49.314216-04:00 0 0 20070110 2007 2006-09-08T00:00:00Z articleinfo crossmark dco dateupdated tomb dateloaded datesearch indexeddate issuelist volumelist yearnav articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright dateloadedtxt docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid issfirst issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sectiontitle sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype subheadings volfirst volissue webpdf webpdfpagecount body mmlmath acknowledge affil appendices articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authkeywords authlast primabst ref alllist content subj ssids 0304-3800 03043800 200 200 1 2 1 2 Volume 200, Issues 1\u20132 24 234 242 234 242 20070110 10 January 2007 2007-01-10 2007 Research papers article fla Published by Elsevier B.V.

Williams \u204e byron_ken_williams@usgs.gov Cooperative Research Units, U.S. Geological Survey, 12202 Sunrise Valley Drive, Reston, VA 22092, USA \u204e Tel.: +1 703 648 4260; fax: +1 703 648 4269. Abstract Wildlife populations typically are described by Markovian models, with population dynamics influenced at each point in time by current but not previous population levels. Considerable work has been done on identifying optimal management strategies under the Markovian assumption. In this paper we generalize this work to non-Markovian systems, for which population responses to management are influenced by lagged as well as current status and/or controls. We use the maximum principle of optimal control theory to derive conditions for the optimal management such a system, and illustrate the effects of lags on the structure of optimal habitat strategies for a predator\u2013prey system. Keywords Maximum principle Non-Markovian Optimal control Population dynamics Predator\u2013prey Substantial progress has been made in recent decades in the general area of informed natural resource management. Approaches to optimal decision making have been described and adopted in the management of various natural resources (reviewed by Williams, 1982, 1989; Williams et al., 2002). Such approaches include the ability to deal with sequential decisions for dynamical systems and even to incorporate in the optimization the reduction of uncertainty over time (e.g., Walters, 1986; Williams, 1996a,b; Williams and Nichols, 2001; Williams et al., 2002). Perhaps the most prominent use of these approaches in real world management involves the adaptive harvest management program for North American duck populations implemented in 1995 (Johnson et al., 1993, 1997; Nichols et al., 1995; Williams and Johnson, 1995; Williams et al., 1996). Virtually all of the development for optimal decision processes in natural resources to date has involved the management of systems that can be characterized as first order Markov processes. For such processes, changes in system state between two times, t and t +1, depend only on system state at time t. However, for many biological systems it is difficult or impossible to adequately represent system dynamics without incorporating time lags. Hutchinson (1948) first considered the incorporation of a time lag in the Verhulst\u2013Pearl logistic equation, such that the rate of change in population size at time t, dN/dt, is determined by population size at some previous time, N (t\u2212\u03c4), where \u03c4 denotes the time lag. He noted that introduction of a lag induces oscillations, with system stability determined by the magnitude of the lag (Hutchinson, 1948). Leslie (1959) considered discrete time models in which age-specific survival and reproductive rates depended not only on abundance at the current time, but also on abundance at previous times. Leslie (1959) focused on the case in which abundance at the current time and at the time of birth of each age class (reflecting so-called cohort effects) were the relevant variables, and noted that lags of this form produced damped oscillations. In some species, probability of reproducing in year t is a function not only of conditions in year t, but also of whether or not the animal reproduced successfully the previous year (e.g., some sea turtles, Richardson et al., 1999; some albatross species, Weimerskirch et al., 1987; some whales, Fujiwara and Caswell, 2001). This biological lag can be modeled via the introduction of time lags or by definitions of state that incorporate past performance. Wangersky and Cunningham (1957a,b) considered time lags in the response of predators to prey and in the responses of competitors to each other. Caswell (1972) reviewed previous analytic efforts to explore consequences of time lags and provided additional insights using simulation. May (1973) introduced time lags into models with two and three trophic levels, including vegetation\u2013herbivore\u2013carnivore systems. In addition to the prevalence of time lags in models of system dynamics, the influences of management actions also may involve time lags. Various forms of habitat management, for example, are likely to be influenced by successional processes. These include forest management (e.g., Conroy and Moore, 2001) and use of fire as a management tool (e.g., Richards et al., 1999). In such instances, the state of populations of interest is influenced by the number of years elapsed, \u03c4, since the last management action. There are multiple ways to model such time dependence, including the incorporation of time lags in animal population models and the simultaneous modeling of habitat state as a first order Markov process (e.g., Richards et al., 1999). Williams et al. (2002) discussed population dynamics of some familiar population models that incorporate lags in their transition equations. Notwithstanding these efforts, there remains a need to be able to account more explicitly for previous biological states or previous management actions, especially as concerns managed biological systems. Our objective in this paper is to frame the issue of lagged effects in terms of optimal decision making, and to describe optimal strategies for lagged biological systems. To that end, consider a biological population that is subjected to management over time, with time-specific actions based on current biological status and the projected effects of management on future status. For notational simplicity, biological status is characterized here by x(t), representing elements such as cohort size, population status, or other indices of a natural resource system. Management action at time t is designated by a(t), with policy {a(t)} designating a sequence of actions over the time frame. Biological responses to actions typically are depicted by x ( t + 1 ) = x ( t ) + f ( x ( t ) , a ( t ) , t ) over the discrete time frame {t 0, t 0 +1, \u2026, T}, and by x \u02d9 = f ( x ( t ) , a ( t ) , t ) over the continuous time frame [t 0, T]. Not represented in these equations are environmental conditions and other factors that typically combine with biological status and management actions to influence biological change. The effects of these factors are implied by the argument t in the state transfer function. A key feature of system dynamics as described above is that they are assumed to be Markovian, in that the change in system state depends on the current state but not on previous states. This assumption has important implications for both understanding and management of biological systems. In what follows we extend these models so as to accommodate non-Markovian state dynamics, according to x ( t + 1 ) = x ( t ) + f ( x ( t ) , x ( t \u2212 \u03c4 ) , a ( t ) , a ( t \u2212 \u03c4 ) , t ) and x \u02d9 = f ( x ( t ) , x ( t \u2212 \u03c4 ) , a ( t ) , a ( t \u2212 \u03c4 ) , t ) . In particular, we describe non-Markovian systems that include lags in the effects of system states, or management actions, or both. 1 Optimal control of Markovian populations Irrespective of the occurrence of lags, benefits and costs attendant to management action can be captured in a function U ( a ( t ) , x ( t ) ) describing the utility of action a(t) when the population is of size x(t). In discrete time the value associated with the control trajectory {a(t)} is expressed in an objective functional J = \u2211 t = t 0 T U ( a ( t ) , x ( t ) ) + F 1 ( x ( T ) ) that includes accumulated utilities over the time frame and a terminal value function F 1 ( x ( T ) ) that assigns value to the terminal system state x(T). Thus, the optimal control problem for a Markovian system starting in state x 0 at time t 0 is maximize { a ( t ) } \u2208 A \u2211 t = t 0 T U ( a ( t ) , x ( t ) ) + F 1 ( x ( T ) ) subject to x ( t + 1 ) = x ( t ) + f ( x , a , t ) x ( 0 ) = x 0 . Here A represents admissible policies over t \u2208 { t 0 , t 0 + 1 , \u2026 , T } . In continuous time the problem is maximize { a ( t ) } \u2208 A \u222b t 0 T U ( a ( t ) , x ( t ) ) d t + F 1 ( x ( T ) ) t subject to x \u02d9 = f ( x , a , t ) x ( 0 ) = x 0 , where the time index t can assume any value in the time frame [ t 0 , T ]. In words, we seek a control trajectory {a(t)} that maximizes the objective functional, conditional on system dynamics and relevant system and control constraints. In this formulation, the transition equations act as equality constraints, along with the initial conditions and other operating conditions. For the remainder of this paper we focus on continuous-time problems, recognizing that an analogous argument can be fashioned for discrete-time systems. Unless needed for clarification, the time index for state variables and controls will be suppressed for notational convenience. A solution to the problem described above can be obtained by introducing a costate variable \u03bb(t) for the equality constraint x \u02d9 \u2212 f ( x , a , t ) = 0 , and augmenting the objective functional with the product \u03bb ( t ) [ x \u02d9 \u2212 f ( x , a , t ) ] : J \u2032 = \u222b t 0 T { U ( a , x ) + \u03bb ( t ) [ f ( x , a , t ) \u2212 x \u02d9 ] } d t + F 1 ( x ( T ) ) . The augmented objective can be expressed in terms of the Hamiltonian H ( x , a , \u03bb , t ) = U ( a , x ) + \u03bb f ( x , a , t ) , so that J \u2032 = \u222b t 0 T [ H ( x , a , \u03bb , t ) \u2212 \u03bb x \u02d9 ] d t + F 1 ( x ( T ) ) It can be shown (see Appendix A) that the optimal action a(t) at time t maximizes the Hamiltonian, given any admissibility constraints \u03a9 t from A . This is the well-known \u201cmaximum principle,\u201d so named because it establishes pointwise maximization of the Hamiltonian as the optimizing \u201cprinciple\u201d for solution of the optimal control problem. The optimization problem then is to maximize a \u2208 \u03a9 t H ( x , a , \u03bb , t ) for all t \u2208 [ t 0 , T ] . An optimal value is obtained either at an interior point of \u03a9 t , in which case \u2202H/\u2202a vanishes, or at a boundary point of \u03a9 t . A general solution of the optimal management problem consists of trajectories {x(t)}, {a(t)}, and {\u03bb(t)} for which the Hamiltonian is maximized over \u03a9 t at each point in the time frame, and the canonical equations x \u02d9 = \u2202 H \u2202 \u03bb ( t ) x ( 0 ) = x 0 \u03bb \u02d9 = \u2212 \u2202 H \u2202 x ( t ) \u03bb ( t ) = d F 1 d x ( T ) are satisfied (see Appendix A). Maximizing the Hamiltonian with respect to a(t) typically allows one to identify the optimal actions as functions of the state and costate variables, so that the canonical equations can be expressed in terms of state and costate variables without reference to controls. Thus, the optimal state and costate trajectories solve a system of ordinary differential equations with initial state condition x ( 0 ) = x 0 terminal costate condition \u03bb ( T ) = [ \u2202 F 1 / \u2202 x ] ( T ) , and a(t) given in terms of state and costate variables. This describes a two-point boundary value problem, with integration of the state equation proceeding forward in time starting at x 0, and integration of the costate equation proceeding backward in time from \u03bb(T). There is a wealth of literature on dynamic optimization, and in particular the use of variational mathematics to solve continuous time optimal control problems. Basic references to the optimal control problem and its many variants include Pontryagin et al. (1962), Hestenes (1966), Leitmann (1966), and Lee and Markus (1966). Useful references of more recent vintage include Stengel (1994), Sethi and Thompson (2000) and Locatelli (2001). 2 Optimal control of non-Markovian populations The situation is somewhat more complex in the case of non-Markovian population dynamics. Consider a population with responses to actions governed by x \u02d9 = f ( x ( t ) , x ( t \u2212 \u03c4 ) , a ( t ) , a ( t \u2212 \u03c4 ) , t ) over the continuous timeframe [ t 0 , T ]. The non-Markovian nature of the state transitions is indicated by the lagged state variable x(t \u2212 \u03c4) and lagged control variable a(t \u2212 \u03c4) in the transition equation. The idea here is to allow for an explicit influence of previous actions or previous states (or both) on current behavior. The optimal control problem is then maximize { a ( t ) } \u2208 A \u222b t 0 T U ( a ( t ) , x ( t ) ) d t + F 1 ( x ( T ) ) subject to x \u02d9 = f ( x ( t ) , x ( t \u2212 \u03c4 ) , a ( t ) , a ( t \u2212 \u03c4 ) , t ) x ( t ) = x 0 t 0 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2264 t \u2264 t 0 a ( t ) = x 0 t 0 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2264 t \u2264 t 0 , where the operative range of the time index t is the continuous time frame [ t 0 , T ] . Several points about this problem statement are worthy of mention. First, the lag effect is limited to state transitions, and does not occur in the objective functional. That is, utility at each time is assumed to be a function only of the immediate action and system state. The restriction of lags to the state transition equations is a matter of convenience, and is easily relaxed to allow lags in the utilities as well as state transitions (see below). Second, the delay \u03c4 in the lag effect is time-invariant, with the same lag occurring throughout the time frame. This simplifying assumption also can be relaxed, to allow non-stationary lags in the control problem (see below). Finally, the values of the state and control variables are assumed to be constant for times prior to the beginning of the time frame, i.e., x ( t ) = x 0 and a ( t ) = a 0 for times between t 0 \u2212 \u03c4 and t 0. As with the Markovian problem, a solution can be obtained by introducing a costate variable \u03bb(t), and adding the product of the costate variable and the transfer function to the utility function to define the Hamiltonian H ( x , x \u2212 \u03c4 , a , a \u2212 \u03c4 , \u03bb , t ) = U ( a , x ) + \u03bb f ( x , x \u2212 \u03c4 , a , a \u2212 \u03c4 , t ) , with J \u2032 = \u222b t 0 T [ H ( x , x \u2212 \u03c4 , a , a \u2212 \u03c4 , \u03bb , t ) \u2212 \u03bb x \u02d9 ] d t + F 1 ( x ( T ) ) Here we use x \u2212\u03c4 = x(t \u2212 \u03c4) and a \u2212\u03c4 = a(t \u2212 \u03c4) to distinguish the lagged and non-lagged state and control variables. Because of additional variables in the Hamiltonian, the optimizing equations are more complicated than in the Markovian case. Absent constraints on the controls, the resulting optimality conditions are \u2202 H \u2202 a ( t ) + \u2202 H \u2202 a \u2212 \u03c4 ( t + \u03c4 ) = 0 t 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T \u2212 \u03c4 \u2202 H \u2202 a ( t ) = 0 T \u2212 \u03c4 \u2264 t \u2264 T \u2212 \u2202 H \u2202 x ( t ) + \u2202 H \u2202 x \u2212 \u03c4 ( t + \u03c4 ) = \u03bb \u02d9 t 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T \u2212 \u03c4 \u2212 \u2202 H \u2202 x ( t ) = \u03bb \u02d9 T \u2212 \u03c4 \u2264 t \u2264 T see Appendix A. Thus, pointwise optimality for the Hamiltonian now is described in terms of both current and lagged controls. In the event that the system state is lagged but control is not, the lag term in the first equation vanishes, and optimality is described by the second equation over the whole time frame. Similarly, the transition equations for the costate variable include differential factors for both the current and lagged state variables. If control is lagged but the system state is not, the lag term in the third equation vanishes, and costate transitions are described by the fourth equation over the whole time frame. If neither control nor system state is lagged, both lag terms vanish and the non-Markovian canonical equations reduce to those for a Markovian system. It is straightforward to generalize the non-Markovian control problem as described above to allow for lags in the objective functional as well as the state transition functions. When the more general problem is expressed in terms of the Hamiltonian, the resulting canonical equations have the same form as shown above. However, because state and/or control lags are expressed in both the utility and transition functions, the Hamiltonian itself is a more complicated expression. This in turn leads to more complicated differential terms in the canonical equations (see Appendix A), with potentially greater difficulties in actually finding an optimal solution. 3 Example To illustrate the foregoing, consider the management of a wildlife preserve for waterfowl through such activities as mowing, planting, and establishment of nesting structures. Within reasonable limits, the quality of habitat on the preserve improves as fiscal resources are committed for habitat improvement. However, improved habitat also brings with it an increased probability of invasion by predators, which can have a severe negative impact on waterfowl populations. The management challenge is to maximize long term habitat quality, while accounting for the potential of negatively influencing quality as a result of predator invasion. To model this situation, let x(t) represent the probability of invasion by time t, with 1 \u2212 x ( t ) the probability that predators have not invaded the habitat up to time t. The conditional probability of invasion at time t, given that invasion has not occurred previous to t, is x \u02d9 / [ 1 \u2212 x ( t ) ] , which is assumed to be influenced by the expenditure of resources a(t) at time t: g ( a ( t ) ) = x \u02d9 1 \u2212 x ( t ) or x \u02d9 = g ( a ) [ 1 \u2212 x ( t ) ] . These transitions are Markovian, in that the effect of the control a(t) is assumed to be immediate. In the absence of predators, habitat quality is given by the accumulation of time-specific utilities U 1(a(t)) over the management horizon. On the other hand, habitat quality in the presence of predators is degraded to a level U 2 that is held constant by predation. The average U 1 ( a ) [ 1 \u2212 x ( t ) ] + U 2 x of these utilities can be accumulated over time according to J = \u222b 0 \u221e e \u2212 r t { U 1 ( a ) [ 1 \u2212 x ] + U 2 x } d t , which serves as a management objective. The exponential factor e \u2212rt discounts future utilities to present value, with r the instantaneous discount rate. Depending on the magnitude of r, a key effect of discounting is to increase the relative value of near-term utilities, thereby rendering the control policy more myopic. The challenge for the preserve manager is to choose expenditures {a(t)} that will maximize J: maximize { a ( t ) } \u222b 0 \u221e e \u2212 r t { U 1 ( a ) [ 1 \u2212 x ] + U 2 x } d t subject to x \u02d9 = g ( a ) [ 1 \u2212 x ] x ( 0 ) = 0. The Hamiltonian for this problem is H = e \u2212 r t [ U 1 ( a ) ( 1 \u2212 x ) + U 2 x ] + \u03bb g ( a ) ( 1 \u2212 x ) which can be rewritten as H = e \u2212 r t [ U 1 ( a ) ( 1 \u2212 x ) + U 2 x + e r t \u03bb g ( a ) ( 1 \u2212 x ) ] = e \u2212 r t [ U 1 ( a ) ( 1 \u2212 x ) + U 2 x + \u03bb 1 g ( a ) ( 1 \u2212 x ) ] = e \u2212 r t H 1 , with \u03bb 1 = e r t \u03bb . It is sufficient to maximize H 1 with respect to a: \u2202 H 1 \u2202 a = U \u02d9 [ 1 \u2212 x ] + \u03bb 1 [ 1 \u2212 x ] g \u02d9 = 0 , from which we have the optimality condition \u03bb 1 = \u2212 U \u02d9 1 / g \u02d9 . From \u03bb 1 = e r t \u03bb the costate equation \u03bb \u02d9 = \u2212 \u2202 H / \u2202 x can be modified to \u03bb \u02d9 1 = r \u03bb 1 \u2212 \u2202 H / \u2202 x = r \u03bb 1 + [ U 1 \u2212 U 2 + \u03bb 1 g ( a ) ] , which, assuming constant values for a and \u03bb 1 (so that \u03bb \u02d9 1 = 0 ), becomes 0 = U 1 \u2212 U 2 + \u03bb 1 [ g ( a ) + r ] . Substituted the optimality condition \u03bb 1 = \u2212 U \u02d9 1 / g \u02d9 into this equation gives U \u02d9 1 U 1 \u2212 U 2 = g \u02d9 ( a ) g ( a ) + r . For reasonably well behaved functions U 1(a) and g(a), there is a unique value a * that satisfies the latter equation. Using a * in x \u02d9 = g ( a ) [ 1 \u2212 x ] then produces the optimal trajectory { x ( t ) } = { 1 \u2212 e \u2212 g ( a * ) t } for the cumulative probability of predator invasion. This can be recognized as the probability of one or more predator occurrences in a Poisson process, with Poisson parameter g ( a * ) (Williams et al., 2002). The effect of the discount parameter r can be seen in its influence on a *. Thus, increasing the value of r leads to a higher expenditure of resources, which in turn increases the threat of predator invasion as specified by the Poisson process. The problem is made non-Markovian by incorporation of a lag in the effect of management actions. Here it is assumed that current expenditures to improve habitat quality will influence the potential for predator invasion only after a lag of \u03c4. The optimization problem is then maximize { a ( t ) } \u222b 0 \u221e e \u2212 r t { U 1 [ 1 \u2212 x ] + U 2 x } d t subject to x \u02d9 = g ( a ( t \u2212 \u03c4 ) ) [ 1 \u2212 x ( t ) ] x ( t ) = 0 \u03c4 \u2264 t \u2264 0 a ( t ) = 0 \u03c4 \u2264 t \u2264 0. The modified Hamiltonian is now H 1 = U 1 ( a ( t ) ) [ 1 \u2212 x ] + U 2 x + \u03bb 1 [ 1 \u2212 x ] g ( a ( t \u2212 \u03c4 ) ) , with optimality condition \u2202 H 1 \u2202 a ( t ) + \u2202 H 1 \u2202 a \u2212 \u03c4 ( t + \u03c4 ) = U \u02d9 1 ( a ( t ) ) [ 1 \u2212 x ( t ) ] + \u03bb 1 ( t + \u03c4 ) [ 1 \u2212 x ( t + \u03c4 ) ] g \u02d9 ( a ( t ) ) = 0. The modified costate transition equation is \u03bb \u02d9 1 = U 1 \u2212 U 2 + \u03bb 1 [ g ( a ( t \u2212 \u03c4 ) ) + r ] , which for a constant value of a and \u03bb 1 reduces to \u03bb 1 = U 1 \u2212 U 2 g ( a ) + r . Substituting the expression for \u03bb 1 from the optimality condition into this equation gives U \u02d9 1 U 1 \u2212 U 2 = g \u02d9 ( a ) g ( a ) + r 1 \u2212 x ( t + \u03c4 ) 1 \u2212 x ( t ) . As before, the state transition equation with constant a produces x ( t ) = 1 \u2212 e \u2212 g ( a ) t , so that U \u02d9 1 U 1 \u2212 U 2 = g \u02d9 ( a ) g ( a ) + r e \u2212 g ( a ) t , The solution a * from this equation then is used in x ( t ) = 1 \u2212 e \u2212 g ( a ) t to identify the optimal trajectory { x ( t ) } = { 1 \u2212 e \u2212 g ( a * ) t } . The solution requirement above is similar to that for the Markovian case, and indeed, the optimal allocation a * for non-Markovian transitions reduces to the Markovian solution when \u03c4 =0. It can be shown that the effect of the lag is to increase a * above the resource level that is optimal for Markovian transitions. This leads to improved habitat quality in the absence of predators. However, the Poisson parameter g ( a * ) also increases, leading to an increased probability of predator invasion in the future. Because it occurs later, the increase in vulnerability to predation is discounted relative to the benefit of the more immediate gain in habitat quality. It is the deferral and discounting of this \u201ccost\u201d of habitat improvement that encourages the greater allocation of resources for the non-Markovian system. 4 Extensions The treatment of lags as discussed above can be extended in a number of ways. For example, one can relax the assumption of stationarity in the lag index, to allow the lag itself to vary with time. This might prove useful in accounting for, e.g., phenological development that is cued to seasonal weather conditions. A straightforward approach would be to model \u03c4 as a differentiable function \u03c4 \u02d9 = d \u03c4 / d t of time in the derivations shown in the appendix. For example, the total variation for a system with state lags then becomes \u03b4 J \u2032 = \u222b t 0 T \u2202 U \u2202 x + \u03bb \u2202 f \u2202 x + \u03bb \u02d9 + \u03bb \u2202 f \u2202 x \u2212 \u03c4 ( t ) \u03b4 x \u2212 \u03c4 ( t ) 1 \u2212 \u03c4 \u02d9 + \u2202 U \u2202 a + \u03bb \u2202 f \u2202 a \u03b4 a d t + d F 1 d x ( x ( t ) ) + \u03bb ( T ) \u03b4 x ( T ) , from which the identification of optimality conditions follows immediately. Another potentially useful extension is to incorporate multiple lags. Populations are frequently portrayed using autoregressive moving average models, with the population change between times t and t +1 being dependent on population size at times t, t \u22121, t \u22122, \u2026, t \u2212 T (e.g., Royama, 1992; Stenseth et al., 1997, 1999; Williams et al., 2002). This situation can be handled by including additional variables in the transition equation, and then accounting for them in the derivation of the optimality conditions. For example, consider a system with two lags in system state, x \u02d9 = f ( x , x \u03c4 1 , x \u03c4 2 , a , t ) with \u03c4 1 \u2264 \u03c4 2 . The total variation corresponding to this equation is \u03b4 J \u2032 = \u222b t 0 T \u2202 U \u2202 x + \u03bb \u2202 f \u2202 x + \u03bb \u02d9 + \u03bb \u2202 f \u2202 x \u2212 \u03c4 1 \u03b4 x \u2212 \u03c4 1 + \u03bb \u2202 f \u2202 x \u2212 \u03c4 2 \u03b4 x \u2212 \u03c4 2 + \u2202 U \u2202 a + \u03bb \u2202 f \u2202 a \u03b4 a d t + d F 1 d x ( x ( t ) ) + \u03bb ( T ) \u03b4 x ( T ) , from which are derived the costate optimality conditions \u2212 \u2202 H \u2202 x ( t ) \u2212 \u2202 H \u2202 x \u2212 \u03c4 1 ( t + \u03c4 1 ) \u2212 \u2202 H \u2202 x \u2212 \u03c4 2 ( t + \u03c4 2 ) = \u03bb \u02d9 t 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T \u2212 \u03c4 1 \u2212 \u2202 H \u2202 x ( t ) \u2212 \u2202 H \u2202 x \u2212 \u03c4 1 ( t + \u03c4 1 ) = \u03bb \u02d9 T \u2212 \u03c4 1 \u2264 t \u2264 T \u2212 \u03c4 2 \u2212 \u2202 H \u2202 x ( t ) = \u03bb \u02d9 T \u2212 \u03c4 2 \u2264 t \u2264 T . The incorporation of three or more lags can be handled in the same way. However, each additional lag increases the complexity of the canonical equations, with attendant difficulties in finding solutions for the optimal state and control trajectories. 5 Discussion There is a growing literature on the use of optimal control methods in biological management (Williams et al., 2002). However, virtually all applications describe systems in Markovian terms, absent lagged effects in either system state or controls. Fortunately, the effects of lags in either system state or control (or both) can be handled by a natural generalization of the approach to optimal control of Markovian systems. In the foregoing, the controlled system was assumed to vary continuously and deterministically. Though it sometimes is useful to describe resource system dynamics in this way, natural resources often can be modeled more effectively on a discrete time scale, to account for diurnal, seasonal, or annual patterns in processes such as reproduction and mortality. Non-Markovian control in discrete time can be handled by a straightforward analogue of the discrete-time version of the maximum principle. Again, the non-Markovian problem in discrete-time is more complicated than its Markovian counterpart, requiring additional variables to account for lags in the state and/or control variables. In addition, it frequently is important to recognize stochasticities, as natural resource systems are notoriously susceptible to stochastic influences such as random environmental variation and other unanticipated disturbances. Incorporating stochastic effects in system dynamics requires closed-loop control, which can be handled naturally in discrete time by stochastic dynamic programming. Again, the problem is complicated by the required expansion of the state and/or control space, and the exponentially greater amount of computer resources needed to identify an optimal solution. Finally, adaptive optimization of a non-Markovian system with structural uncertainty can be handled in an analogous way to that of a Markovian system with structural uncertainty (e.g., Williams et al., 2002). However, the computer resources needed to handle the added layers of complexity from inclusion of both lags and uncertainties could quickly become prohibitive for all but the simplest problems. Acknowledgments The author wishes to thank James Nichols and Evan Cooch for their critical reviews and helpful suggestions in framing the biological issues in this paper, and indicating possible solution approaches. Appendix A In this appendix, we derive the maximum principle for Markovian systems, and then extend the derivation to non-Markovian systems with state and/or control lags. A.1 Markovian systems Consider a special case of the control problem in which there are no limits on the control set, i.e., the control trajectory {a(t)} can be any piecewise continuous function of t. A solution is obtained by introducing a costate variable \u03bb(t), which is used to augment the objective functional according to J \u2032 = J + \u222b t 0 T \u03bb [ f ( x , a , t ) \u2212 x \u02d9 ] d t + F 1 ( x ( T ) ) = \u222b t 0 T ( U ( a , x ) + \u03bb [ f ( x , a , t ) \u2212 x \u02d9 ] ) d t + F 1 ( x ( T ) ) . and the search for an optimal trajectory {a(t)} becomes a search for optimal trajectories of both a(t) and \u03bb(t) for the expanded problem. The augmented objective function can be written in terms of the Hamiltonian H ( x , a , \u03bb , t ) = U ( a , x ) + \u03bb f ( x , a , t ) , so that J \u2032 = \u222b t 0 T [ H ( x , a , \u03bb , t ) \u2212 \u03bb x \u02d9 ] d t + F 1 ( x ( T ) ) Integration of the second term in the integrand by parts produces J \u2032 = \u222b t 0 T [ H ( x , a , \u03bb , t ) + \u03bb \u02d9 x ] d t + [ F 1 ( x ( T ) ) \u2212 \u03bb ( T ) x ( T ) ] + \u03bb ( t 0 ) x ( t 0 ) . A variation, \u03b4a in controls induces a variation, \u03b4x in the system state and thus in J\u2019, so that \u03b4 J \u2032 = \u222b t 0 T \u2202 H \u2202 x + \u03bb \u02d9 \u03b4 x + \u2202 H \u2202 a \u03b4 a d t + d F 1 d x ( x ( T ) ) \u2212 \u03bb ( T ) \u03b4 x ( T ) . A necessary condition for optimization is that \u03b4J\u2019 must vanish for arbitrary variations \u03b4a and \u03b4x, which in turn gives \u2202 H \u2202 a = 0 t 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T \u2212 \u2202 H \u2202 x = \u03bb \u02d9 t 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T \u03bb \u2212 d F 1 d x \u2202 x = 0 t = T as conditions for optimality. Of course, x \u02d9 = \u2202 H \u2202 \u03bb follows directly from the definition of the Hamiltonian above. Two points are worthy of mention. First, this result depends on the fact that there are no constraints on a at each point in time, so that a value of a(t) can be found at a point where the derivative \u2202H/\u2202a vanishes. In the presence of constraints, it is easy to see from the variation that the stationarity condition can be replaced with the choice of a in the constraint set \u03a9 t that maximizes H. The other equations remain unchanged. The second point concerns the transversality condition above, which allows for the specification of a terminal state value x(T)= x T in the absence of a terminal value function F 1(x T ). In effect, the absence of a terminal value function allows one to replace one terminal value constraint (namely \u03bb(T)=[dF 1/dF 2](T)) for another (x(T)= x T ). A.2 Non-Markovian systems Now consider a system in which transitions are non-Markovian, in that system dynamics depends not only on the state and action at time t, but also on the state or action (or both) at time t \u2212 \u03c4. A.2.1 Lagged system state In this case, the transition equation is x \u02d9 = f ( x ( t ) , x ( t \u2212 \u03c4 ) , a ( t ) , t ) . Since x(t) and x(t \u2212 \u03c4) occur explicitly in the transition equation, we use x \u2212\u03c4 (t)= x(t \u2212 \u03c4) to distinguish the lagged and non-lagged state variables. The augmented objective functional for this problem is J \u2032 = \u222b t 0 T [ U ( a , x ) + \u03bb ( f ( x , x \u2212 \u03c4 , a , t ) \u2212 x \u02d9 ) ] d t + F 1 ( x ( T ) ) = \u222b t 0 T [ H ( x , x \u2212 \u03c4 , a , t ) + \u03bb \u02d9 x ] d t + ( F 1 ( x ( T ) ) \u2212 \u03bb ( T ) x ( T ) ) + \u03bb ( t 0 ) x ( t 0 ) . A differential change in the control policy {a(t)} induces differential change in x(t) and x \u2212\u03c4 (t), so the total variation for J\u2032 is \u03b4 J \u2032 = \u222b t 0 T \u2202 U \u2202 x + \u03bb \u2202 f \u2202 x + \u03bb \u02d9 \u03b4 x + \u03bb \u2202 f \u2202 x \u2212 \u03c4 \u03b4 x \u2212 \u03c4 + \u2202 U \u2202 a + \u03bb \u2202 f \u2202 a \u03b4 a d t + d F 1 d x ( x ( T ) ) + \u03bb ( T ) \u03b4 x ( T ) . Letting s = t \u2212 \u03c4 so that t = s + \u03c4, we have \u222b t 0 T \u03bb \u2202 f \u2202 x \u2212 \u03c4 \u2202 x \u2212 \u03c4 d t = \u222b t 0 \u2212 \u03c4 T \u2212 \u03c4 [ \u03bb ( s + \u03c4 ) f x \u2212 \u03c4 ( s + \u03c4 ) \u03b4 x \u2212 \u03c4 ( s + \u03c4 ) ] d s = \u222b t 0 T \u2212 t [ \u03bb ( t + \u03c4 ) f x \u2212 \u03c4 ( t + \u03c4 ) \u2202 x ( t ) ] d t , where the last expression follows from (1) x \u2212\u03c4 (s + \u03c4)= x(s), so that \u03b4x \u2212\u03c4 (s + \u03c4)= \u03b4x(s); (2) \u03b4x(t)=0 for t 0 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2264 t \u2264 t 0; and (3) a change in the variable of integration from s to t. From H ( x , x \u2212 \u03c4 , a , \u03bb , t ) = U ( a , x ) + \u03bb f ( x , x \u2212 \u03c4 , a , t ) we have \u2202 H \u2202 x \u2212 \u03c4 ( t + \u03c4 ) = \u03bb ( t + \u03c4 ) f x \u2212 \u03c4 ( t + \u03c4 ) , so that \u03b4 J \u2032 = \u222b t 0 T \u2212 \u03c4 \u2202 H \u2202 x + \u03bb \u02d9 + \u2202 H \u2202 x \u2212 \u03c4 ( t + \u03c4 ) \u03b4 x d t + \u222b T \u2212 \u03c4 T \u2202 H \u2202 x + \u03bb \u02d9 \u03b4 x d t \u222b t 0 T \u2202 H \u2202 a \u03b4 a d t + d F 1 d x ( x ( T ) ) \u2212 \u03bb ( T ) \u03b4 x ( T ) . The optimality conditions for the problem follow immediately from this expression: \u2202 H \u2202 a ( t ) = 0 t 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T \u2212 \u2202 H \u2202 x ( t ) \u2212 \u2202 H \u2202 x \u2212 \u03c4 ( t + \u03c4 ) = \u03bb \u02d9 t 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T \u2212 \u03c4 \u2212 \u2202 H \u2202 x ( t ) = \u03bb \u02d9 T \u2212 \u03c4 \u2264 t \u2264 T d F 1 d x ( x ( T ) ) \u03b4 x ( T ) = 0. \u2061 A.2.2 Lagged control An analogous argument can be used when it is the control rather than the system state that is lagged. The transition equation is then x \u02d9 = f ( x ( t ) , a ( t ) , a ( t \u2212 \u03c4 ) , t ) , and treating the lagged variable as a separate variable with {a \u2212\u03c4 }= a(t \u2212 \u03c4), the optimality conditions can be recognized from the equation for total variation in J\u2032: \u03b4 J \u2032 = \u222b t 0 T \u2202 H \u2202 x + \u03bb \u02d9 \u03b4 x d t + \u222b t 0 T \u2212 \u03c4 \u2202 H \u2202 a + \u03bb ( t + \u03c4 ) f a ( t + \u03c4 ) \u03b4 a d t \u222b T \u2212 \u03c4 T \u2202 H \u2202 a \u03b4 a d t + d F 1 d x ( x ( T ) ) \u2212 \u03bb ( T ) \u03b4 x ( T ) . Using \u2202 H \u2202 a \u2212 \u03c4 ( t + \u03c4 ) = \u03bb ( t + \u03c4 ) f a ( t + \u03c4 ) , the resulting optimality conditions are \u2202 H \u2202 a ( t ) + \u2202 H \u2202 a \u2212 \u03c4 ( t + \u03c4 ) = 0 t 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T \u2212 \u03c4 \u2202 H \u2202 a ( t ) = 0 T \u2212 \u03c4 \u2264 t \u2264 T \u2212 \u2202 H \u2202 x ( t ) = \u03bb \u02d9 t 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T d F 1 d x ( x ( T ) ) \u2212 \u03bb ( T ) \u03b4 x ( T ) = 0. \u2061 A.2.3 Lagged system state and control Finally, lags in both the state and control variables can be incorporated in the transition equation, with x \u02d9 = f ( x ( t ) , x ( t \u2212 \u03c4 ) , a ( t ) , a ( t \u2212 \u03c4 ) , t ) . Following essentially the same argument as above, the optimality conditions for this situation are \u2202 H \u2202 a ( t ) + \u2202 H \u2202 a \u2212 \u03c4 ( t + \u03c4 ) = 0 t 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T \u2212 \u03c4 \u2202 H \u2202 a ( t ) = 0 T \u2212 \u03c4 \u2264 t \u2264 T \u2212 \u2202 H \u2202 x ( t ) \u2212 \u2202 H \u2202 x \u2212 \u03c4 ( t + \u03c4 ) = \u03bb \u02d9 t 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T \u2212 \u03c4 \u2212 \u2202 H \u2202 x ( t ) = \u03bb \u02d9 T \u2212 \u03c4 \u2264 t \u2264 T d F 1 d x ( x ( T ) ) \u2212 \u03bb ( T ) \u03b4 x ( T ) = 0. \u2061 A.2.4 Lags in the objective functional Lags can occur not only in the system transition equations, but also in the objective functional. Here we illustrate the effect of state lags in both the system transitions and objective function. In this situation, the augmented objective function is expressed as J \u2032 = \u222b t 0 T ( U ( a , x , x \u2212 \u03c4 ) + \u03bb [ f ( x , x \u2212 \u03c4 , a , t ) \u2212 x \u02d9 ] ) d t + F 1 ( x ( T ) ) . with a differential change in policy {a(t)} inducing a differential change in x(t) and x \u2212\u03c4 (t). The total variation for J\u2019 is \u03b4 J \u2032 = \u222b t 0 T \u2202 U \u2202 x + \u03bb \u2202 f \u2202 x + \u03bb \u02d9 \u03b4 x + \u2202 U \u2202 x \u2212 \u03c4 + \u03bb \u2202 f \u2202 x \u2212 \u03c4 \u03b4 x \u2212 \u03c4 + \u2202 U \u2202 a + \u03bb \u2202 f \u2202 a \u03b4 a d t + d F 1 d x ( x ( T ) ) \u2212 \u03bb ( T ) \u03b4 x ( T ) . Expressing the Hamiltonian as H ( x , x \u2212 \u03c4 , a , \u03bb , t ) = U ( a , x , x \u2212 \u03c4 ) + \u03bb f ( x , x \u2212 \u03c4 , a , t ) , the differential of J\u2032 has the same form and produces the same canonical equations as for lags only in the state transition equations. Of course, the additional lag in the objective functional is reflected in a more complicated differential form \u2202 H \u2202 x \u2212 \u03c4 ( t + \u03c4 ) = U x \u2212 \u03c4 ( t + \u03c4 ) + \u03bb ( t + \u03c4 ) f x \u2212 \u03c4 ( t + \u03c4 ) in the canonical equations, involving increased complexity in the search for their solution.
