"Ecological ModellingDesign and validation of a spatially explicit simulation model for bottomland hardwood forestsAbstract Species composition in forests depends on the interaction of species traits and species availability. Yet many forest simulation models focus only on interactions of adult trees and saplings, ignoring how species become members of the community. We modify a published forest model for bottomland hardwood forests (program SWAMP [Phipps, R.L., 1979. Simulation of wetlands forest vegetation dynamics. Ecol. Modell. 7, 257\u2013288]) to make it spatially explicit and incorporate explicit seed production and dispersal algorithms. The resulting individual-based, spatially explicit forest simulator (YAFSIM) combines mechanistic seed dispersal with growth and mortality of trees to track forest dynamics over time. We describe the structure of the model and test its validity for dynamics in small bottomland hardwood patches in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. Dynamics of species composition and basal areas of trees predicted by Yazoo Forest Simulator (YAFSIM) were similar to those of natural second- and old-growth bottomland forests. However, diversity of simulated forest patches declined over time largely because of random dynamics acting on small, isolated populations.serial JL 271743 291210 291728 291780 291840 31 Ecological Modelling ECOLOGICALMODELLING 2006-08-28 2006-08-28 2010-10-08T02:45:02 1-s2.0-S030438000600336X S0304-3800(06)00336-X S030438000600336X 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.07.010 S300 S300.1 FULL-TEXT 1-s2.0-S0304380006X04295 2015-05-14T06:43:49.314216-04:00 0 0 20070110 2007 2006-08-28T00:00:00Z articleinfo crossmark dco dateupdated tomb dateloaded datesearch indexeddate issuelist volumelist yearnav articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright dateloadedtxt docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid issfirst issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sectiontitle sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype subheadings volfirst volissue webpdf webpdfpagecount figure table body mmlmath acknowledge affil articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authkeywords authlast primabst ref alllist content subj ssids 0304-3800 03043800 200 200 1 2 1 2 Volume 200, Issues 1\u20132 3 20 32 20 32 20070110 10 January 2007 2007-01-10 2007 Research papers article fla Copyright \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Data shown are the result of one simulated 25-cm dbh tree and is the total resulting germinating seedlings in all directions at a given distance. Dispersal curves for wind-dispersed species are shown assuming dispersal within forest (vegetation height z h =25m) or open field (z h =1m). (B) Area growth increment (parameters BCT) as a function of relative stocking (S/R). (C) Mortality probability as a function of annual radial growth. Species curves follow Eq.

Notice that the \u201cSORTIE\u201d curve is generally highest at low growth increment whereas the species-specific curves are higher at higher (>0.2mm) growth increments. For any growth increment, the observed mortality is the highest of the three curves (species, \u201cSORTIE\u201d, and density-independent). Values for all parameters are found in Table 1.

Abstract Species composition in forests depends on the interaction of species traits and species availability. Yet many forest simulation models focus only on interactions of adult trees and saplings, ignoring how species become members of the community. We modify a published forest model for bottomland hardwood forests (program SWAMP [Phipps, R.L., 1979. Simulation of wetlands forest vegetation dynamics. Ecol. Modell. 7, 257\u2013288]) to make it spatially explicit and incorporate explicit seed production and dispersal algorithms. The resulting individual-based, spatially explicit forest simulator (YAFSIM) combines mechanistic seed dispersal with growth and mortality of trees to track forest dynamics over time. We describe the structure of the model and test its validity for dynamics in small bottomland hardwood patches in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. Dynamics of species composition and basal areas of trees predicted by Yazoo Forest Simulator (YAFSIM) were similar to those of natural second- and old-growth bottomland forests. However, diversity of simulated forest patches declined over time largely because of random dynamics acting on small, isolated populations. Keywords Dispersal Forest simulator Individual-based model Restoration Succession Mississippi Alluvial Valley 1 Introduction The field of forest modeling was for a long time focused on niche-based, resource-mediated interactions among individuals (e.g., Shugart, 1984 and derivatives, Botkin, 1993). A large body of such forest dynamics models has made important contributions to understanding the mechanisms controlling forest dynamics and composition in a wide variety of forest systems. Their focus on competitive interactions, however, frequently explicitly assumed that processes affecting species availability are largely stochastic relative to those affecting growth and mortality of established individuals. Along with competition and the abiotic environment, species availability is another important determinant of plant community composition (Hubbell, 2001). Along with presence in the community as reproducing adults, dispersal from outside the focal community is a primary determinant of species availability. Consequently, a large body of literature has been devoted to understanding patterns and processes of seed dispersal, including phenomenological and mechanistic models (e.g., Barrows, 1975; Greene and Johnson, 1989; Okubo and Levin, 1989; Greene and Johnson, 1995, 1996; Clark et al., 1998a,b; Nathan et al., 2001, 2002a,b; Nuttle and Haefner, 2005). Despite their overall focus on competing adults, spatially explicit forest models generally incorporate some aspects of dispersal (Smith and Urban, 1988; Clark and Ji, 1995; Pacala et al., 1996; Chave, 1999), though none have incorporated dispersal of seeds per se. Rather, the process of seed dispersal is inferred from patterns of seedling occurrence using phenomenological (statistical) models. This method conflates dispersal with early establishment because it is based on observed number seedlings and saplings on the ground rather than actual seed rain. For example, in Chave's (1999) model of tropical forests, seed dispersal was based on estimates of seeds produced, but density of established seedling was constrained to an ad hoc limit of 1m\u22122 regardless of species. Dispersal in other forest simulation models has been either ignored or based upon observed distributions of established seedlings and saplings (not seeds, e.g., Pacala et al., 1996). Explicitly incorporating the different processes \u2013 i.e., dispersal and establishment \u2013 that affect density of seedlings allows their relative importance to be assessed. For example, a doughnut shaped pattern of seedlings around a conspecific adult tree might be attributed to a dispersal kernel that has its mode at some distance from the parent. The lack of seedlings around the conspecific would thus be attributed to dispersal limitation. However, this pattern might also result from a Gaussian dispersal kernel (as in Clark et al., 1998b) with the mode at the parent tree in combination with density- or distance-dependent mortality (Janzen, 1970; Connell, 1971; Schupp, 1992) of seeds or seedlings in close proximity to the adult conspecific. In this case, the process limiting seedling occurrence near the conspecific is not dispersal but rather establishment and survival of seedlings. Thus, basing estimates of dispersal on observed number of seedlings might lead to erroneous conclusions about the role of dispersal relative to establishment. Our goal was to combine these two families of models, seed dispersal and forest dynamics, into a single model that tracks the full life history of forest trees, from adults, to seeds on the tree, seeds on the ground, seedlings, saplings, and back to adults. Our focal system is one where processes of dispersal and subsequent establishment and growth are all potentially important in creating an apparent obstacle in developing diverse forests. The system is bottomland hardwood forests and reforestation sites in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (MAV). We provide an important advance over previous forest simulators by incorporating empirically documented seed-dispersal functions. Levine and Murrell (2003) strongly advocated development of empirically documented dispersal kernels for models that investigate community-level consequences of colonization and competition in plant communities (see also Ribbens et al., 1994; Clark and Ji, 1995; Pacala et al., 1996; Clark et al., 1998b; Nathan et al., 2001, 2002a,b). Our model goes further, however, in that it incorporates not only empirical dispersal kernels (for animal-dispersed species), but also a mechanistic algorithm for dispersal of wind-dispersed species (Nuttle and Haefner, 2005). A companion paper (Nuttle and Haefner, forthcoming) discusses applications of our model to answering questions about the relative importance of colonization versus competition in reforestation sites. The present paper is devoted to a full description of the development of this model and testing the validity of its predictions for natural bottomland hardwood forests, the system from which most of the parameters are derived. 2 Focal system Small, isolated forest patches are a common feature of the MAV (Fig. 1 ). These patches are sometimes isolated by kilometers of agricultural fields. However, starting in the early 1980s, hundreds of thousands of hectares of marginal agricultural lands in the region have been taken out of production and undergone active reforestation (Stanturf et al., 2000; Allen et al., 2001; Schoenholtz et al., 2001). A primary goal has been to defragment the landscape by connecting existing forest blocks with tree plantations, thus creating larger blocks of forest. It was presumed that the full diversity of forest trees in the region would colonize these plantations, and create forest communities similar in composition to natural forests in the region. However, for the most part, tree species composition in these plantations is restricted to the species (even the individuals) originally planted (Nuttle, 2003). Often, the small, isolated forest patches referred to above are the only natural forest communities that could potentially provide seeds of non-planted species to reforestation plantations. Therefore, this paper focuses on developing and testing a model of the dynamics within such patches. Prior to the development of our model, simulation models of bottomland hardwood dynamics were spatially uniform \u201cgap\u201d models (Tharp, 1978; Phipps, 1979). Being gap models, they focus on growth and survival of adult trees and saplings. Both these models assume all species have the same mortality response to low growth, which is a reasonable first approximation, but more recent analyses have yielded improved understanding of this process (Fulton and Harcombe public communication, Ecological Society of America 85th Annual Meeting, Snowbird, Utah, August 2000). Furthermore, both models assume a constant influx of new saplings (not seeds) that must be assumed to have originated via dispersal (or sprouting) from areas either inside or outside the gap; furthermore, dynamics of trees outside the gap as well as transitions from adults to saplings (i.e., seed production, dispersal, establishment, and early growth) are not modeled. Because we were ultimately interested in applications to dispersal and spread of populations, we needed a model that was spatially explicit and incorporated the processes between adult trees and appearance of new saplings. SORTIE (Pacala et al., 1996) potentially provides a useful framework for incorporating seed dispersal in a spatially explicit model, and has been adapted for many different forest types (see http://www.sortie-nd.org/research/sites.html); however, acquisition of the necessary data to parameterize SORTIE for bottomland hardwoods would have required years of additional data collection. The approach we took was to build our own spatially explicit, individual-based model, Yazoo Forest Simulator (YAFSIM), using the best available functions and parameter values from published sources. We used growth functions and parameters adapted from Phipps\u2019 (1979) gap model, SWAMP, mortality functions primarily from Fulton and Harcombe, and seed-dispersal functions adapted from Nuttle (2003) and Nuttle and Haefner (2005). YAFSIM thus tracks forest development starting from adult tree populations, through seed production on the tree, dispersal, establishment, and growth. The present paper serves to test to what extent bottomland hardwood dynamics can be explained by combining our understanding of the key processes of growth, mortality, and dispersal contained in these separate sources. This evaluation is made by comparing YAFSIM's output to that of SWAMP, to field data collected at Yazoo National Wildlife Refuge, and to data and dynamics reported in the literature. 3 Model development and validation 3.1 Model overview YAFSIM is a spatially explicit individual-based model in continuous two-dimensional space that models the full life cycle of trees, incorporating seed, seedling, sapling, and adult stages. Individual tree dynamics are modeled using a discrete time step of 1 year. Trees in the modeled population produce seeds, which disperse following either a mechanistic wind-dispersal or phenomenological animal-dispersal algorithm. After dispersal, YAFSIM incorporates estimates of germination and seedling survival to transition seeds into seedlings (Fig. 2 ). Competition among trees is based on published parameter estimates for tree growth under different stocking (basal area) conditions, developed for a stand-level model for bottomland hardwoods, program SWAMP (Phipps, 1979). SWAMP was developed to investigate the roles of flooding and logging on forest development. To investigate dispersal and subsequent processes, we transformed growth functions from this gap model to a fully spatial representation by scaling tree effects to individualized neighborhoods (ecological fields, sensu Walker et al., 1989) comprised of 1m2 cells surrounding each tree. Each cell would typically contain only one tree to several seedlings or saplings, but each stem influences potentially many neighboring cells depending on its size. Thus, neighborhoods are determined individually for each tree and are defined by the cells it influences; neighbors are trees that share influenced cells. Basal area within a tree's neighborhood affects its mortality probability. Mortality is based on growth and tree size. Fig. 4 depicts the main mechanistic processes in YAFSIM: colonization, growth, and mortality. 3.2 Model processes 3.2.1 Initialization YAFSIM accepts as input a map of tree locations for the forest and reforestation sites. The composition of these communities depends on the analysis being performed. Each time step (1 year) begins with an initialization of the basal area and vegetation height of each cell in the landscape, to reflect changes due to growth and mortality the previous year. These data are stored in two-dimensional matrices of 1m2 cells. 3.2.2 Fecundity and seed viability Reproduction is species- and size-dependent. Each tree >15cm diameter at breast height (dbh, 1.4m) is reproductively mature (following Nathan et al., 2002b). The number of seeds produced per tree is linear with the tree's basal area (following Clark et al., 1998b). We estimated the fecundity, \u03b2 i , of each species using inverse modeling of the best fit estimates between model predictions and seed trap data (see Nuttle, 1997; Nuttle and Haefner, 2005; Table 1 contains estimates of \u03b2 i ). To reduce computations for seed dispersal, the fecundity is reduced by germination and establishment rates of seeds from published field studies (Table 1). These probabilities include the many processes that would cause number of seedlings to differ from number of seeds, including seed viability, predation, pathogens, etc. (none of the species in this system form seed banks; Young and Young, 1992). Determining germination and establishment before a seed disperses does not allow microenvironment to affect these processes, but currently there exists insufficient data to develop a more realistic algorithm. 3.2.3 Mechanistic dispersal by wind The wind-dispersal algorithm is described in full detail in Nuttle and Haefner (2005). Briefly, each individual seed is moved in three-dimensional space from a starting position in the tree crown until it reaches the ground. The seed's rate of descent is determined by its fall velocity, which is based on empirical distributions, and vertical winds. The wind environment determines the seed's horizontal movement and is a function of the distribution of wind speeds and directions and vegetation along the trajectory of the seed. Importantly, in this algorithm, seeds experience winds as they are affected by vegetation in each 1m2 cell, not the average vegetation over the landscape. 3.2.4 Probabilistic dispersal kernels If the species is animal-dispersed (all other species), we rely on probabilistic dispersal kernels to disperse seeds. Individual seeds leave each tree in a random direction and travel a distance determined by a probability distribution. We use the composite dispersal kernel described by Clark et al. (1998a): (1) k f = exp D \u03b1 f c f 1 N where k f is the probability of dispersing distance D from the source, \u03b1 f the mean dispersal distance, c f the shape parameter, N the normalizing constant, and f =(1, 2) determines which of two sets of parameters the function takes. The composite kernel specifies that a proportion p of the total seeds produced by an individual are dispersed by a function that describes primary dispersal, which is Gaussian with c 1 =2. The remainder (1\u2212 p) are dispersed by a function that describes secondary dispersal and dispersal by rare, long-distance dispersal events, which is fat-tailed with c 2 =0.5. Estimates of the mean dispersal distance for Gaussian dispersal, \u03b1 1, are derived from Clark et al. (1998b) and reported in Table 1. Estimates of the mean dispersal distance for fat-tailed dispersal are \u03b1 2 =200m and p =0.99 from Clark et al. (1998a). 3.2.5 Seedling establishment After the initial location of seedlings is determined by the dispersal algorithm, seedlings are initialized with a radius (r) at breast height (1.4m)=0.5mm, height (H) calculated allometrically from Eq. (8), height growth increment (used for mortality function, below) \u0394H = H and radial growth increment g = r (used for mortality function, below), and age of 0 year. Fig. 4A shows how fecundity, dispersal, and germination combine to affect the distribution of germinating seedlings around a parent tree, which we define as the colonization ability of a given species. 3.2.6 Growth Phipps (1979) used a stand-level approach to model growth and survival of post-seedling stages of bottomland hardwood species in response to environmental conditions (including soil and flooding conditions, shading, and crowding). Currently, our model does not address flooding because that process is thoroughly discussed by Phipps (1979) and because we are interested in the highly modified, largely non-flooded, relatively uniform agricultural fields undergoing reforestation. The annual basal area growth increment (A t ) is thus a function of species response to crowding (adapted from Phipps, 1979): (2) A t = B \u22c5 C \u22c5 T where B is the basic growth rate (mm2, Table 1), C the crowding factor, and T is the tolerance factor. B is the mean annual growth increment multiplied by \u03c0 and describes the species\u2019 growth rate in a fully occupied site (see Phipps, 1979). A t is used to calculate the radial growth increment, g t (mm): (3) g t = min 1 , r t \u2212 1 P r t \u2212 1 2 + B \u22c5 C \u22c5 T \u2212 r t \u2212 1 where r t\u22121 is the radius (mm) during the previous time step and P is a parameter (21mm) that modifies growth of small trees (see Phipps, 1979). A site with more competition has low C, which thus reduces growth. We calculate C relative to the amount of tree basal area in a tree's neighborhood (rather than stand means as in Phipps, 1979). Trees contribute basal area to cells within a radius of 0.25H m around them. The basal area of a tree is distributed to these cells i as: (4) S i = r 2 10 , 000 ( 0.25 H ) 2 where S i is the stocking of cell i in mm2/ha and H is tree height (see Eq. (8)). The numerator in the second term is the area in m2 of the 1-ha plots considered by Phipps (1979) and the denominator is the area in m2 within the influence of a given tree (\u03c0 in the first term and denominator of the second term cancel). Hence, Eq. (4) scales the stand-average stocking determined by Phipps to a localized value within a tree's immediate neighborhood. The size of the neighborhood (\u03c0[0.25H]2) was arbitrarily chosen to represent an area larger than the canopy that would include oblique shading. The stocking is assigned to one of three strata based on the tree's r (following Phipps, 1979), so competition is asymmetric (i.e., large trees affect small trees, but not vice versa), as for competition for light (Pacala et al., 1996). Trees with r <50mm contribute to the small-tree stratum (stratum l =1), trees with 50\u2264 r <100mm contribute to the subcanopy (l =2), and trees with r >100mm contribute to the canopy (l =3). Total stocking in each cell in each stratum is the sum of the basal-area contributions to that cell for all trees in the population. The basal area in each stratum ( S \u00af l ) experienced by a tree is the average of the basal areas in all cells within 0.25H of the tree (counting its and other trees\u2019 basal areas). Crowding within a stratum (C l ) experienced by a tree is calculated based on the ratio of S \u00af l to a reference R l (see Table 2 ) determined by Phipps (1979) to represent a fully stocked site: (5) C l = R l S \u00af l 2 , if S \u00af l \u2265 R l C l = 2 \u2212 S \u00af l R l 2 , if S \u00af l < R l . This is an approximation of a Gaussian distribution. We calculate C as the product of C l values for whatever stratum the tree is in and the maximum of C l values for larger strata. Phipps (1979) used the product of the current stratum and all larger strata rather than the maximum of the larger strata, but this resulted in unrealistically high growth values for small trees early in the simulation when subcanopy and canopy strata were vacant. Additionally, we multiplied C for the small tree stratum by an effect of herbaceous vegetation, C h : (6) C h = 1 \u2212 0.75 exp \u2212 0.05 S \u00af 3 R 3 + S \u00af 2 R 2 where the term inside the exponent is the sum of the relative stocking in the subcanopy and canopy strata (analogous to overhead canopy cover) multiplied by a scaling factor (0.05). This ad hoc approximation creates an inverse relationship between canopy and subcanopy stocking and crowding from herbaceous vegetation. Finally, shade-intolerant species are affected more by crowding than shade-tolerant species. Thus (following Phipps, 1979), shade-intolerant species (Table 1) receive tolerance factor T =0.8 when C <1.0 and T =1.2 when C \u22651.0. For shade-tolerant species, T =1.0 for all values of C. 3.2.7 Mortality Mortality rate is based on growth and size. Phipps (1979) assumed that all species had the same mortality response to low growth rate (a common assumption shared by most gap models, e.g., Shugart, 1984; Botkin, 1993). However, better estimates of growth effects on mortality are currently available, and YAFSIM incorporates such estimates from two sources (Pacala et al., 1996 and Fulton and Harcombe public communication, Ecological Society of America 85th Annual Meeting, Snowbird, Utah, August 2000). We used these two sources to cover the full range of tree sizes and to make use of mortality estimates for tree species that occur in our study area. Both approaches are based on carbon balance theory, where trees allocate resources to maintenance before growth; low growth indicates its increased susceptibility to mortality (Phipps, 1979). Furthermore, Fulton and Harcombe's approach assumes that larger trees have larger pools of stored resources to withstand short periods of stress, and are thus less likely to die than smaller trees. Fulton and Harcombe derived mortality functions from growth and mortality measured at 3-year intervals on adult trees and saplings. They included many of the species in the current study; where they did not provide parameters for a species in the current study, we substituted values from similar species (Table 1). Fulton and Harcombe's equation is a logistic function of a tree's height and height increment growth relative to its asymptotic height H max: (7) m 1 = 1 1 + exp ( \u2212 [ M a + ( ( M b H + M c \u0394 H ) / H max ) ] ) where \u0394H is the change in height from the previous time step, M a sets the mortality probability at zero height and growth, M b specifies the effect of tree height (H) and M c specifies the effect of growth. Tree height is calculated allometrically from r based on relationships from Fulton (1999): (8) H = 1.4 + ( H max \u2212 1.4 ) 1 \u2212 exp \u2212 q 10 2 r where H is in m, 1.4 the height at which r is measured, and q is an allometry with units cm\u22121 (converted to mm by dividing by 10mm/cm). Eq. (7) is not very sensitive to extremely low growth rates (see Fig. 3C). Especially for small saplings, we reasoned that a more severe mortality function was necessary at low growth rates, because of the potentially large number of saplings produced and because Fulton and Harcombe did not include small seedlings in their estimation data. Hence, we used the negative exponential function reported by Pacala et al. (1996), which is steeper at low growth rates, and based in part on data from small saplings). Pacala et al. (1996) developed their mortality equation from mortality probabilities of saplings (trees >25cm tall and <10cm dbh) over a 2.5-year period. Mortality (m 2) is thus a function of a tree's radial growth increment: (9) m 2 = M 1 exp ( \u2212 M 2 g ) where M 2 is the decay rate of the function (mm\u22121), and M 1 is the mortality probability when g =0. We used the average value of mortality parameters reported by Pacala et al. (1996) for species that were most similar to the species in the current study. Reported parameter values for relevant species were very similar to each other, resulting in indistinguishable mortality to curves at low g; at higher g (>0.2mm) Fulton and Harcombe's curve yields higher mortality rates. Mortality of seedlings and saplings \u22642 years old is subject to an additional growth-independent mortality m 3, based on survival probability estimates from studies of seedling survival (Table 1: m 3 =1\u2212 s, the seedling survival rate for that species; m 3 =0 for trees >2 years old). We included these empirical estimates because Pacala et al. (1996) recognized that their mortality functions did not produce sufficient self-thinning to accurately model early stages of stand growth. Where estimates of s for a species could not be found, estimates from a similar species were substituted. Additionally, all trees are exposed to a growth-independent, constant mortality probability m 4 of 0.01year\u22121 to account for background disturbance (following Pacala et al., 1996). Thus, overall mortality probability is: (10) m = max ( m 1 , m 2 , m 3 , m 4 ) Fig. 2C shows the effect of annual radial growth increment on mortality for a 10-cm dbh tree >2 years old of each modeled species. 3.3 Model analysis 3.3.1 Model landscape We modeled dynamics of small, isolated forest patches, similar to the many relict bottomland hardwoods stands that are scattered all over the MAV. Each 50m\u00d750m forest patch is surrounded by agricultural fields and reforestation sites; the edges do not wrap around on each other. Adjacent to each of the four sides of each forest patch are reforestation sites, whose dynamics might influence the dynamics within the forest; such influences are considered separately in Nuttle and Haefner (in press). The entire landscape is 350m\u00d7350m. 3.3.2 Baseline dynamics We performed 20, 200-year runs of the model using the parameter values of Table 1. For three of these runs, we continued the simulations for an additional 300 years (for a total of 500 years) to assess longer term dynamics. Each of the 20 runs contained a different starting population of trees, selected at random from sample data from naturally regenerated, second-growth bottomland hardwood forest at Yazoo NWR (see below for collection methods). 3.3.3 Validation We assessed validity of YAFSIM's predictions based on overall patterns of size distributions, densities, and basal areas from natural forest communities ranging from young stands to old-growth bottomland hardwood forests. In so doing, we compared data produced by simulations with those we collected in the field and from published studies. We collected data on basal area in natural bottomland forests in 1995 and 1996 at Yazoo NWR (see Nuttle, 1997). We measured dbh of all trees with dbh>25mm and counted all other trees>1m tall in 108, 0.04ha2 plots in three stands. These plots were the same ones used to provide data for model initialization, thus they provide a basis for assessing replicative validity (Power, 1993) of YAFSIM within the source forest. Additional data for predictively validating (Power, 1993) YAFSIM with respect to longer term dynamics within the source forest were summarized from other published studies on the development of bottomland hardwood forests (see citations in Section 4). 4 Results and discussion The initial populations of trees in simulated stands had median stem densities that were indistinguishable from the samples used to generate them, although the range in basal area in simulation plots was biased slightly low compared to our sample data; Fig. 4 shows the range in initial basal areas over the 20 simulations and how this coincides with the range in real bottomland forests. Simulated plots had lower basal area than sample plots because sample data contained some minor species (mostly shrubs) that were not modeled by YAFSIM. Nevertheless, by year 30, the simulated basal areas became indistinguishable from the distribution of sample basal areas, and the distribution of basal areas among simulations and stands is also quite similar, indicating that YAFSIM captures the patterns of natural variation in basal area quite well (Fig. 3). Such convergence of simulated and sample data verifies that YAFSIM's short-term dynamics are reasonable. Dynamics are similar with respect to basal area and stem dynamics to those described for development of old-growth, both in forests in general (Oliver, 1981) and for bottomland hardwoods specifically (Meadows and Nowacki, 1996; Kennedy and Nowacki, 1997). Reported basal areas for old-growth bottomland hardwoods are 10\u201350m2/ha, which agrees well with model predictions (Fig. 5A). Stem densities predicted by YAFSIM in old-growth are also within the reported range (79\u2013506stems/ha of trees\u2265100mm dbh; Meadows and Nowacki, 1996; Kennedy and Nowacki, 1997, compare with Fig. 5B and C). It is important to note that not much is known about old-growth conditions in bottomland hardwood forests, and the figures referenced here come from only four to five stands with overstory trees 58\u2013150 years old (in part explaining the large range in reported values; Meadows and Nowacki, 1996; Kennedy and Nowacki, 1997). Due to frequent natural and anthropogenic, large-scale disturbances (e.g., tornado blow downs), it is possible that old-growth conditions never truly develop in real bottomland hardwood forests (Meadows, 1994). Modifying YAFSIM to include disturbances of this sort might help clarify the effects of disturbance regimes versus other factors on stand structure. Although as a group, animal-dispersed species dominated the overstorey and basal area throughout the 500 years of simulation, American elm was the single most dominant species for most of the first two centuries of simulation (Fig. 4). With continued mortality and the canopy opening up (Figs. 5B and 6B ), water oak began to overtake American elm as the dominant canopy tree, both in terms of basal area and density in the overstorey; the shift in dominance coincides with the observed minimum of basal area at ca. year 200 (Figs. 4 and 6A). This change in dominance occurred because American elm is shade tolerant, and therefore does not have the ability to respond as rapidly to canopy gaps as water oak, which is intolerant (Table 1; Fig. 3). The number of species represented in the canopy and by basal area declined from 15 to 3 species in 500 years (Fig. 4). This decline occurred because the total number of trees in the overstorey decreased from a median high of ca. 210stems/ha to a median low of ca. 35stems/ha, which was fairly stable from years 200 to 500 (Fig. 6B). As the number of individuals sampled decreases, so does the number of species (a species\u2013area relationship). The community was marching towards monodominance largely because of stochastic processes, an inevitability for small, isolated communities. If the modeled forest were larger or connected via dispersal to other forest patches, the march to monodominance would take longer, and perhaps not be apparent in the timeframe analyzed here (Hubbell, 2001). Whereas diversity in our simulated bottomland hardwood patches declined over time, this does not appear to be a result from the other bottomland hardwood models (Tharp, 1978; Phipps, 1979). These models artificially perpetuate diversity because species composition of sapling recruits is not limited by the subset of species that are actually present as adults. As with most other gap models, these assume universal dispersal and infinite source populations for all modeled species. Some gap models of other systems have modified this assumption slightly by making appearance of new saplings dependent on presence or abundance in nearby patches (e.g., Clark and Ji, 1995). In summary, YAFSIM appears to capture the dynamics of small, non-disturbed, bottomland hardwood patches quite well. As more land is reforested around these forest relicts, it is possible that the stochastic loss of diversity typical in small, isolated patches will be avoided if expansion of tree populations into reforestation sites increases the effective population size. Alternatively, other processes might limit the establishment of diverse tree communities in reforestation sites, and their isolation might be further increased if tall trees in reforestation sites actually decrease seed dispersal between patches; indeed, this effect is likely because tall vegetation slows wind speeds and consequently reduces dispersal distance for wind-dispersed species (see Nuttle and Haefner, 2005). Future research will focus on evaluating the predictions of YAFSIM for tree communities in a forest\u2013reforestation context; some of these issues are explored in a companion paper (Nuttle and Haefner, in press). 5 Conclusion YAFSIM more realistically models dynamics of bottomland hardwood forests in several important ways compared to the other two models developed for the system (Tharp, 1978; Phipps, 1979). First, YAFSIM makes use of improved, species-specific mortality rates compared to the species-neutral mortality rates used previously. Nevertheless, future research should focus on developing a better understanding of mortality response to low growth that is valid over the full range from seedling to large trees. Second, being spatially explicit, YAFSIM allows analysis of all sorts of questions that non-spatial gap models cannot accommodate, e.g., effects of patch size, location within the stand, population isolation, and dispersal. Third, YAFSIM is the first forest simulator to explicitly model seed dispersal based on observed seed rain without forcing sapling density to conform to an expected density (cf. Chave, 1999) and is the first forest simulator to incorporate a mechanistic algorithm for seed dispersal by wind. Incorporation of these improvements has allowed us to shed some new light on processes that still remain poorly understood. For example, better methods for measuring and modeling seed dispersal by animals would be very helpful, especially because seed-dispersal kernels are not likely to realistically model dispersal of seeds across habitat types; indeed, we have shown that habitat transitions profoundly influence seed-dispersal processes and patterns for wind-dispersed species (Nuttle and Haefner, 2005). Additionally, YAFSIM's estimates of germination, seedling establishment, and seedling survival would be improved by further study of processes affecting germination and early mortality, such as damping off and flooding. To apply YAFSIM to investigate dynamics of larger bottomland hardwood stands, it would also be desirable to include functions that simulate larger scale disturbances like tornado blow-downs, ice storms, etc. Finally, our growth algorithm utilizes tree density within tree neighborhoods as a surrogate for competitive effects on growth. An approach based on resource competition for light or soil nutrients (e.g., an adaptation of SORTIE) might allow a more mechanistic explanation of observed patterns of stem density in different canopy layers than the approach based on percent full stocking employed here. We suggest forest dynamics models in general should devote more attention to the mechanisms affecting species availability. By species availability, we mean the presence of sapling trees near any point in a landscape that can compete to occupy an available canopy position (sensu Hubbell, 2001). Unfortunately, mechanisms affecting species availability are among the hardest to quantify and thus remain poorly understood. Species availability is determined by many factors, including the location, size, and vigor of mother trees; fecundity; configuration of the dispersal environment; availability of dispersal vectors; distribution of safe sites; and factors affecting germination and survival and growth of seedlings and saplings. Port\u00e9 and Bartelink (2002), in their review of models of mixed forest growth, recognized that regeneration sub-models of almost all forest simulation models were inadequate. All extant forest models except YAFSIM model the distributions of seedlings \u2013 not seeds \u2013 around parent trees. Specifically, \u201cseed dispersal\u201d, if included at all, affects only the spatial distribution of seedlings, not their total number, as seedling density is generally forced to fit empirical data or some theoretical maximum (Pacala et al., 1996; Chave, 1999). Even so, most forest simulators poorly predicted seedling density (Port\u00e9 and Bartelink, 2002). Errors in predicting seedling density had large and long-lasting effects on stand basal area and species composition for periods of >200 simulated years (Port\u00e9 and Bartelink, 2002, see also Pacala et al., 1996). Although we have shown that YAFSIM's mechanistic dispersal algorithm accurately predicts seed inputs (Nuttle and Haefner, 2005), predicted seedling densities in YAFSIM appear too high (Figs. 5E and 6E; personal observations). After the sapling stage \u2013 i.e., once species are available \u2013 it is also important to understand factors affecting growth and survival because this determines the location, size, and vigor of mother trees. Fortunately, these processes are considerably easier (though time consuming) to measure due to the size and immobility of the study objects. Consequently, they are in large part better understood and well described in a wide variety of forest simulators (Port\u00e9 and Bartelink, 2002).
