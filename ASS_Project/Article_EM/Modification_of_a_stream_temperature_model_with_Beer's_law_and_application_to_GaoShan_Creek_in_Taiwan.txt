"Ecological ModellingModification of a stream temperature model with Beer's law and application to GaoShan Creek in TaiwanAbstract A physics-based stream temperature model [Tung, C.P., Lee, T.Y., Yang, Y.C., 2006. Modelling climate-change impacts on stream temperature of Formosan Landlocked Salmon habitat. Hydrol. Process. 20, 1629\u20131649] was improved by incorporating shading effects caused by both cliff terrain and riverbank dense vegetation to simulate hourly stream temperature variations in 1 day. Daily maximal stream temperature is a critical factor to the habit distribution of the Formosan Landlocked Salmon, an important and endangered species. Currently, it only can be found in ChiChiaWan Creek and GaoShan Creek in Taiwan. The former stream temperature model only considers the shading effects of cliff terrain and works well for ChiChiaWan Creek, but overestimates stream temperatures of GaoShan Creek having dense riverbank vegetative covers. The model was modified with the Beer's law and a parameterization scheme to describe the diminishing of the incident solar radiation to take vegetative shading effects into account. Simulation results of GaoShan Creek show the success of this improvement. The shading effects induced by both terrain and vegetation can significantly affect stream temperature distributions. Simulation experiments were conducted to indicate shading effects are varied in different watersheds and seasons.serial JL 271743 291210 291728 291780 291840 31 Ecological Modelling ECOLOGICALMODELLING 2006-09-15 2006-09-15 2010-10-08T02:45:02 1-s2.0-S0304380006003644 S0304-3800(06)00364-4 S0304380006003644 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.07.034 S300 S300.1 FULL-TEXT 1-s2.0-S0304380006X04295 2015-05-14T06:43:49.314216-04:00 0 0 20070110 2007 2006-09-15T00:00:00Z articleinfo crossmark dco dateupdated tomb dateloaded datesearch indexeddate issuelist volumelist yearnav articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright dateloadedtxt docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid issfirst issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sectiontitle sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype subheadings volfirst volissue webpdf webpdfpagecount figure table body mmlmath affil articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authkeywords authlast primabst ref alllist content subj ssids 0304-3800 03043800 200 200 1 2 1 2 Volume 200, Issues 1\u20132 22 217 224 217 224 20070110 10 January 2007 2007-01-10 2007 Research papers article fla Copyright \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Modelling climate-change impacts on stream temperature of Formosan Landlocked Salmon habitat. Hydrol. Process. 20, 1629\u20131649] was improved by incorporating shading effects caused by both cliff terrain and riverbank dense vegetation to simulate hourly stream temperature variations in 1 day. Daily maximal stream temperature is a critical factor to the habit distribution of the Formosan Landlocked Salmon, an important and endangered species. Currently, it only can be found in ChiChiaWan Creek and GaoShan Creek in Taiwan. The former stream temperature model only considers the shading effects of cliff terrain and works well for ChiChiaWan Creek, but overestimates stream temperatures of GaoShan Creek having dense riverbank vegetative covers. The model was modified with the Beer's law and a parameterization scheme to describe the diminishing of the incident solar radiation to take vegetative shading effects into account. Simulation results of GaoShan Creek show the success of this improvement. The shading effects induced by both terrain and vegetation can significantly affect stream temperature distributions. Simulation experiments were conducted to indicate shading effects are varied in different watersheds and seasons. Keywords Stream temperature Vegetative shading Beer's law Simulation Ecohydrology 1 Introduction The Formosan Landlocked Salmon is a land-locked species currently only exists in the upstream tributaries of TaChia River in Taiwan (Fig. 1 ). It is the salmon that can be found at the lowest latitude today, but becomes endangered due to the development of hydraulic structures and the deforestation for agriculture (Tung et al., 2006). The stream temperature is a very important environmental factor affecting the distribution of the Formosan Landlocked Salmon. The favorable water temperature is between 9 and 17\u00b0C (Tzeng, 1999), and 12\u00b0C is the threshold for the spawning period. According to a recent field study (Yang, 1997), the 12\u00b0C isotherm has moved toward upstream for a distance of 1.56km since 1985. In order to evaluate the impact of natural and anthropogenic changes on this unique species, a stream temperature model is needed to simulate stream temperature distribution. There have been many studies working on simulating stream temperatures. Brown (1969, 1970a,b) estimated hourly stream temperature based on the energy balance of stream reaches, and concluded that the incident solar radiation is a major component changing stream temperatures and the shading by trees along riverbank has significantly influence on the receipt of radiative heat flux. Crittenden (1978) also concluded wind speed, the thermal properties of the streambed, stream depth, and the amount of shading are the most important variables. Leblance et al. (1997) proposed a physical model to evaluate the effects of land use changes on stream temperature. His study identified three key factors, including the transmissivity and the shadow area of tree cover along riverbank, groundwater exchange, and the width of river surface area. Air temperature is often applied as an index to describe stream temperature since the heat exchange between air and water is an important process. Stefan and Preud\u2019homme (1993) found hourly and daily stream temperatures are highly related to the variations of air temperature. Krajewski et al. (1982) proposed a graphical technique to predict average stream temperature. Mohseni et al. (1999) also developed a model to describe the relationship between air and stream temperatures. These former studies usually concerned only simple vegetative shading effect or only provide average stream temperature. In this study, we will revise a model to consider both terrain and vegetative shading effect simultaneously. The local study (Yang, 1997) indicates that Formosan Landlocked Salmon is very sensitive to daily maximal stream temperature. Thus, the revised model is developed to simulate diurnal stream temperature for habitat assessment. A physics-based stream temperature model was developed by Tung et al. (2006) and applied to ChiChiaWan Creek, the primary habit of the Formosan Landlocked Salmon. Only the terrain shading rather than the vegetative shading was considered in their work, because the main reach of ChiChiaWan Creek has wide river surface and cliffy terrain where the influence of vegetative shading is negligible. However the vegetative shading effect might become important to other streams having narrow river valley and dense vegetation, such as GaoShan Creek, the secondary habitat of the Formosan Landlocked Salmon. Thus, the purpose of this study is to integrate the vegetative shading into the former model developed by Tung et al. (2006) for simulating the stream temperature of GaoShan Creek. Besides, the modified physics-based model can simulate both cliff terrain and vegetative shading effects, which makes the model more applicable for other watersheds. 2 Stream temperature model The stream temperature model developed by Tung et al. (2006) is treated as a foundation in this study. The model was designed to modeling hourly stream temperature under a clear sky condition on a day and the clear sky condition is treated as \u201cthe worse scenario\u201d for Formosan Landlocked Salmon. The governing equation of stream temperature distribution is given as (Tung et al., 2006; Kim and Chapra, 1997): (1) \u2202 T \u2202 t + u \u2202 T \u2202 x = \u2202 \u2202 x D \u2202 T \u2202 x + q A ( T L \u2212 T ) + H T w c w \u03c1 w A + H B p c w \u03c1 w A where T is the cross-sectional average stream temperature (\u00b0C), u the mean velocity of stream flow (m/s), D the longitudinal dispersion coefficient (m2/s), T L the groundwater temperature (\u00b0C), q the groundwater discharge (m2/s), H T the surface flux of thermal energy (J/m2s), w the surface width of the channel (m), p the wetted perimeter (m), A the cross sectional area (m2), H B the stream bed flux of thermal energy or bed conduction, c w the specific heat of water (J/kg\u00b0C), and \u03c1 w is the density of water (kg/m3). Eq. (1) can be written as (2) \u2202 T \u2202 t + u \u2202 T \u2202 x = \u2202 \u2202 x D \u2202 T \u2202 x + q A ( T L \u2212 T ) + H T + H B c w \u03c1 w h The digital elevation model (DEM) is used to generate the river network resolving as spatial grids. The surface flux of thermal energy of each grid was adjusted with the terrain shading effect. Terrain shading effect is considered as a dichotomous variable, as shown in Fig. 2 . Direct solar radiation is assumed to be zero when incident solar radiation is blocked by mountain. In Fig. 2, the angle \u03b8 T is maximal angle to have terrain shading effect and the angle \u03b2 is the Zenith angle of the sun. Therefore, the incident solar radiation will be zero until \u03b2 > \u03b8 T. That is the terrain shading effect considered in the stream temperature model. The DEM can be used to determine \u03b8 T. The energy balance in the stream temperature model includes short-wave radiation, long-wave radiation, latent heat, sensible heat, etc. The Crank\u2013Nicolson method was applied to solve Eq. (2), because the method has a property of second-order accuracy in both space and time and is unconditionally stable (Yogesh and Torrance, 1986). It is a popular method applied to parabolic type equations (Kim and Chapra, 1997; Sinokrot and Stefan, 1993). With this approach stream temperature of each grid in every time step can be obtained. The detailed description of model and the equation of radiation balance were given in Tung et al. (2006). 3 The modification of stream temperature model 3.1 The result of previous model The previously described stream temperature model with considering terrain shading effects can provide reasonable predictions for ChiChiaWan Creek which has insignificant vegetative shading effects. However, when the model is directly applied to GaoShan Creek, having narrow river valley with dense riparian vegetation, the model overestimates stream temperatures. The observed stream temperature data on 3 January 1996 and 7 July 1996 (Yang, 1997) at Dam No.1 of GaoShan Creek were used to represent the diurnal stream temperature for winter and summer seasons, respectively. The meteorological data, including air temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and wind speed was obtained from the Sungmao and the Huanshan weather stations as listed in Table 1 . The hydraulic data were obtained from Yeh et al. (1998\u20132002). The relationships between flows and the channel width and water depth were developed based on flow records and field measurements of channel geometry in this study as follows: (3) W = a Q b (4) D = c Q d where a, b, c and d are constants but different for different river segments (listed in Table 2 ). The stream temperature model was applied to GaoShan Creek without considering vegetative shading effects. Due to the lack of the observed stream temperatures of the headwater and all grids, the initial and boundary conditions are assumed to be equal to monthly average temperature, because streamflow during low flow period is mainly discharging from groundwater and groundwater temperature is related to air temperature (Todd, 1980). Besides, there is only one gauge station in the study area. Groundwater discharges from each stream segment is assumed proportional to its sub-basin's area since land cover is very uniform in the study area. Sub-basin's area for each segment can be determined based on DEM. The results are given in Fig. 3 , which indicates overestimates of stream temperature in two cases, especially in the period from 7:00 am to 5:00 p.m. It is believed that the original model overestimated the solar radiation into the stream surface of GaoShan Creek. The reason of overestimate is that GaoShan Creek and ChiChiaWan Creek have different geographic and vegetative characteristics. The main stream of ChiChiaWan Creek has a wider river valley and close to the cliff. Under this situation, even though there are some plants on the toe of cliff and along riverbank, the vegetative shading effect is insignificant. However, GaoShan Creek has a narrow river valley and dense riverbank vegetation. Thus, when the vegetative shading effect is ignored, stream temperature might be overestimated as shown in Fig. 3. Theurer et al. (1984) constructed a stream temperature model, SNTEMP, with both topographic and riparian vegetation shadings. However, their works did not model the attenuation of the radiation during a day. Furthermore, SNTEMP model simulates daily average stream temperature. Although it also provides maximum/minimum daily stream temperature, these values are estimated based on an empirical approach. In order to simulate the stream temperature more precisely in each segment of the river during a day, the Beer's law with a parameterization scheme is proposed to estimate the vegetative shading effect and integrated to the previous stream temperature model by Tung et al. (2006). 3.2 The Beer's law When a light passes through a matter, after interception, a quantum may suffer one of two fates: it may be absorbed; or it may be scattered. The beam is said to be \u201cattenuated\u201d by absorption or scattering (Monteith and Unsworth, 1990). The Beer's law is used to describe the attenuation where radiation is absorbed but not scattered when it passes through a homogeneous medium (Monteith and Unsworth, 1990). Suppose that the flux density of radiation at distance x into the medium is \u03d5(x), the change of radiation intensity at this distance x can be written as (6) d \u03d5 d x = \u2212 k \u03d5 ( x ) where the constant of proportionality k, described as an \u201cattenuation coefficient\u201d, is the probability of a ray being intercepted within the small distance dx. Integrate Eq. (6) gives (7) \u03d5 ( x ) = \u03d5 ( 0 ) exp ( \u2212 k x ) where \u03d5(0) is the flux density at x =0. The Beer's law is the most popular equation applied to estimate the solar radiation passing through the atmosphere or the canopy. When the changes of kx are small, Eq. (7) can still give a good approximation of attenuation of broadband radiation with distance (Campbell and Norman, 1998). 3.3 Estimate of the radiation passing through the canopy Monsi and Saeki introduced the application of the Beer's law to describe the light extinction through plant canopies (Larsen and Kershaw, 1996). Since their work, many scientists applied variations of the Beer's law to model the light environment in plant canopies. According to Eq. (7), the Beer's law can be rewritten as (8) R v = R 0 exp ( \u2212 k LAI ) where R 0 is the radiation density on the top of the canopy, R v the radiation passing through the canopy, k attenuation coefficient and LAI is leaf area index (Campbell and Norman, 1998). The effect of different canopy structure and scattering was ignored in this study. In Eq. (8), there are three parameters that need to be estimated before applying the Beer's law to describe the attenuation of radiation: including R 0, k and LAI. R 0 can be calculated by Eq. (9) (Tung et al., 2006): (9) R 0 = ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 P ) I 0 sin \u03b2 ( 1 \u2212 T S ) where \u03b1 P is planet albedo, I 0 a solar constant and \u03b2 is the elevation of sun in degrees and is equal to 90\u00b0\u2212 \u03b8 Z (the Zenith angle), T S is an index for terrain shading. The value of k and LAI were determined based on field measurements, which is described in more detail in the following section. 3.4 Paramization of vegetative shading effect The vegetative shading effect is considered to happen after the terrain shading effect in this study. The relationships between the Zenith angle, the terrain shading effect and the vegetative shading effect are illustrated in Fig. 4 . Fig. 4(a) gives an example to show that stream is under the terrain shading when Zenith angle \u03b2 is smaller than \u03b8 T. Fig. 4(b) shows Zenith angle is larger than \u03b8 T but smaller than the maximal angle to have vegetative shading effect (\u03b8 v, defined in Fig. 5(a), which \u03b8 v = tan \u2212 1 ( H / L ) : L is the distance between the tree and river center, and H is the height of the tree), and thus riverbank vegetation takes over shading effects during this period. The Zenith angle \u03b2 in Fig. 4(c) is larger than \u03b8 v, and thus the short-wave radiation can reach river surface directly without any shading. Therefore, attenuation coefficient k, leaf area index LAI, and maximal angle having vegetative shading effect \u03b8 v are three kinds of additional parameters required for the revised stream temperature model. Field measurements are required for determining parameters. It is not realistic to measure these parameters along the river in great detail. Thus, this study suggests dividing a river into several sections, and then estimates these parameters for each section. Then, three kinds of parameters of grids within the same section are assumed the same in the simulation model. Besides, because Zenith angle is different on a day and in different seasons, an area is divided into eight sub-areas (I\u2013VIII) as given in Fig. 5(b). Then, the \u03b8 v is measured for each sub-area. In this study, LAI is measured from the field investigation by the equipment of LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer, produced by the LI-COR Company. This equipment measures the radiation above and below the canopy with a \u201cfish-eye\u201d optical sensor (148\u00b0 field-of-view). The detail description of the equipment is given in Welles and Norman (1991). The angles of \u03b8 v for eight areas are also measured directly in this study. In each river section, these measurements were done in several points and then averaged. In the stream temperature model, the position and direction of the sun is known during estimating short-wave radiation. Therefore, the position of sun in which direction is known, and it determines which sub-area's \u03b8 v should be considered. Then, the Zenith angle and \u03b8 v are compared to determine if the radiation is affected by vegetation. In GaoShan Creek, the position of sun is usually in areas III and IV in the morning and areas V and VI in the afternoon. The dividing points of river section in this study are four dams in GaoShan Creek, which canopy is similar within the same section. The locations of these four dams are given in Fig. 1. The measurements of R v, \u03b8 v, and LAI have been made at several sample points in each river section and the average values were used for the same section. The flowchart of the revised stream temperature model is given in Fig. 6 . 4 Results of the revised model The field investigation of GaoShan Creek has been done on 21\u201323 January 2004. Because riverbank vegetation is not significantly different between winter and summer seasons in the study area, investigation for summer is not further done. The items that have been measured were LAI, R v and \u03b8 v in eight directions for each section. The average LAI and \u03b8 v in eight directions are given in Table 3 . The angle of 90\u00b0 for \u03b8 v in some directions indicates vegetation totally cover stream surface. The measurements of radiation above and below canopy can be used to determine the attenuation coefficient, k. The radiation was measured by \u201cNR LITE\u201d, the equipment produced by Kipp & Zonen Company. A statistical approach was used to obtain k by taking the natural logarithm of both sides of Eq. (8) and finding coefficients of Eq. (10) by regression analysis (10) ln R v = ln R 0 \u2212 k LAI The result of regression is given in Fig. 7(a)\u2013(e), which the X-coordinate is LAI and the Y-coordinate is ln R v. According to Fig. 7, the attenuation coefficients k of the five river reaches are 0.2193, 0.3335, 0.2295, 0.2465 and 0.2636, respectively. Since the field investigation was made in winter, the simulation of 3 January 1996 was used for calibration and the summer simulation of 7 July 1996 for validation. The simulation result of stream temperature model is given in Fig. 8(a) and (b). According to Fig. 8, when the vegetative shading effect was considered in the stream temperature model, the simulated stream temperature during daytime can be significantly improved to reproduce the observed data. The vegetation can attenuate the incident solar radiation and thus cause lower stream temperature. Meanwhile, because the field investigation was done in the winter, the simulated result 3 January 1996 is little better than 7 July 1996. The RMSE of winter and summer simulation are 0.34 and 0.49\u00b0C, respectively (as shown in Table 4 ). Because the vegetative shading effect only influences the short-wave radiation, the stream temperature before sunrise has no difference between with and without the vegetative shading effect. 5 Discussions According to the results, both terrain and vegetative shading effects are the most important factors to influence the incoming solar radiation into the upstream rivers in Taiwan. However, a quantitative analysis on the impact of different shading effect should be able to help us understand more about the stream temperature change on a day. In this section, comparisons were made between four different simulation scenarios: (1) without any shading effect (WAS), treated as a basis scenario; (2) terrain shading only (TSO); (3) vegetative shading only (VSO); (4) both shading effects (BSE). Fig. 9(a) and (b) are the simulation results of Dam No.1 at GaoShan Creek on 3 January 1996 (winter case) and on 7 July 1996 (summer case), respectively. According to Fig. 9(a) and (b) and taking the result of the WAS scenario as a comparison basis, the BSE scenario causes the most reduction of stream temperature in both seasons. Although Tung et al. (2006) indicated that the vegetative shading effect is not significant in the nearby upstream watershed, ChiChiaWan Creek. According to Fig. 9, the vegetative shading plays a more important role than the terrain shading in GaoShan Creek. However, both shading effects considered can provide the best simulation results. Furthermore, the shading effects cause different impacts on the time when stream temperature begins arising (TSA) and the time to reach maximal stream temperature (TSM). According to Fig. 9, the observed TSA is during 8:00\u20139:00 a.m. and 7:00\u20138:00 a.m. in winter and summer, respectively. The WAS and TSO scenarios results in the simulated TSA during 7:00\u20138:00 a.m. in winter and 6:00\u20137:00 a.m. in summer, respectively, 1h earlier than observed in both seasons. The two other scenarios with vegetative shading effects predict the same TSA as the observed in both seasons. The shading effects have the same predictability of TSA in the both seasons, but different predictability of TSM. Different shading effects still have the same simulated TSM in winter, but the vegetative shading results in better TSM forecasts in summer. Although the vegetative shading effect is insignificant in the nearby ChiChiaWan Creek, it plays an important role in GaoShan Creek. The terrain and vegetative shading effects may have different influence in different watersheds and different seasons. 6 Conclusions A physics-based stream temperature model developed by Tung et al. (2006) was further revised to integrate both terrain and vegetative shading effects, and then applied to simulate the stream temperature for GaoShan Creek. Without considering the vegetative shading effect causes the overestimate of stream temperature in GaoShan Creek. The Beer's law and a scheme of parameterizing the vegetative shading effect were incorporated into the model, and the overestimate of stream temperature is improved apparently. A simulation experiment was further conducted to assess the shading effects in GaoShan Creek. The results indicate that both the vegetative and terrain shading effects should be considered for the purpose of best predictability. Ten parameters for each river section are required for the revised model, including k, LAI, and eight \u03b8 v for eight directions. Although the parameters can be calibrated by inverse analysis, it is not recommended. If there are four sections, there will be 40 parameters, which may result in high parameter uncertainty and poor predictions. If parameters are calibrated by inverse analysis, the analysis of parameter uncertainty is strongly recommended. These parameters are suggested to be determined based on field measurements. Before field measurements, prior analysis can be done to reduce the number of parameters. For example, because of the latitude of this study site, the position of sun is usually in areas III\u2013VI. Thus, only \u03b8 v in these four areas need to be measured. The modified model has been verified to provide reasonable diurnal stream temperature simulation for upstream rivers which have both cliff terrain and dense riparian vegetation. Both studies of Sekine et al. (1997) and Wildhaber and Lamberson (2004) indicate that stream temperature is an important index of aquatic environmental condition influencing the distribution of fish population. Thus, well-modelled stream temperature is essential for predicting the distribution of fish population. The modified model in this study can serve as a useful tool for future research, such as evaluating the impact of climate change on stream temperature and further on the distribution of fish population. Besides, the model is a physics-based model, and thus it is expected to work well for other watersheds with their own local parameter estimation. References Brown, 1969 G.W.
