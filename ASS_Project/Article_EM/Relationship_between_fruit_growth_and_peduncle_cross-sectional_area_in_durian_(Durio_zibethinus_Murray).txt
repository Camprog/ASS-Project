"Ecological ModellingRelationship between fruit growth and peduncle cross-sectional area in durian (Durio zibethinus Murray)Abstract The relationship between fruit growth and peduncle cross-sectional area in the tropical tree Durio zibethinus Murray growing in an experimental field of Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), was examined. Fruit dry mass was allometrically related to the product of lateral and longitudinal fruit diameters by a power function, and the mass growth rate of the fruits was linearly related to the peduncle cross-sectional area. This linear relationship indicates that the specific fruit growth rate, defined as the fruit mass growth rate per unit cross-sectional area of peduncle, is constant. On the basis of previous findings of proportionality between the fruit growth rate and the rate of translocation of photosynthates into the fruit through the peduncle, it was concluded that fruit growth rate, translocation rate and peduncle cross-sectional area are proportional to each other.serial JL 271743 291210 291728 291780 291840 31 Ecological Modelling ECOLOGICALMODELLING 2006-10-05 2006-10-05 2010-10-08T02:45:02 1-s2.0-S0304380006003784 S0304-3800(06)00378-4 S0304380006003784 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.08.002 S300 S300.1 FULL-TEXT 1-s2.0-S0304380006X04295 2015-05-14T06:43:49.314216-04:00 0 0 20070110 2007 2006-10-05T00:00:00Z articleinfo crossmark dco dateupdated tomb dateloaded datesearch indexeddate issuelist volumelist yearnav articletitlenorm authfirstinitialnorm authfirstsurnamenorm cid cids contenttype copyright dateloadedtxt docsubtype doctype doi eid ewtransactionid hubeid issfirst issn issnnorm itemstage itemtransactionid itemweight openaccess openarchive pg pgfirst pglast pii piinorm pubdatestart pubdatetxt pubyr sectiontitle sortorder srctitle srctitlenorm srctype subheadings volfirst volissue webpdf webpdfpagecount figure body mmlmath acknowledge affil articletitle auth authfirstini authfull authkeywords authlast primabst ref alllist content subj ssids 0304-3800 03043800 200 200 1 2 1 2 Volume 200, Issues 1\u20132 26 254 258 254 258 20070110 10 January 2007 2007-01-10 2007 Research papers article fla Copyright \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract The relationship between fruit growth and peduncle cross-sectional area in the tropical tree Durio zibethinus Murray growing in an experimental field of Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), was examined. Fruit dry mass was allometrically related to the product of lateral and longitudinal fruit diameters by a power function, and the mass growth rate of the fruits was linearly related to the peduncle cross-sectional area. This linear relationship indicates that the specific fruit growth rate, defined as the fruit mass growth rate per unit cross-sectional area of peduncle, is constant. On the basis of previous findings of proportionality between the fruit growth rate and the rate of translocation of photosynthates into the fruit through the peduncle, it was concluded that fruit growth rate, translocation rate and peduncle cross-sectional area are proportional to each other. Keywords Durio zibethinus Murray Fruit dry mass Fruit growth rate Peduncle cross-sectional area Translocation rate 1 Introduction In woody plants including tropical species, growth and ripening of fruits depend primarily on the translocation of photosynthates from other organs into the fruits through their peduncles, with a weaker contribution from photosynthesis in the fruits themselves (cf., Bazzaz et al., 1979; Ogawa, 2002, 2004). The peduncle can be regarded as a pipe for the translocation of photosynthates. El-Otmani et al. (1993) and Bustan et al. (1995) reported a correlation between pedicel cross-sectional area and fruit size for several Citrus cultivars. These observations suggest the possibility of a transport limitation during fruit growth. However, the relationship between phloem capacity and fruit growth is still controversial. Some studies showed that assimilate transport is controlled by sink strength (Kallarackel and Milburn, 1984; Burchou and Genard, 1999), resulting in that the capacity of the transport system is not regarded as a limiting factor for fruit growth (Marcelis, 1996; Garcia-Luis et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2005). There are several quantitative models on translocation within a plant including reproductive organs (Buwalda, 1991; Wermelinger and Baumg\u00e4rtner, 1991; Berardinis et al., 1994). Since these models were based on sink\u2013source relations (Kaitaniemi and Honkanen, 1996), little attentions were paid to the relationship between transport capacity and fruit growth. If there is a quantitative relationship between peduncle cross-sectional area and fruit growth, it may be possible to determine the quantitative role of peduncles in the translocation of photosynthates into the fruit, since fruit growth is known to be regulated by the translocated photosynthetic products (Bazzaz et al., 1979; Birkhold et al., 1992; Ogawa et al., 1996; Ogawa and Takano, 1997). In the study reported here, we selected the fruit of durian (Durio zibethinus Murray), a well-known tropical woody species with large fruits (Idris, 1990; Subhadrabandhu et al., 1991; Smith et al., 1992; Yaacob and Subhadrabandhu, 1995), reaching 17cm in diameter and 384gd. wt when mature (Ogawa et al., 1995), because the large size of this species allows precise measurement of fruit mass. In D. zibethinus, photosynthetic assimilates, equivalent to 125% of the fruit dry mass, are translocated into the fruits from other organs until the fruits mature (Ogawa et al., 1996). We modeled the quantitative relationship between fruit growth and peduncle cross-sectional area, and analyzed the interrelationships between fruit growth, translocation into the fruits through the peduncle and peduncle cross-sectional area. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Research site The present study was carried out on five sample trees of durian (D. zibethinus Murray) growing in an experimental field station of Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) in Selangor, Peninsular Malaysia. The stem diameters at breast height of tree nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were 25.0, 29.6, 27.4, 34.1 and 37.6cm, respectively. 2.2 Measurement procedures In Tree 1, 100 attached fruits were selected after fruiting. Their diameters in lateral and longitudinal directions and the diameter of the fruit peduncle in two perpendicular directions were measured by a vernier caliper (CD-15 and CD-30, Mitsutoyo, Japan) on April 14, 1992. The diameter of each peduncle was measured 2cm from its point of attachment to the fruit. These measurements were repeated on attached fruits 10 times, at intervals of 6\u201311 days until June 30, 1992. Since the tree drops fruits continuously from fruiting to maturation (Ogawa et al., 2005a), only five fruits were measured on the last of these occasions. One hundred and ninety two fruits that had fallen from Trees 1 to 5 were collected from April 11 to October 28, 1992 and the diameters of these fallen fruits were measured using the vernier caliper. Volumes of these fruits were also measured using measuring cylinders filled with water. After these measurements, the fruits were dried at 85\u00b0C and weighed. 2.3 Data analysis Data obtained up to June 30 from five fruits attached to Tree 1 were analyzed by averaging their dry masses and the cross-sectional areas of their peduncles. The dry mass of each of these five attached fruits was estimated from the allometric relationship between fruit dry mass and the product of lateral and longitudinal fruit diameters obtained from the 192 fruits that had fallen from Trees 1 to 5 (Fig. 1 ). The cross-sectional areas of the peduncles of the five attached fruits were estimated from the average of their perpendicular peduncle diameters, assuming that the cross-sectional shape of the peduncle is circular. The cross-sectional area of a peduncle, s, during a given time interval was calculated from: (1) s = d s d ( ln \u2061 s ) \u2248 \u0394 s \u0394 ln \u2061 s = s 2 \u2212 s 1 ln \u2061 s 2 \u2212 ln \u2061 s 1 where s 1 and s 2 are the cross-sectional area of the peduncle obtained at times t 1 and t 2 (t 2 > t 1), respectively. The calculated values of s in Eq. (1) were used for the relation of Eq. (4) in Fig. 3. 3 Results 3.1 Fruit mass estimation Regression models are required for the non-destructive estimation of fruit dry mass using external fruit dimensions. Therefore, the dry mass, w F , of the 192 fallen fruits was plotted and regressed against the product of lateral and longitudinal fruit diameters, D S D L (Fig. 1). The relationship, which was power functional, was given by: (2) w F = 0.105 ( D S D L ) 1.449 , ( R 2 = 0.90 ) where R 2 is the coefficient of determination. From this allometric relationship, the dry mass of the attached fruits was non-destructively estimated. To validate the allometric relation in Eq. (2), the relationship between fruit dry mass w F and volume v was examined (Fig. 2 ). The w F \u2013 v relation was approximated by the following power function: (3) w F = 0.233 v 1.010 , ( R 2 = 0.85 ) Since the value of allometric coefficient in Eq. (3) is close to unity, fruit mass density w F / v is regarded to be constant irrespective of fruit size. Therefore, fruit dry mass during maturation and senescence can be estimated on the basis of Eq. (2). 3.2 Allometric relationship between mean fruit mass and mean peduncle cross-sectional area As shown in Fig. 3 , the allometric relationship between the mean fruit dry mass ( w , gd. wtfruit\u22121) and the peduncle cross-sectional area (s, cm2) for five attached fruits was satisfactorily expressed by: (4) w = 55.86 s 2.820 , ( R 2 = 0.95 ) where R 2 is the coefficient of determination. Since the value of the allometric coefficient is almost three, it follows that fruit dry mass is almost linearly proportional to the cube of peduncle cross-sectional area. 3.3 Relationship between mean mass growth rate of the fruits and mean peduncle cross-sectional area Mean fruit dry mass growth rate ( d w / d t , gd. wtfruit\u22121 week\u22121) was plotted against mean peduncle cross-sectional area (s, cm2) for five attached fruits (Fig. 4 ). While w and s increased with time until June 8, d w / d t showed a linear relationship with s. The relationship of d w / d t to s during this growth stage was approximated by a linear function: (5) d w d t = c s where c is a constant; 14.57gd. wtcm\u22122 fruit\u22121 week\u22121. After the active growth stage finished (on June 8), d w / d t dropped abruptly, becoming negative value during the last period (June 22\u2013June 30). Dividing both sides of Eq. (5) by s gives the following relationship between the specific mean fruit dry mass growth rate ( ( d w / d t ) / s , gd. wtfruit\u22121 cm\u22122 week\u22121) and mean peduncle cross-sectional area (s, cm2): (6) d w / d t s = c Eq. (5) suggests that ( d w / d t ) / s was more or less constant, irrespective of s during the active growth stage up to June 8. 4 Discussion 4.1 Negative rate of fruit mass growth The negative value of d w / d t during the last measurement period (Fig. 4) may be partly due to withdrawal of carbohydrates from fruits into other plant organs. Such a withdrawal commonly occurs in leaves during the growth phase before leaf abscission (Kramer and Kozlowski, 1979; Addicott, 1982). The finding here implies that carbohydrates may also be withdrawn from reproductive organs before they fall. One more possible reason is the result of respiration loss by the non-growing fruit. According to Ogawa et al. (1995, 1996, 2005b), matured durian fruits daily respired 1.2\u20136.3% of their dry mass. Therefore, respiration loss (including nighttime) in matured fruits cannot be ignored although matured fruits also photosynthesize in daytime. 4.2 Translocation into fruits through the peduncle According to Ogawa et al. (1996), the rate of translocation of photosynthates from leaves into fruits through the peduncle (dT r/dt) is proportional to the growth rate of fruit dry mass ( d w / d t ) in D. zibethinus: (7) d T r d t \u221d d w d t Combining Eq. (5) with Eq. (7) leads to the proportionality between dT r/dt and s during the active growth period: (8) d T r d t \u221d d w d t \u221d s Eq. (8) indicates that the specific rate of translocation into fruits through the peduncle ((dT r/dt)/s) is constant, i.e., just as ( d w / d t ) / s is Eq. (6). That is, (9) d T r / d t s \u221d d w / d t s = const . In conclusion, peduncle cross-sectional area appears to be closely related to fruit growth and translocation rates. This result suggests the possibility of a transport limitation during fruit growth. However, it is noteworthy that the specific rates of fruit growth and translocation are constant, irrespective of peduncle cross-sectional area.
