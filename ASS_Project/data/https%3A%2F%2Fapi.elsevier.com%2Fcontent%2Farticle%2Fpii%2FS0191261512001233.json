Highlights \u25ba Analytical models are developed to describe how near-side stops affect car traffic. \u25ba The models determine where to locate near-side stops to limit the damage to cars. \u25ba A bus-holding strategy to further mitigate impacts to cars is developed as well. \u25ba The strategies are evaluated for illustrative cases. Abstract Bus stops are often placed short distances upstream of signalized intersections. Buses that dwell at one of these so-called near-side stops can impede queued cars upstream from discharging through the intersection during green times. Residual car queues can form at the intersection as a result. The smaller the distance between a stop and its intersection, the greater the problem can be. Models are formulated to address this problem using kinematic wave theory. The models can be used to determine where to place a near-side stop to achieve a target level of residual car queueing. In addition, the models are used herein to develop a scheme for mitigating residual car queues by briefly detaining some buses from reaching the stop. The scheme can be applied selectively, so that the times that detained buses depart from the stop are not postponed. The buses are therefore not delayed over the longer run. Analysis indicates that this bus-holding scheme can significantly reduce car delays and queueing. Our models for placing stops and holding buses are shown to be robust to systematic and random changes in car flow. Keywords Near-side bus stops Bus holding Kinematic wave theory Car queues 1 Introduction Bus stops on city streets are often placed in close proximities to signalized intersections. This is done to improve the bus users\u2019 accessibility (e.g., to reduce the walking distances when transferring between bus lines) and to facilitate protected street crossings (TRB, 1996). The choice is often made to place bus stops just upstream of their nearest intersections (Kim and Rilett, 2005), and buses often dwell in a travel lane when loading and unloading passengers at one of these \u201cnear-side\u201d stops. A dwelling bus can therefore impede car flows. Despite this concern, much of the related literature has focused on how these stops affect only the operation of buses (e.g., Gibson, 1996; Furth and SanClemente, 2006; Kim and Rilett, 2005; Zhou and Gan, 2005; Li et al., 2012). The studies that have explored the impacts of these stops on car traffic have relied primarily on computer simulation, and have therefore focused on rather narrow sets of select cases (Joyce and Yagar, 1990; Zhao et al., 2007). To our knowledge, the only analytical models for obtaining general insights in this realm are furnished in the Highway Capacity Manual (TRB, 2000). Those models assume that the impacts to cars created by a dwelling bus are independent of both (i) the distance between the stop and its downstream intersection; and (ii) the range of bus dwell times at the stop. However, we will show that the impacts of the above-two factors are significant and should not be overlooked. In pursuit of this goal, kinematic wave theory (Lighthill and Whitham, 1955; Richards, 1956; Newell, 1993) is used to model the negative effects of near-side stops on car traffic, and to develop schemes to mitigate these negative effects. 1 We note that kinematic wave theory has been shown to be equivalent to cellular automata (see Daganzo, 2006), and that the latter has in turn, been shown to be a suitable means of simulating bus-stop impacts in cars (see Zhao et al., 2007). 1 Car demand for the intersection approach is assumed to be fixed and sufficiently low, such that, in the absence of a dwelling bus, car queues are fully served in each cycle. These so-called under-saturated conditions commonly occur at intersections, even during a rush. When the stop is occupied by a dwelling bus, and when the stop is not yet engulfed by the car queue from the downstream intersection, it is further assumed that cars can maneuver around the bus without delay. This too is a common state of affairs, and one where the thoughtful management of bus stops can yield significant benefit, as we shall see. A problem arises only when the car queue expands beyond the bus stop. A dwelling bus will thereafter constrain queued cars upstream of the stop when they attempt to approach the intersection during a green phase. The conditions (e.g., car demands, bus dwell times, etc.) under which a dwelling bus will not create a residual car queue are unveiled in the following section. We define these conditions as \u201cfirst-best.\u201d The \u201csecond-best\u201d conditions under which a residual car queue forms due to a dwelling bus, but then dissipates in the very next cycle are revealed in this section as well. The section concludes with an exploration of how first- and second-best conditions can sometimes be satisfied by placing a stop a sufficient distance from its downstream intersection. Regrettably, these stop placements can be prohibitively far from the intersection in many instances. Section 3 therefore presents a scheme for detaining select buses from reaching their stops so that first- or second-best conditions can sometimes be realized without delaying the buses in the longer run, even when the stops lie close to their intersections. Our stop-placement and bus-holding schemes are tested using simulation in Section 4 and we see that these strategies can produce significant savings in car delays. The schemes are also shown to be beneficial even when car demand varies systematically or randomly over time. Potential implications of these findings and future research directions are discussed in Section 5. 2 Stop-placement strategies Consider a near-side bus stop that is located a distance, d, from the downstream intersection; see Fig. 1 . We denote: q as the fixed car inflow in the subject direction 2 Left-turn traffic can probably be excluded from q when these left-turners enjoy a protected signal phase and their own turn lane(s). 2 ; LC as the fixed length of the signal cycle; G as the fixed green time; g = G/LC as the green ratio; Q as the car-carrying capacity of the intersection approach; and QB the car-carrying capacity of the bottleneck created by a dwelling bus, including any capacity lost when cars change lanes disruptively at locations upstream of that bus. We assume that the buses\u2019 dwell times are of random durations that never exceed LC ; and that their headways are random and large enough that each bus arrival can be treated independently. Recall our assumptions that the approach is under-saturated, i.e., (1) q \u2a7d gQ and that a dwelling bus will not restrict the inflow of un-queued cars to the intersection, i.e., 3 To argue why this assumption is reasonable, we note that in many cases, QB \u2a7e Q/2, where the equality might hold when the subject approach has 2 lanes for serving q, as shown in Fig. 1. Additionally, buses may often pull aside the street to load/unload passengers. This enables cars to \u201csqueeze\u201d past the dwelling buses, and thus further increases QB ; see Tyler et al. (2002). Finally, we note that the q is bounded by gQ, where the green ratio, g, is often less than 1/2. The methodology in this paper can also be applied to the less common case of q > QB , and more discussion on this matter is furnished in Section 5. 3 (2) q \u2a7d Q B . Traffic states on the subject approach are modeled using a triangular fundamental diagram in a moving-time coordinate system, whereby time travels forward over space at a free-flow vehicle pace (see Newell, 1993). For illustration, suppose that: point A in Fig. 2 denotes the state of freely flowing cars; C the state when cars discharge at the approach capacity; B and D the traffic states downstream and upstream of the bottleneck created by a dwelling bus, respectively; and J the jam state of cars. We denote: w as the backward wave speed in a car queue; and wAD , wAJ , and wBJ as the speeds of the waves that separate the other car states shown in Fig. 2. We obtain: (3) w AD = w ( Q B - q ) Q - Q B (4) w AJ = wq Q (5) w BJ = wQ B Q . 2.1 First-best conditions Following the above framework, the states of car traffic on the approach to a signalized intersection can be shown in a time\u2013space diagram. As an illustration, Fig. 3 shows the states in the absence of a dwelling bus, where the circled letters, A, J, and C, denote the car states that correspond to those labeled on the fundamental diagram in Fig. 2. 4 The waves that separate states C and A are depicted in the diagram as if they traveled at infinite speed; i.e., these waves are shown as vertical lines. This is due to our use of a moving coordinate system for time. 4 The horizontal line at distance d from the traffic signal marks the bus-stop location. Note that a bus can only arrive at the stop in one of the periodic time windows that are encircled by dotted ellipses in Fig. 3. At other times, the bus would be blocked from reaching the stop by a queue of (stopped) cars in state J. We denote as ta the time interval between the bus\u2019s arrival at the stop and the previous signal transition from red to green; and S as the time required of the bus to serve boarding and alighting passengers at the stop. As an example, the solid, bold horizontal line segment in Fig. 3 represents the time that a dwelling bus spends serving its passengers. We assume that the value of S is bounded in the interval [Smin , Smax ]. We thus have the following proposition: Proposition 1 No residual car queue will occur at the end of any green signal if and only if one of the following three conditions holds: (a) The bus stop is located no less than d1 (see Fig. 4 ) from the intersection, i.e., d\u2a7ed1 , where (6) d 1 = q - gQ B Q - Q B wL C (b) d < d 1, ta \u2a7d gLC \u2212 \u03c4 1 (i.e., the bus arrives to the left of line U1V1 in Fig. 4), and S\u2a7d\u03c41, where (7) \u03c4 1 = gQ - q Q - Q B L C ; or (c) d < d 1, ta > gLC \u2212 \u03c4 1 (i.e., the bus arrives to the right of U1V1 in Fig. 4), and (8) S \u2a7d L C + \u03c4 1 - t a + d w . The proof of this proposition is furnished in Appendix A. Note that it is often impractical to constrain S (and sometimes ta ) within the desirable range given above. Thus to guarantee that first-best conditions are achieved, the stop may need to be placed at least d 1 from the intersection. Further note that if q \u2a7d gQB , then we have d 1 \u2a7d0 from (6), and \u03c4 1 \u2a7e gLC from (7). These conditions would mean that a dwelling bus may impose limited delays to cars as they discharge into the intersection, but no residual car queue will exist at the end of a green time. This would be true regardless of where the stop is located and for any durations that dwelling buses serve passengers there. 2.2 Second-best conditions First-best conditions are often unobtainable, as we shall see in Section 2.3. Thus, we now examine the second-best conditions, under which some queued cars might stop twice at the intersection due to a dwelling bus, but the residual car queue will fully clear within the very next cycle. Proposition 2 No residual car queue will persist for more than one signal cycle if and only if one of the following four conditions is satisfied (see Fig. 5 ): (a) The bus stop is located no less than d2 from the intersection, where (9) d 2 = 2 q - g ( Q + Q B ) Q - Q B wL C (b) d < d 2, ta \u2a7d gLC \u22122\u03c4 1 (i.e., the bus arrives to the left of U2V2 ), and S \u2a7d2\u03c4 1; (c) d < d 2, gLC \u22122\u03c4 1 \u2a7d ta \u2a7d gLC \u2212 \u03c4 1 (i.e., the bus arrives between U2V2 and U1V1 ), and (10) S \u2a7d ( 1 - g ) L C + 2 \u03c4 1 + d w ; or (d) d < d 2, ta > gLC \u2212 \u03c4 1 (i.e., the bus arrives to the right of U1V1 ), and (11) S \u2a7d L C + 2 \u03c4 1 - t a + d w . The proof of this proposition is furnished in Appendix B. Note that if 2q \u2a7d g(Q + QB ), we have d 2 \u2a7d0 and 2\u03c4 1 \u2a7e gLC ; i.e., the second-best conditions will always be achieved, regardless of where the stop is located and when a bus dwells there to serve its passengers. These second-best conditions offer transit planners a greater range of distance over which to place a near-side stop. This matter is illustrated next. 2.3 Parametric analysis We now use (6) and (9) to examine the required distances between stop and intersection for some typical cases. Fig. 6 a and b present values of d 1 needed for first-best conditions (dashed curves) and d 2 for second-best conditions (dotted curves). These are shown for a range of inflow-to-capacity ratios for cars, q/Q. The figures were constructed for w =7m/s and LC =90s. Cases are explored for capacity ratios QB /Q =0.5 and 0.667 in Fig. 6a and b, respectively; and for g =0.4 and 0.6 in both figures. The solid curves in both figures display values of, defined as the maximum distance that a car queue will reach when not impacted by a dwelling bus. Thus, a near-side stop located from the intersection will not impose any delays on cars. This distance is given by: (12) d max = ( 1 - g ) q Q - q wL C . The figures reveal that all curves increase monotonically with car demand, q/Q. This implies that when one is selecting the location for a near-side stop where car demand varies systematically over the day, it may make sense to select the location based on the day\u2019s highest demand. The figures further show that the dashed curves often lie well below their solid counterparts. Thus, we see the greater flexibility one has in locating a stop by forgoing efforts to eliminate car delays entirely and choosing first-best conditions instead. Interestingly, even greater vertical displacements can occur between a dotted line and its dashed counterpart. Hence we see that still greater flexibility can come by accepting second-best conditions. However, the figures also show how both d 2 and d 1 can approach dmax as q/Q increases. Note too that required distances in these instances can be quite long relative to the length of a typical city block. It thus appears that realizing even second-best conditions is not always feasible via the choice of stop location alone. Fortunately, it seems that first- and second-best conditions can still be realized in many instances by using the strategy described next. 3 A bus-holding strategy The propositions of the previous section show that residual car queues can be induced not only by the choice of d, but by other factors as well, including a bus\u2019s arrival time at the stop, denoted ta . Fortunately, it is sometimes possible to alter a bus\u2019s arrival to mitigate the damage that would otherwise be done to car traffic, and to do so without delaying the bus in the longer run. This idea is described below. When a bus\u2019s predicted arrival time at a stop would be damaging to cars, this arrival would, in some instances, be postponed to a more opportune time. Drivers of these \u201cheld\u201d buses would be instructed to temporarily halt (or slow-down) in their lane in advance of the stop. The strategy is technically feasible: bus arrival times can be reliably predicted over the short run (e.g., when buses are equipped with GPS devices); and the holding instruction could be delivered in automated fashion via wireless communication technology. Recall that a bus that is halted or slowed in its lane at a distance of at least dmax from the intersection will not, in itself, impede the discharge flow of cars into the intersection given our assumption of a sufficiently low car inflow, q. 5 A slowed or halted bus can induce lane-changing maneuvers among cars at locations further upstream that create additional delays for cars. However, since q < Q B , these delays would often be modest compared to the delays that the cars experience at the signal. We thus ignore the car delays created by holding a bus upstream of its stop. 5 And all passengers would soon thereafter be served at the stop. Very importantly, the holding strategy could be selectively imposed only on some buses, so that buses are never delayed in departing from the stop. Thus, the only stake-holders who would be made worse-off by the strategy are those passengers on a \u201cheld\u201d bus who alight at the coming stop. As we shall see, their delays would be modest; i.e., less than a signal cycle length. Details come next. Consider the time\u2013space diagram in Fig. 7 a. By virtue of Proposition 1, we find that residual car queues will occur at the intersection if any portion of a bus\u2019s dwell time at the stop falls within the shaded areas of the figure. The solid horizontal line represents a bus that arrives at the stop located distance d from the downstream traffic signal. Suppose that if left to its own devices the bus would arrive at a time after the start of the previous green phase, and the period that it would spend serving boarding and alighting passengers there is denoted by the length of the solid horizontal line. Note that the bus\u2019s arrival lies within a shaded area, and would thus be damaging to car traffic. Further note that the bus finishes serving passengers at a time that lies to the left of point P in the figure. Yet, the bus cannot depart the stop immediately thereafter. It must wait instead for part of the car queue to dissipate during the next green phase. The bus therefore departs the stop at the time denoted by point P, and departs the downstream intersection at the time denoted by P\u2032 (shown in moving time). Note now the bold, dashed horizontal line in Fig. 7a. It is the solid line shifted forward in time. This shifted dashed line does not lie within a shaded area of the figure. Moreover, the period spent serving passengers at the stop ends by point P. The bus still departs the stop at the time coinciding with P, and then departs the intersection at the time coinciding with P\u2032. Thus, by deferring the bus\u2019s arrival at the stop to a time that lies to the right of the vertical line U 1 V 1 in the figure, interruptions to discharging cars would be diminished or even eliminated. 6 Consideration of Fig. 7a shows that if the bus arrival can be postponed to a time that coincides with the line U 1 V 1, then the disruptions to cars will be diminished and residual queues will not form at the intersection. And if the bus arrival can be further postponed to a time that lies at or to the right of the vertical line U 0 V 0 as in the figure, then car interruptions would be eliminated entirely. 6 Yet, the bus can still serve all of its passengers and then depart the stop without encountering delay in the longer run. Regrettably, not all damaging bus arrivals can be so easily remedied. Imagine a bus that arrives at the stop at an earlier time that lies to the left of line IH, and with a dwell time that extends into the shaded area bounded to the left by line EV 1 (see the solid, horizontal line in Fig. 7b). In this case, postponing the bus might be objectionable: Fig. 7b shows that a postponement would delay the early bus\u2019s departure from the stop until the time corresponding to point P. Advancing the bus\u2019s arrival at the stop might preclude the dwell time from penetrating a shaded region in the figure. Advancing a bus arrival is probably infeasible, however. Fortunately, bus dwell times in cases like this latter one might often persist for only short initial periods of car discharge; i.e., note how the solid horizontal line in Fig. 7b penetrates a shaded region for a limited time. This occurs, in part, because bus passengers can be served during the traffic signal\u2019s red phases (Newell, 1989). All else equal, the shorter the periods that buses constrain car queues, the lower the damages. Thus, we focus now on cases like the one in Fig. 7a, and explore the range of bus arrival times for which our holding strategy can be used without imposing long-run delays on buses. Since candidate arrivals for this strategy fall in shaded areas like EU 1 V 1 in the figure, we have the constraints: (13) t a \u2a7e d w , and (14) t a \u2a7d gL C - \u03c4 1 . Further, a bus would not qualify for holding if its dwell time (in the absence of holding) could possibly extend into the shaded area to the right of line KL. In this instance, the bus\u2019s departure time from the stop would fall beyond point P; see the example shown again with a solid, horizontal line in Fig. 7c. If this bus were to have been held, its departure from the stop would only be further delayed in time. Thus, we have the constraint: (15) t a + S max \u2a7d L C + d w . Similarly, a bus would not qualify for holding if its (un-held) dwell time could possibly end before the queue of jammed cars expanded beyond the bus stop; see the solid, horizontal line in Fig. 7d. In this case, the bus would depart the stop to join the tail of the car queue somewhere downstream, and eventually depart the stop at a time in advance of point P. An example trajectory for this bus is shown in Fig. 7d with small, dashed lines. Note that holding this bus would delay what would otherwise have been an early departure from the stop. Thus we have: (16) t a + S min \u2a7e t q , where tq is the time interval from the start of the previous green phase (labeled point E in Fig. 7a\u2013d) to the time when the tail of the car queue expands to the bus stop. Two cases are to be considered when determining tq . These are shown in Fig. 8 a and b. In the first case (Fig. 8a), the bus arrives at the stop at the point labeled W 1, which is relatively soon after the start of the green. The resulting queue of discharging cars that forms upstream of the dwelling bus (a queue of state D) persists when the car queue from the following red period (of state J) eventually reaches the bus-stop. This meeting of the two queued car states is labeled Y in the figure. The bus would be a candidate for holding only if the time required to serve its passengers extends to Y or beyond, but not beyond P. A bus trajectory for this case is exemplified by short, dashed lines in Fig. 8a. Note how the departure time from the stop in this case (point P) could be unaltered by temporarily holding the bus\u2019s arrival. The second case (Fig. 8b) is like the first, except that the bus arrival at the stop (point W 2) occurs later in time. As a result, the car queue of state D dissipates prior to the next arrival of the jammed queue at the bus stop, again labeled Y. As in the previous case, the bus is a candidate for holding if its time spent serving passengers extends at least to Y, but not beyond P. From the geometries of Fig. 8a and b, we find the values of tq that render buses candidates for holding: (17) t q = dQ wQ B + gL C , if d w \u2a7d t a \u2a7d q - gQ B Q - Q B L C - dQ ( Q B - q ) wQ B ( Q - Q B ) , dQ wq + ( g Q B + q q - 1 ) L C + Q - Q B q t a , if q - gQ B Q - Q B L C - dQ ( Q B - q ) wQ B ( Q - Q B ) \u2a7d t a \u2a7d q - gQ B Q - Q B L C . The top and bottom equations of (17) correspond to the cases in Fig. 8a and b, respectively. The constraints in (13)\u2013(17) collectively bound a region, like the shaded one in Fig. 9 . The boundary line RT is from (14); OR is from (15); MN and TM are determined from (16), where the values of tq come from (17); and (13) is a slack constraint in this example. The slope of TM is non-negative if q + QB \u2212 Q \u2a7d0, and negative otherwise; see (16) and the bottom equation of (17). An example of this latter case is shown with dotted line MT\u2032 in the figure. Buses with arrivals that fall within this shaded region are suitable for holding. An example arrival of this kind is shown in Fig. 9 with an \u201cX\u201d. The arrow originating from the \u201cX\u201d depicts the maximum duration over which this bus arrival can be held. The shaded region unveils useful insights. For example, moving the bus arrival to the right of line U 2 V 2 (such that the \u201cX\u201d lies between that line and boundary OR) would, by virtue of Proposition 2, produce second-best conditions. Recall that moving the arrival all the way to the boundary OR would mean lower delays for cars (though greater delay for bus passengers who alight at the stop). Thus, we see from the figure that the range of arrivals suitable for holding expands as d diminishes. This means that the holding strategy can be especially beneficial to cars when bus stops lie close to their downstream intersections. As we saw in Section 2, obtaining even second-best conditions can, in the absence of bus-holding, be impossible for a stop placed close to the intersection. Holding buses can also benefit cars when the stop is located well upstream of the intersection. For example, if a bus stop location were to fall within the spatial range that corresponds to boundary RT in Fig. 9, then by virtue of Proposition 1, first-best conditions can be obtained by pushing bus arrivals to that boundary. If the shaded region in Fig. 9 can be enlarged, and if bus arrivals that fall within the region can be pushed to the line U 0 V 0, we find that a dwelling bus would not induce any delays to cars at all. Interestingly, assessments of (13\u201317) show that the shaded pentagon MNORT shrinks as q decreases. Thus we might conservatively opt to use a lower estimate of q in these formulae when an accurate prediction of q is difficult to obtain. By doing so, we would lose some of the benefits brought by the holding strategy, but would make certain that most held buses are not delayed over the longer run. Further analysis shows that the size of the shaded region increases when Smax \u2212 Smin decreases. Thus, cars can benefit more from the bus-holding strategy if the variation in the time required to serve bus passengers is somehow kept small. This and other properties of the holding strategy are illustrated next by means of examples. 4 Analysis of car delays The Cell Transmission Model (Daganzo, 1994) is used next to evaluate the favorable impacts of our stop-placement and bus-holding schemes for select scenarios. Each simulated scenario emulates traffic over a number of consecutive signal cycles that is sufficient to capture the full effects of a dwelling bus. And each scenario reflects distinct q, d, or distribution of S. All scenarios feature a bus that seeks to arrive and dwell at a near-side stop at a time that is uniformly distributed within the first cycle. For each scenario, 10,000 simulations were performed. From these 10,000 realizations, we obtained the average additional car delay created by the dwelling bus, both with and without bus holding. We take as fixed inputs for all scenarios: Q =1vehicle/s, QB =0.5vehicle/s, LC =90s, g =0.5, and w =7m/s. For our first battery of simulations, S was uniformly distributed with Smin =35s and Smax =55s. Fig. 10 presents the expected additional car delays for the range of d shown and for q/Q =0.4 and 0.47. The latter ratio is just below 0.5, which is the upper bound due to our choices of Q , QB , and g; see (1) and (2). The bold, dashed curves in the figure display the additional car delays when the bus holding strategy is used. Their solid counterparts display these added delays in the absence of bus holding. The vertical deviations between a bold, dashed curve and its solid counterpart unveil the car delays that are saved by the holding strategy. Further note how these deviations: are maximum when d =0; diminish rapidly as d increases; and disappear for sufficiently large d. All this is consistent with the findings reported in Section 3. Fig. 10 also shows how bus holding can provide greater benefit to cars when car demand, q, is relatively high. For example, when q/Q =0.47 and d =0 the car delay collectively saved via bus holding is around 1000 car-sec. 7 For illustration, we note that this savings comes to 8s per car for the case of a bus arrival rate of 1 bus per three signal cycles. 7 This saving is large when one considers that in the absence of a dwelling bus, the collective car delay is only about 900 car-sec per cycle. Moreover, these delay savings are rather insensitive to moderate levels of stochastic variation in q. This is evidenced by the thin, dotted curves for both values of q/Q. These dotted curves show typical outcomes of bus holding when stochastic variations in q are considered. For the cases shown in Fig. 10, we assumed that in every (1-s) clock tick of the Cell Transmission Model, the actual rate of vehicle arrivals is drawn independently from a uniform distribution that is between 82% and 118% of its mean value, q. Though not shown in Fig. 10, similarly produced curves with randomly-varying q were found to gradually deviate from their bold, dashed counterparts as the variation was allowed to increase beyond the (moderate) bounds given above. This was to be expected, of course. From the simulations we further find that for d =0, the expected bus holding time is 7.4s when q/Q =0.47 and 5.6 s when q/Q =0.40. These expected times are small when compared against the savings in car delays. We next explore how the impacts of bus holding depend upon the variations in bus dwell time. To this end, we fix d =0 and the average bus dwell time to be 45s, but allow the variation in bus dwell time, Smax \u2212 Smin , to range from 0 to 60s. Outcomes are shown in Fig. 11 . Note from this figure that the car delay saved by bus holding is greatest when bus dwell time is deterministic; i.e., when Smax \u2212 Smin =0. Note too how these savings: diminish as Smax \u2212 Smin increase; and eventually vanish when this difference is sufficiently large. Hence we see the value of limiting the variation in bus dwell time. Additional considerations for selecting bus-stop locations and for implementing the bus-holding strategy are discussed next. 5 Conclusions When a car queue spills-over beyond a near-side bus stop, a bus dwelling there in a lane will constrain the queued cars upstream during the green time. Kinematic wave theory was used to explore ways of mitigating this damage. The resulting models can be used to determine a stop\u2019s location to meet a specified objective. For example, one might choose to eliminate car delays completely by placing the stop upstream of the fully-expanded car queue. Or, one can opt to limit, but not eliminate, these delays by locating the stop so that a residual car queue created by a dwelling bus will not arise (first-best conditions), or will arise, but dissipate within the following cycle (second-best conditions). Of course, the choice of a stop\u2019s location entails a trade-off between limiting the damage to car traffic and maintaining accessibility to bus users, e.g., to those who walk to the bus stop. This latter consideration favors placing a stop a short distance from an intersection, often rendering the distances required even to achieve second-best conditions undesirable. One might therefore choose to diminish the required distances between a near-side stop and its intersection by either increasing the traffic signal\u2019s green ratio or decreasing its cycle length (see again (6) and (9)). Or, one can both, choose a stop location and employ our proposed strategy for deferring some bus arrivals at that stop. A bus that halts (or slows-down) in its lane in advance of the stop would be nearly harmless under the car demands for which our strategies are appropriate; and the holding strategy would be imposed selectively, so that buses would not fall behind their long-run schedules. Simulations indicate that the favorable impacts of these ideas can be considerable, particularly when car demand is relatively high or when the variation in bus dwell time can be kept small. As a practical matter, bus passengers might by-and-large object to temporarily halting upstream of a stop. This could be the case even though the only passengers made worse-off would be those who alight at that coming stop; and even though the holding strategy can make it possible to locate stops closer to intersections to enhance bus-user access. These objections might be lessened by having select buses slow, rather than halt, in advance of the stop. In some cases (e.g., when buses carry relatively few onboard occupants), a transport authority might elect to impose small delays on buses in the interest of mitigating car congestion. Candidate buses for this policy would include those that might finish serving their passengers before the car queue expands beyond the stop. Left to their own devices, drivers of some of these buses would depart the stop and join the tail of the expanding car queue somewhere downstream. Each of these buses would eventually discharge through the intersection during the following green time. Should these buses instead be held upstream, this could be done in such way that each still discharges from the intersection during the following green. But some of these buses would do so from a position that is further back in the car queue; i.e., these buses would suffer delay, but the delay would be modest. Our strategies are based on a single, fixed car demand, q. As a practical matter, the q to be used when choosing a suitable stop location and/or when evaluating the benefits of bus holding might be the maximum rate observed during a rush. After all, this is when a dwelling bus will do the most damage to cars. Further, random fluctuations in car flow tend to be smaller during the rush. Simulations have verified that our strategies are robust to moderate levels of randomness in q (see again Fig. 10). The effects of random fluctuations will be further explored in future work. We also plan to explore cases when cars arrive in batched fashion due to the presence of a nearby signalized intersection upstream. Finally, the strategies proposed here are suitable for cases when q < QB . With modest alterations, our methods can be applied to the less common case of q > QB . In this latter case, a dwelling bus will impede cars even before the queue from the downstream intersection has engulfed the stop. Our preliminary analysis shows that as a result, residual car queues can arise even when d > dmax , meaning that first- and even second-best conditions can be violated for any choice of d. Thus, bus holding or other strategies for mitigating car congestion become especially important when q > QB , and this too we intend to explore in future work.

Appendix A Proof of Proposition 1 in Section 2.2 The dwell time of a bus can be divided into a few segments (see Fig. A1 for an example), some of which are inside the dotted ellipses (we term these latter segments \u201cblocking segments\u201d), while others are outside. Since we assume S \u2a7d LC , a dwell time can include at most two blocking segments as in Fig. A1. To prove Proposition 1, we first prove the following lemma in regard to blocking segments. Lemma 1 No residual queue will occur at the end of any green signal if and only if each blocking segment of the bus dwell time either: (a) starts to the left of U1V1 (see Fig. A2 ), and is no longer than \u03c41; or (b) starts to the right of U 1 V 1. These conditions are illustrated in Fig. A2, where each bold line represents a typical blocking segment that satisfies the above conditions. Proof of Lemma 1 First consider the case when the blocking segment starts to the left of U 1 V 1, as shown in Fig. A3 . From Fig. A3, it can be seen that a segment of the green period is blocked by the dwelling bus, during which time cars can discharge only at rate QB . We denote the length of that segment as \u03b8. To guarantee that all queued cars can discharge by the end of the green period, \u03b8 must satisfy: ( gL C - \u03b8 ) Q + \u03b8 Q B \u2a7e qL C ,i . e . , (A.1) \u03b8 \u2a7d gQ - q Q - Q B L C = \u03c4 1 . Eq. (A.1) implies that \u03c4 1 is the maximum portion of the green period that can be blocked by a dwelling bus if no residual queue is induced. Since the blocking segment starts to the left of U 1 V 1, \u03b8 will exceed \u03c4 1 if the blocking segment is greater than \u03c4 1 (note that the duration between U 1 V 1 and the end of the green period is \u03c4 1). Hence in this case, no residual queue is left at the end of green if and only if condition (a) of Lemma 1 holds. In the other case, i.e., when the blocking segment starts to the right of U 1 V 1 (Fig. A4 ), state B will persist for at most \u03c4 1, thus (A.1) is satisfied with certainty, and no residual queue will persist at the end of the green period. Note that after the queue dissipates, the dwelling bus will no longer be an active bottleneck (recall Eq. (2) in Section 2.1). Thus the length of the blocking segment is irrelevant. This proves condition (b).\u25a1 Now we can prove Proposition 1. To prove condition (a) of Proposition 1, by condition (b) of Lemma 1, it suffices to show that the length of U 1 V 1 is d 1. From Fig. 4 in Section 2.2, we have: U 1 V 1 \u00af = ( gL C - \u03c4 1 ) w = q - gQ B Q - Q B wL C = d 1 . When d < d 1, and if the bus arrives to the left of U 1 V 1, then condition (b) of Proposition 1 immediately follows from condition (a) of Lemma 1. If the bus arrives to the right of U 1 V 1, its dwell time can contain at most two blocking segments; as explained below. The first blocking segment, LM \u00af in Fig. A5 , satisfies condition (b) of Lemma 1, and thus will not induce any residual queue. In the mean time, the second blocking segment, PR \u00af , has to satisfy condition (a) of Lemma 1. So, S = KN \u00af - KL \u00af + NP \u00af + PR \u00af \u2a7d L C + \u03c4 1 - t a + d w . This proves condition (c) of Proposition 1.\u25a1 Appendix B Proof of Proposition 2 in Section 2.3 We first prove the following lemma: Lemma 2. If the bus arrives between U2V2 and U1V1 (see Fig. 5 in Section 2.3), then the second-best condition is achieved if and only if S \u2a7d ( 1 - g ) L C + 2 \u03c4 1 + d w . Proof of Lemma 2 A time-space diagram of this case is shown in Fig. B1 . From this figure, it can be seen that the portion of green periods during which cars can only discharge at QB , denoted as \u03b8 1 + \u03b8 2, should be no greater than 2\u03c4 1. From this we have: YZ \u00af = \u03b8 2 \u2a7d 2 \u03c4 1 - \u03b8 1 = WX \u00af . Thus, S = XY \u00af + YZ \u00af \u2a7d XY \u00af + WX \u00af = WY \u00af = L C + d w - ( gL C - 2 \u03c4 1 ) = ( 1 - g ) L C + 2 \u03c4 1 + d w . \u25a1 Now we prove the conditions of Proposition 2 one by one. For condition (a), we first verify that d 2 \u2261 U 2 V 2 \u00af : U 2 V 2 \u00af = ( gL C - 2 \u03c4 1 ) w = 2 q - g ( Q + Q B ) Q - Q B wL C = d 2 . We examine three cases: Case I: the bus arrives between U 2 V 2 and U 1 V 1, and d \u2a7e d 2. Since we assume S \u2a7d LC , we have S \u2a7d L C = ( 1 - g ) L C + 2 \u03c4 1 + d 2 w \u2a7d ( 1 - g ) L C + 2 \u03c4 1 + d w . So from Lemma 2, we know that the second-best condition can be achieved. Case II: the bus arrives to the right of U 1 V 1, and d \u2a7e d 1. This case satisfies the first-best conditions (see condition (a) of Proposition 1) and is therefore trivial. Case III: the bus arrives to the right of U 1 V 1, and d 2 \u2a7d d \u2a7d d 1. The bus dwell time in this case can contain at most two blocking segments (see the definition of \u201cblocking segments\u201d in Appendix A). Due to condition (b) of Lemma 1 (also given in Appendix A), the first blocking segment will not induce any residual queue at the end of the green period. The second blocking segment itself can be seen as a (shortened) dwell time which starts between the counterparts of U 2 V 2 and U 1 V 1 in the next cycle (see Fig. B2 ). Hence, it follows from Case I above that the residual queue induced by the second blocking segment will never persist for more than two signal cycles. This completes the proof of condition (a). Condition (b) of Proposition 2 becomes obvious by noting that 2\u03c4 1 is the maximum portion of two consecutive green periods that can be blocked by a dwelling bus, should no residual queue be present at the end of the second green period. Condition (c) immediately follows from Lemma 2. For condition (d), since the bus arrives to the right of U 1 V 1, the first blocking segment will not cause any residual queue. Thus by condition (b) of Proposition 2, the second-best conditions can be achieved in this case if the second blocking segment is no greater than 2 \u03c4 1 (see Fig. B3 ). Hence, S = KN \u00af - KL \u00af + NP \u00af + PR \u00af \u2a7d L C + 2 \u03c4 1 - t a + d w . \u25a1 References Daganzo, 1994 C.F.
