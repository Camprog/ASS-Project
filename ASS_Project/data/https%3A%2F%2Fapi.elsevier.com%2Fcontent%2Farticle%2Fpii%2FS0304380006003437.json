Abstract The movement of organisms is usually leptokurtic in which some individuals move long distances while the majority remains at or near the area they are released. There has been extensive research into the origin of such leptokurtic movement, but one important aspect that has been overlooked is that the foraging behaviour of most organisms is not Brownian as assumed in most existing models. In this paper we show that such non-Brownian foraging indeed gives rise to leptokurtic distribution. We first present a general random walk model to describe the organism movement by breaking the foraging of each individual into events of active movement and inactive stationary period; its foraging behaviour is therefore fully characterized by a joint probability of how far the individual can move in each active movement and the duration it remains stationary between two consecutive movements. The spatio-temporal distribution of the organism can be described by a generalized partial differential equation, and the leptokurtic distribution is a special case when the stationary period is not exponentially distributed. Empirical observations of some organisms living in different habitats indicated that their rest time shows a power-law distribution, and we speculate that this is general for other organisms. This leads to a fractional diffusion equation with three parameters to characterize the distributions of stationary period and movement distance. A method to estimate the parameters from empirical data is given, and we apply the model to simulate the movement of two organisms living in different habitats: a stream fish (Cyprinidae: Nocomis leptocephalus) in water, and a root-feeding weevil, Sitona lepidus in the soil. Comparison of the simulations with the measured data shows close agreement. This has an important implication in ecology that the leptokurtic distribution observed at population level does not necessarily mean population heterogeneity as most existing models suggested, in which the population consists of different phenotypes; instead, a homogeneous population moving in homogeneous habitat can also lead to leptokurtic distribution. Keywords Leptokurtic distribution Random walk model Fractional diffusion equation 1 Introduction The spatial spread of organisms is a key element underpinning ecosystem patterns and many ecological processes as diverse as plant dispersal to mate selection in animals. Understanding and subsequently modelling such spread has been an active area in both empirical and theoretical ecology for many years (Skellam, 1951; Skalski and Gilliam, 2003; Yamamura, 2002). Classical models often assume that the movement of organisms is a Brownian random walk (Turchin, 1998; Okubo and Levin, 2002; Skellam, 1951), but experimental observations over the past two decades have increasingly shown otherwise (Hastings et al., 2005). For example, there has been mounting evidence that the organism movement appears to be L\u00e9vy motion rather than Brownian walk (Viswanathan et al., 1996; Bartumeus et al., 2003; Ramos-Fernandez et al., 2004; Fritz et al., 2003; Newlands et al., 2004; Uttieri et al., 2005). Viswanathan et al. (1999) further demonstrate that the L\u00e9vy motion is a more efficient foraging strategy than Brownian walk when resources are spatially scarce and that this is consistent with experimental observations. Experimental observations of the spatial spread of organisms living in a variety of habitats show that a common feature departing from Gaussian distribution predicted by the Brownian motion is leptokurtic distribution in which the probability of individuals moving long and short distances is higher (Kot et al., 1996; Nathan, 2001). An understanding of the origin of such leptokurtosis has been an interest over the last few years. The existing explanations of this leptokurtosis vary, but most of them assume that the foraging behaviour of each individual is Brownian (Shigesada et al., 1995) and the leptokurtic movement is caused by various heterogeneities. For example, in analysing the movement of stream fish in a river, Skalski and Gilliam (2000) and Fraser et al. (2001) hypothesize that the leptokurtic spread of the fish is due to population heterogeneity in which the population consists of several groups, each group moving with different Brownian random walks. In contrast, Turchin and Thoeny (1993) attributed the leptokurtic distribution to spatial heterogeneity in which the organism moves fast in some regions and slow in others, but the movement of each individual is still Brownian random walks; such leptokurtic movement can be modelled by the diffusion equation with a spatially variable diffusion coefficient. The presence of habitat boundaries is another factor that could give rise to leptokurtic movement, as the organism changes foraging strategy when moving from one habitat to another (Morales et al., 2004). Another important mechanism that could lead to leptokurtic spread, but has been ignored, is that most organisms do not move like a Brownian walk because such foraging strategy, as outlined above, is less efficient when substrates are spatially scarce (Viswanathan et al., 1999). How to link individual-level foraging behaviour to population-level distribution remains an area to be explored, and one purpose of this paper is to establish the consequent impact of individual movement on the spatial distribution of a population. In this paper we present a general model to describe the organism movement by breaking the foraging of each individual into two events: active movement and inactive stationary period, each being treated as a random variable. The spatio-temporal distribution of the organism can be described by a generalized partial differential equation, and the Brownian movement is a special case of it when the stationary period is exponentially distributed and the movement distance distribution is Gaussian. Experimental measurements of the stationary-period distribution are rare, but study on the movement of spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) in the forest of Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico shows that the monkeys rest and the rest-time distribution follows a power law (Ramos-Fernandez et al., 2004). The power-law rest-time distribution was also found by Viswanathan et al. (1996) in their study of the movement of albatrosses in the south Atlantic. Given the contrasting habitats of the two organisms, it is reasonable to speculate that the power-law stationary-period distribution could be common, at least to some limits, for organisms living in other habitats where the resources are spatially scarce. It is proven that with a power-law stationary-period distribution, the organism movement can be described by a fractional partial differential equation with three parameters to characterize the stationary-period and movement-distance distributions. A method to estimate the three parameters based on empirical data is given, and we then apply the model to simulate the movement of a stream fish in a river reported in Skalski and Gilliam (2000), and the burrowing movement of a root-feeding weevil, Sitona lepidus Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) towards its host plant roots in soil. In reality, the stationary period and movement distance of all organisms have finite mean and variance. In other words, given enough time, the spatial distribution of the organisms will eventually change to Gaussian as many experiments had revealed. The important question in ecology is when and where such a transition occurs. We briefly address this in discussion section and present a method to modify the proposed model so that it can naturally describe the transition from leptokurtic distribution to Gaussian distribution. 2 Theoretical analysis We break the foraging behaviour of each individual into active movement and inactive stationary period as illustrated in Fig. 1 , each event being treated as a random variable. The term of stationary period used here is general, representing that the organism stops moving due to any reasons and under any circumstances. This includes rest, trapped by physical barriers and sticking at habitat boundaries. The moving behaviour of the individual can be fully characterized by a joint probability of the distance that the individual moves in each active movement and the duration that the organism remains stationary between two consecutive movements as shown in Fig. 1. For simplicity of analysis we assume that the organism movement is in one dimension, but extending to multiple dimensions is straightforward. The distribution function of the joint probability is denoted by \u03c8(x, t), where x is the moving distance and t is the duration of the stationary period. From the definition of \u03c8(x, t), it is known that the probability distribution of the movement distance is: (1) \u03bb ( x ) = \u222b 0 \u221e \u03c8 ( x , t ) d t , and the distribution of the stationary period is: (2) w ( t ) = \u222b \u2212 \u221e \u221e \u03c8 ( x , t ) d x . The probability that the individual just arrives at position x at time t is denoted by \u03b7(x, t). The relation between \u03c8(x, t) and \u03b7(x, t) is therefore given by (Metzler and Klafter, 2000): (3) \u03b7 ( x , t ) = \u222b \u2212 \u221e \u221e \u222b 0 t \u03c8 ( x \u2212 x \u2032 , t \u2212 t \u2032 ) \u03b7 ( x \u2032 , t \u2032 ) d t \u2032 d x \u2032 + \u03b4 ( x ) \u03b4 ( t ) , where \u03b4() is the Dirac delta function. The second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (3) represents the initial condition. We denote the probability that the individual is at position x at time t by p(x, t). To determine p(x, t), it needs to include the probability that the individual arrives at x earlier than t and then remains stationary there at least until t; this gives (Scher and Lax, 1973), (4) p ( x , t ) = \u222b 0 t \u03b7 ( x , t \u2032 ) \u03d5 ( t \u2212 t \u2032 ) d t \u2032 , where (5) \u03d5 ( t ) = 1 \u2212 \u222b 0 t w ( t \u2032 ) d t \u2032 . Applying the Laplace (to time) and Fourier (to space) transforms to Eqs. (3)\u2013(5) and then rearranging terms give: (6) p * \u00af ( \u03c9 , s ) = 1 \u2212 w \u00af ( s ) s 1 1 \u2212 \u03c8 \u00af * ( \u03c9 , s ) , where the overbar and the asterisk represent the Laplace and Fourier transforms, respectively, and \u03c9 and s are the Fourier and Laplace transform variables, respectively. In this paper we assume that the stationary period is independent of the movement distance although validation of this assumption needs further experiments. The joint probability can therefore be decoupled to \u03c8 \u00af * ( \u03c9 , s ) = \u03bb * ( \u03c9 ) w \u00af ( s ) , and Eq. (6) hence reduces to: (7) p * \u00af ( \u03c9 , s ) = 1 \u2212 w \u00af ( s ) s 1 1 \u2212 \u03bb * ( \u03c9 ) w \u00af ( s ) . Rearranging terms gives: (8) s p * \u00af ( \u03c9 , s ) \u2212 1 = s w \u00af ( s ) 1 \u2212 w \u00af ( s ) [ \u03bb * ( \u03c9 ) \u2212 1 ] p * \u00af ( \u03c9 , s ) . Eqs. (7) and (8) are the general random walk model to describe the movement of the individual over space and time. The classical diffusion model derived as a continuum of the Brownian random walk can be seen as a special asymptotic case of Eq. (8) when the stationary-period distribution is exponential and the movement-distance distribution is Gaussian. In this case, the two terms in Eq. (8) are w \u00af ( s ) = ( 1 + a s ) \u2212 1 and \u03bb*(\u03c9)=exp(i\u03c9u \u2212 \u03c3 2 \u03c9), where a, u and \u03c3 2 are parameters. In the limit, \u03bb*(\u03c9)\u22481+ i\u03c9u \u2212 \u03c3 2 \u03c9, and substituting these into Eq. (8) and then transforming \u03c9\u2013s domain back to x\u2013t domain yields the classical diffusion equation. The so-called \u2018fat-tail\u2019 model of Kot et al. (1996) is also a special case of Eq. (8) when the movement distance has a stable power-law distribution whose Fourier transform is defined by (Nolan, 2007): (9) \u03bb * ( \u03c9 ) = exp \u2061 { i \u03c9 u \u2212 D | \u03c9 | \u03b1 [ 1 \u2212 i K sgn ( \u03c9 ) z \u03b1 ( \u03c9 ) ] } , z \u03b1 \u03c9 = tan \u2061 \u03c0 \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 \u2260 1 , \u2212 2 \u03c0 ln \u03c9 , \u03b1 = 1. where D, \u03b1 and K are parameters. A special case of Eq. (9) is the L\u00e9vy flight when 1< \u03b1 \u22642. In this case, Eq. (9) is simplified as follows: (10) \u03bb * ( \u03c9 ) = exp \u2061 { i \u03c9 u \u2212 D [ p ( i \u03c9 ) \u03b1 + q ( \u2212 i \u03c9 ) \u03b1 ] } with p + q =1, which has been found to be the foraging strategy of many organisms ranging from albatrosses (Viswanathan et al., 1996) to tuna fish (Newlands et al., 2004). For the L\u00e9vy flight expressed by Eq. (10), we can derive the following equation by transforming Eq. (8) in the s\u2013\u03c9 domain back to the s\u2013x domain as follows: (11) s p * \u00af \u03c9 , s \u2212 1 = s w \u00af ( s ) 1 \u2212 w \u00af ( s ) p D \u2202 \u03b1 p \u00af \u2202 x \u03b1 + q D \u2202 \u03b1 p \u00af \u2202 ( \u2212 x ) \u03b1 \u2212 u \u2202 p \u00af \u2202 x . where the fractional derivatives are given in Zhang et al. (2005). However, the organisms studied in this work did not make extreme long jumps, and we therefore assume that the movement distance can be approximated as a Gaussian distribution in which \u03b1 =2. 2.1 Model for leptokurtic movement Experimental data about the distribution of stationary period is rare because continuously tracking the movement of a large number of organisms is difficult in field studies. However, there have been a few experiments which revealed that the stationary period is not exponential but follows a power law (Viswanathan et al., 1996; Ramos-Fernandez et al., 2004). For example, Ramos-Fernandez et al. (2004) find that the rest-time distribution of a spider monkey (A. geoffroyi) in the forest of Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico is well described by a power-law function of w ( t ) = A ( \u03c4 / t ) 1 + \u03b1 with the exponent \u03b1 =0.7, where A and \u03c4 are constant parameters. If this is a general pattern for other organisms, let us examine its consequent impact on their spatio-temporal distribution. The Laplace transform of the power-law stationary-period distribution for \u03b1 \u22641 is: (12) w ( s ) \u2248 1 1 + a s \u03b1 , where a is a parameter. Substituting Eq. (12) into Eq. (11) gives: (13) a s \u03b1 p * \u00af ( \u03c9 , s ) \u2212 s \u03b1 \u2212 1 = D \u2202 2 p \u00af \u2202 x 2 \u2212 u \u2202 p \u00af \u2202 x . Transforming Eq. (13) back to the x\u2013t domain gives: (14) \u2202 \u03b1 p ( x , t ) \u2202 t \u03b1 = D a \u2202 p 2 ( x , t ) \u2202 x 2 \u2212 u a \u2202 p ( x , t ) \u2202 x , where the fractional derivative is defined by (Zhang et al., 2005): (15) \u2202 \u03b1 p \u2202 t \u03b1 = 1 \u0393 ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) \u222b 0 t 1 ( t \u2212 t \u2032 ) \u03b1 \u2202 p ( x , t \u2032 ) \u2202 t \u2032 d t \u2032 , where \u0393() is the gamma function. Eq. (14) is the partial differential equation model for organisms whose stationary-period distribution is a power-law function and the movement distance is approximated by a Gaussian distribution. To demonstrate the impact of the stationary-period distribution on organism movement, we simulated the movements of 1000 individuals over an infinite domain with four stationary period patterns as shown in Fig. 2a, which is fully characterized by the parameter \u03b1. The simulations were run with D/a =1.0m2 day\u2212\u03b1 for movement with and without biased shifting (u/a =0.2mday\u2212\u03b1 and u =0, respectively). The organism movement was simulated with the numerical method presented in Appendix A. The 1000 individuals were initially around x =0 and their distributions after 100 days with different stationary period patterns are shown in Fig. 2b and c for movement with and without biased shift, respectively. It is obvious that as the value of \u03b1 decreases, the spatial distribution departs from Gaussian (\u03b1 =1) to leptokurtosis, and the leptokurtosis increases as the value of \u03b1 decreases. 3 Experiments and model applications 3.1 Movement of a stream fish Skalski and Gilliam (2000) studied the movement of four fish species in a small river over a 5-month period using a mark-recapture technique. The spatial distribution of the fishes were observed on four occasions at monthly interval over 37 sites; the mean length of the sites is 10\u201315m. Detailed experimental protocols and the results are given in Skalski and Gilliam (2000). The observed spatial distributions of all the four species show various leptokurtosis over the period of 5 months. We take the bluehead chubs (Cyprinidae: Nocomis leptocephalus) as an example to be in line with the analysis of Skalski and Gilliam (2000). Skalski and Gilliam (2000) attributed the leptokurtic distribution to population heterogeneity in which some individuals move fast and others slow, and the movements of both fast and slow fishes are Brownian motions. Instead of population heterogeneity, here we show that the observed leptokurtic distribution could result from a non-Brownian motion where the population is homogeneous and the foraging behaviour of all the individuals is statistically the same. Statistical analysis shows that the movement of bluehead chubs has upstream bias for unknown reasons (Skalski and Gilliam, 2000). We hence use a constant shifting parameter u to describe the biased movement. In the modelling, we combine u/a as a single parameter denoted by U (u/a = U) and D/a as a single parameter denoted by E (D/a = E). The size of the spatial increment \u0394x in the simulations was chosen to be the same as the average site length 12.5m, i.e., \u0394x =12.5m; and the size of the time step is chosen to ensure that all the coefficients defined in Eq. (A.4) are positive. 3.1.1 Parameter determination The parameter \u03b1, which measures the stationary-period distribution, and U, which represents biased movement, are estimated from the observed data based on that the average moving distance X(t) after a time period of t, i.e., the first moment of the probability p in Eq. (8), is given by (Metzler and Klafter, 2000): (16) X ( t ) = \u222b \u2212 \u221e \u221e x p ( x , t ) d x = U t \u03b1 \u0393 ( 1 + \u03b1 ) . We estimated the first moment X(t) using all the data taken within the 5-month period and then fitted the result to the power-law function given in Eq. (16), yielding X(t)\u22480.41t 0.44. Comparing this to the right-hand side of Eq. (16) gives \u03b1 =0.44 and U =0.35mday\u22120.44. There is no independent way to estimate E, and we therefore estimated it by minimizing the absolute difference between the solutions obtained from Eq. (A.4) and the measurements taken after 2 months. The final result is E =1.2m2 day\u22120.44. Fig. 3b compares the observations and the results calculated using Eq. (A.4) with the independently estimated \u03b1 =0.44, U =0.35mday\u22120.44 and the calibrated E =1.2m2 day\u22120.44; the determinant coefficient is R 2 =0.92. 3.1.2 Predicting the spatial spread We predicted the spatial distributions observed after one month, three months and four months, using Eq. (A.4) and the independently estimated parameters \u03b1 =0.44, U =0.35mday\u22120.44 and E =1.2m2 day\u22120.44. As the total number of the recaptured fish varied from occasion to occasion, we scaled the simulated results in such a way that the total number of the fish recovered from the simulation is the same as that recaptured in each occasion. The comparison between the simulations and the observations is shown in Fig. 3a, d and c for the three occasions, where the size of the spatial increment \u0394x was again chosen to be the same as the average site length 12.5m. Overall, the predictions and the observations agree well with the determinant coefficients higher than 0.89. We also simulated the spatial spread with the diffusion model (Chong et al., 2005) and the population heterogeneous diffusion model (PHED) as used in Skalski and Gilliam (2000). In the former, the population is homogeneous and the movement of all the individuals is statistically the same; whilst in the latter the population consists of two groups, one group moves fast and the other moves slowly. All the parameters were taken from Skalski and Gilliam (2000). The simulations using the diffusion model (PHOD), PHED model, together with the proposed fractional model (FM) and the observations are compared in Fig. 3a, c and d. Overall, PHED and FM agree well with the observed spatial spreads, but the PHOD gives rise to significant errors as expected, indicating that the foraging behaviour of the individuals cannot be modelled as a single Brownian random walk. 3.2 Movement of a root-feeding weevil, S. lepidus in the soil The clover root weevil S. lepidus is a destructive pest of white clover (Trifolium repens L.), attacking the plant aboveground as adults and belowground as soil-dwelling larvae. The adults lay eggs aboveground that ultimately fall to the soil surface, giving rise to soil-dwelling larvae that attack root nodules as neonates, before feeding on progressively larger roots. The newly hatched larva has to locate its host, root nodules, in a limited amount of time to avoid dying of starvation (Gerard, 2001). This is regarded as the most vulnerable part of its life cycle. To find how the newly hatched larvae forage to find their host plant roots and the root exudates that attract the larvae, we have conducted a series of experiments (Johnson et al., 2004a, b, 2005). Using X-ray computed tomography, we found that the larvae can locate the root nodules from a distance of up to 6cm in soil (Johnson et al., 2004b), suggesting the presence of a chemical signalling between the larvae and the root system. A further study reveals that the isoflavonoids present in root nodules could provide the cue that attracts the larvae moving towards the nodules (Johnson et al., 2005). Here we apply the model to simulate the larval movement in a Y-tube system that we designed to investigate the relative attractiveness of different clovers to the newly hatched larvae. Detailed descriptions of the experiment are given in Johnson et al. (2004b), but a brief summary is presented here for clarification. The experiments were conducted in soil-filled Y-tubes as shown in Fig. 4 , each of the two arms consisting of a series of plastic tubes sealed together using waterproof tape. Different plants were grown on the terminal sections of the tubes behind a fine gauze wall used to prevent the roots growing into the tubes. The Y-tubes were buried in a tray of acid washed sand with only the aerial parts of the plants above ground. It was then kept in a glasshouse for further 10 days before 5 newly hatched larvae were placed into the hole at the arm junction as shown in Fig. 4. Once the larvae were inside, the hole was immediately sealed. Three days after the larvae were introduced, the Y-tubes were dismantled to ascertain the final location of the larvae. Several choice tests, each consisting of 12 replicas, were conducted in an attempt to investigate which plant is more attractive to the larvae. The study demonstrated that the larvae are preferentially attracted to T. repens (for complete details see Johnson et al., 2004b). We therefore only consider two choice tests: T. repens roots with nodules in one arm and soil in the other, and T. repens roots without nodules in one arm and soil in the other. The average percentage of the larvae recovered at each section of the Y-tubes is shown in Fig. 5 for the two choice tests. Our previous work shows that the larvae are attracted to clover roots/nodules via a chemotaxis (Johnson et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006), resulting in a biased movement. Herein, we used a biased shifting parameter to describe such chemotaxis. Since the measurements were taken one occasion only, it is impossible to independently estimate the three parameters using the method outlined above. We therefore used a calibration to estimate the three parameters. The values of the three parameters were obtained by maximizing the determinant coefficient between the simulations and the measurements. The calibration started from a \u2018trial-error\u2019 by comparing the simulations and the data until a satisfactory agreement, judged by eye, was reached. The optimal values of the parameters were then calculated through local search in the vicinity of the parameters estimated by the \u2018trial-error\u2019. The comparison between the simulations and the observations is shown in Fig. 5a and b, and the calibrated parameters are \u03b1 =0.83, E = D/a =2.5mm2 h\u22120.83, U =0.28mmh\u22120.83 for the choice test of roots with nodules; and \u03b1 =0.80, E = D/a =1.6mm2 h\u22120.80, U =0.11mmh\u22120.80 for the choice test of roots without nodules. The results indicate that the diffusion coefficient and biased shifting parameter for the choice test of roots with nodules are bigger than for the choice test of roots without nodules, suggesting that in the presence of nodules the larvae are more active and forage faster than when root nodules are absent. This is consistent with our finding from open arenas that in the vicinity of their hosts, the larvae become more active, giving rise to a bigger diffusion coefficient (Johnson et al., 2006a). Another interesting point is the order of the fractional derivative, which is smaller for the choice test of roots without nodules (0.80) than for the choice test of roots with nodules (0.83). As the order of the fractional derivative determines the stationary-period distribution, from its impact on the pattern of stationary-period distribution shown in Fig. 2, it can be interpreted that the larvae were likely to have remained stationary more frequently when foraging in the absence of nodules than foraging in the presence of nodules. We also simulated the larval movement in the two choice tests using the diffusion model (Yamamura et al., 2003; Chong et al., 2005), and the results are shown in Fig. 5 in comparison with the experimental data and the proposed model. Both models match the data well even though the proposed model is marginally better than the diffusion model. There are two reasons behind the closeness between the two models. The first is that the larval movement was close to Brownian motion that can be described reasonably well by the diffusion equation. The second is that we sampled the larvae in the five sections as shown in Fig. 4, yielding only five data points for each choice test, which could be insufficient to detect leptokurtic distribution. Sampling intensively can identify the spatial distribution better, but tracking soil-dwelling insects is extremely difficult because soil is opaque. In fact, the experimental data presented here is one of few available to quantify the responsive movement and spatial distribution of soil insects towards to their hosts in soils. 4 Summary and discussion The leptokurtic movement distribution is a common feature of spatial spread of many organisms and the explanation of its origin varies. Although the leptokurtosis could be a result of a combination of many mechanisms, one aspect that has been ignored in ecological modelling is that most organisms do not forage like a Brownian random walk as most models have assumed. In this paper we address this and show that such a non-Brownian movement could indeed lead to the leptokurtic distribution. We started by presenting a general random walk model to describe the foraging behaviour of the organism by breaking the movement of each individual into active movement and inactive stationary period. The foraging behaviour of the individual is fully determined by a joint probability to characterize the distributions of the stationary period and movement distance. The classical diffusion model is a special case when the stationary-period distribution is exponential and the movement-distance distribution is Gaussian. The \u2018fat-tail\u2019 model of Kot et al. (1996) is also a special case when the movement distance has a stable-law distribution (Nolan, 2007). Based on the observed rest-time distribution of organisms living in different habitats, we propose that the organisms undertake long stationary periods and the probability distribution of these stationary periods follows a power law. This results in a fractional partial differential equation, naturally yielding the leptokurtic distribution for organism movement. Overall, the proposed model needs three parameters to characterize the stationary-period and movement-distance distributions. The derived partial differential equation is difficult to solve analytically because of the involvement of a fractional derivative; a numerical method is therefore developed. We present a method to estimate the three parameters based on experimental observations and apply the model to simulate the movement of bluehead chubs (Cyprinidae: N. leptocephalus) in a small river reported in Skalski and Gilliam (2000), and the burrowing movement of root-feeding weevil, S. lepidus in soil. The simulated results agree well with the observations. For the bluehead chubs, the parameters independently estimated from measurement at one occasion predicted the observations taken at other three occasions well, indicating that, in terms of movement, the population is homogenous and the foraging strategy of the fishes did not change over the five-month period. Whilst for the root-feeding weevil, S. lepidus, it is found that the larvae move faster with a fewer long resting periods when moving towards roots with nodules than towards roots without nodules. It needs to emphasize that other approaches such as the population heterogeneity model and diffusion model with a spatially variable diffusion coefficient also fit the observations well, but this does not rule out the non-Brownian movement. What is important in ecology is to understand the origin of the leptokurtosis rather than simply to best fit the measured data using a mathematical model because ecological modelling should aim to explain the biological mechanisms behind the spatial patterns observed at population level. In particular, it is important to establish the dependence of the spatial pattern at population level on individual-level foraging behaviour (Skalski and Gilliam, 2000; Holker and Breckling, 2005). In this respect, the proposed model differs from the existing models in that we address the link between population-level distribution and the individual foraging behaviour. The ability of the proposed model for predicting the movement of the two organisms in different habitats gives another mechanism that could lead to leptokurtic distribution of organism movement. This has important implications in ecology. The most important one is probably the interpretation of the phenotypes and foraging behaviour of individuals based on the distribution pattern observed at population level. If the movement of each individual in a population is Brownian walks as assumed in most existing models, the leptokurtic distribution can only be explained by assuming a phenotypically heterogeneous population (Yamamura, 2002) in which individuals are phenotypically different, and the transition from leptokurtosis to Gaussian is due to the change of individuals from one phenotype to another. Although such heterogeneity and phenotype change may exist in ecological systems, this paper gives another biological mechanism that could lead to the leptokurtic distribution observed at population level. In particular, it shows that a homogeneous population, in which the foraging behaviour of all the individuals is statistically the same, could also give rise to leptokurtic distribution at population level even in a spatially homogeneous habitat. Another finding is the impact of substrates on foraging behaviour. The analysis of the movement of the root-feeding weevil, S. lepidus in the soil indicates that the moving behaviour of the organisms in the presence of resources could be different from that in the absence of the resources. In the absence of resources, the organism appears to remain stationary more frequently than in the presence of resources. This could be important in agricultural systems because root-feeding insects cause sustained damage to crops, which are difficult to diagnose because soils are opaque (Hunter, 2001). Mathematical models can play a part in addressing this issue (Hunt et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2006). Although the proposed model appears to be more accurate than the commonly used diffusion models (Yamamura et al., 2003; Shiyomi and Tsuiki, 1999) in describing the spatial spread of the larvae, it still is premature to conclude that the foraging behaviour of the soil-dwelling insects has a power-law rest-time distribution because of the limited data; this warrants further research. The advances of new technologies such as X-ray computed tomography (Johnson et al., 2004a,b) and acoustic technology (Mankin et al., 2001) have made it feasible to continuously monitor/hear the movement of soil insects, which may help improve the modelling (Johnson et al., 2006b). This paper aims to draw the attention of ecologists not to overlook the non-Brownian motion in analysing the leptokurtic distributions of organism movement. An inappropriate use of model for the population-level distribution could lead to wrong interpretations of phenotypes and foraging behaviour of the individuals, and the biological aspects behind their spatial distribution. The term of stationary period used in this paper is general and depends on scales. It does not necessarily mean that the organism stays motionless at a spatial point. It represents the duration in which the organism stays in a specific area or a habitat. The size of the area/habitat depends on the ecological questions, the spatial and temporal scales that the samples are taken. For example, in the movement of the stream fish the average size of the sites was 12.5m, and as long as the fish remains in the same site, it is interpreted as being stationary. The power-law stationary-period distribution used in this paper gives rise to a persistent leptokurtic movement distribution. In reality, the movement distance and stationary period of all organisms have finite mean and variance, meaning that given enough time, the spatial distribution of the organism will ultimately converge to Gaussian due to the central limit theorem. For example, in the stream fish experiment, the number of the species that changes from leptokurtosis to Gaussian after one month and two months is 1 and 2, respectively, and only one species continues to show leptokurtosis after four months. What is important in ecology is when and where the transition from leptokurtosis to Gaussian occurs. Obviously, this varies with organism taxa, and from habitat to habitat. The ability to model such transition is important in ecology but is rarely addressed. In the population heterogeneity model, such transition is modelled by allowing the individuals to change from one phenotype to another, and eventually the population becomes homogeneous (Skalski and Gilliam, 2000). Such approach describes the transition, but whether it is phenotypically true requires experimental test. In the proposed model, we can model such transition using a modified power-law stationary-period distribution. For example, we can use the following stationary-period distribution to describe the stationary periods \u03c8(t)= A exp(\u2212t/t 2)(1+ at)\u22121\u2212\u03b1 , where t 2 is a threshold to control when the transition from leptokurtosis to Gaussian distribution takes place, and A ={a \u22121 \u03c4 \u03b1 exp(\u03c4 \u22121)\u0393(\u03b1,\u03c4 \u22121)} in which \u03c4 2 = at 2 (Cortis and Berkowitz, 2004; Dentz et al., 2004). An example illustrating the role of t 2 in dictating the transition from leptokurtic distribution to Gaussian is shown in Fig. 6 , from which we can see that the transition takes place later with the increase of the value of t 2. Equally, we can apply a similar threshold to truncate the \u2018fat-tail\u2019 model of Kot et al. (1996) in that beyond a certain range, the movement-distance distribution drops from a power law to \u03bb(x)\u221dexp(\u2212ax 2) to ensure that the movement distance is Gaussian-bounded. These improvements will undoubtedly improve our ability to model and understand the movement of a wide range of organisms, but are left for further investigation, which will benefit from further empirical data of the spatial spread of organisms in a variety of environments.

(14) describes the probability of finding an individual at position x at time t. If there are M individuals, multiplying M to both sides of Eq. (14) gives: (A.1) \u2202 \u03b1 n ( x , t ) \u2202 t \u03b1 = D a \u2202 n 2 ( x , t ) \u2202 x 2 \u2212 u a \u2202 n ( x , t ) \u2202 x , where n = Mp is the number of individuals at position x at time t. If the number of individuals is sufficiently large to allow n to be approximated as a continuous variable over space, we can directly solve Eq. (A.1) to get the organism distribution over space and time. Here we solve Eq. (A.1) numerically by a finite difference method, as analytical solution of Eq. (A.1) is difficult to derive. The two spatial derivatives in Eq. (A.1) are approximated by the standard finite difference method as follows: (A.2) D a \u2202 n 2 ( x , t ) \u2202 x 2 \u2248 D a n i \u2212 1 \u2212 2 n i + n i + 1 \u0394 x 2 , u a \u2202 n ( x , t ) \u2202 x \u2248 u a n i + 1 \u2212 n i \u2212 1 2 \u0394 x , where the subscripts i and i \u00b11 represent locations x i and x i\u00b11, respectively, and \u0394x is the size of the spatial increment, or the minimal size of the area where the sample is taken. The fractional temporal derivative is approximated based on its definition by (Zhang et al., 2005): (A.3) \u2202 \u03b1 n \u2202 t \u03b1 = 1 \u0393 ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) \u222b 0 t k n \u2032 ( x i , t k \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u03c4 \u03b1 d \u03c4 \u2248 1 \u0393 ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) \u0394 t \u222b 0 t k n ( x i , t k + 1 / 2 \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u2212 n ( x i , t k + 1 / 2 \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u03c4 \u03b1 d \u03c4 \u2248 1 \u0393 ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) \u0394 t \u2211 j = 0 k \u222b j \u0394 t ( j + 1 ) \u0394 t n ( x i , t k + 1 / 2 \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u2212 n ( x i , t k \u2212 1 / 2 \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u03c4 \u03b1 d \u03c4 = 1 \u0394 t \u03b1 \u2211 j = 1 k c j ( n i k + 1 \u2212 j \u2212 n i k \u2212 j ) , where \u0394t is the time step, n i k \u2212 j represents the number of individuals at position x i at time t k \u2212 j\u0394t, and the coefficient c j =[(j +1)1\u2212\u03b1 \u2212 j 1\u2212\u03b1 ]/\u0393(2\u2212 \u03b1). Combining Eqs. (A.2) and (A.3) gives: (A.4) n i k + 1 = P 1 n i k + \u2211 j = 1 k \u2212 1 P j + 1 n i k \u2212 j + c k c 0 n i 0 + P i - 1 n i \u2212 1 k + P i + 1 n i + 1 k . where (A.5) P 1 = c 0 \u2212 c 1 c 0 \u2212 2 D \u0394 t \u03b1 a c 0 \u0394 x 2 , P j + 1 = c j \u2212 c j + 1 c 0 , j > 0 P i \u2212 1 = D \u0394 t \u03b1 a c 0 \u0394 x 2 + u \u0394 t \u03b1 2 c 0 \u0394 x , P i + 1 = D \u0394 t \u03b1 a c 0 \u0394 x 2 + u \u0394 t \u03b1 2 c 0 \u0394 x . If the number of the individuals is insufficient to allow n being treated as a continuous variable over space, we need an individual-based model to track the movement of each individual. Such an individual-based model can be easily developed based on Eq. (A.4) with the method used by Zhang et al. (2006). In fact, the coefficients in Eq. (A.5) represent the probabilities of an individual moving from one position to another. For example, the coefficient P i\u22121 represents the probability of an individual moving from position x i\u22121 to position x i within the time period of \u0394t, and the coefficient P j is the probability that an individual, which is at position x i at time t \u2212(j \u22121)\u0394t, continues to remain at position x i at time t +\u0394t. However, developing such individual-based model is beyond the scope of this paper as in the examples we studied, n can be assumed to be a continuous variable over space.

There has been extensive research into the origin of such leptokurtic movement, but one important aspect that has been overlooked is that the foraging behaviour of most organisms is not Brownian as assumed in most existing models. In this paper we show that such non-Brownian foraging indeed gives rise to leptokurtic distribution. We first present a general random walk model to describe the organism movement by breaking the foraging of each individual into events of active movement and inactive stationary period; its foraging behaviour is therefore fully characterized by a joint probability of how far the individual can move in each active movement and the duration it remains stationary between two consecutive movements. The spatio-temporal distribution of the organism can be described by a generalized partial differential equation, and the leptokurtic distribution is a special case when the stationary period is not exponentially distributed. Empirical observations of some organisms living in different habitats indicated that their rest time shows a power-law distribution, and we speculate that this is general for other organisms. This leads to a fractional diffusion equation with three parameters to characterize the distributions of stationary period and movement distance. A method to estimate the parameters from empirical data is given, and we apply the model to simulate the movement of two organisms living in different habitats: a stream fish (Cyprinidae: Nocomis leptocephalus) in water, and a root-feeding weevil, Sitona lepidus in the soil. Comparison of the simulations with the measured data shows close agreement. This has an important implication in ecology that the leptokurtic distribution observed at population level does not necessarily mean population heterogeneity as most existing models suggested, in which the population consists of different phenotypes; instead, a homogeneous population moving in homogeneous habitat can also lead to leptokurtic distribution.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2007-01-10", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304380006003437", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zhang, Xiaoxian"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Johnson, Scott N."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Crawford, John W."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Gregory, Peter J."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Young, Iain M."}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304380006003437"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380006003437"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0304-3800(06)00343-7", "prism:volume": "200", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier B.V.", "dc:title": "A general random walk model for the leptokurtic distribution of organism movement: Theory and application", "prism:copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.
