Abstract Taking the waste collection management as the practical background, the rollon-rolloff vehicle routing problem (RRVRP) involves tractors pulling large containers between customer locations and the disposal facility.

The objective is to find tractor routes that feature the minimum amount of total nonproductive time. In the literature the RRVRP is formulated as the node routing problem, and the \u201ctrip\u201d definition that is the complete transport service of a container is used. To relax some assumptions of the RRVRP to cater to practical desires, we present a variant called the generalized RRVRP (G-RRVRP). The G-RRVRP generalizes the practical background, the objective function and the demand flow, and considers specially container loading and unloading time constraints. The G-RRVRP classifies demand into loaded-container demand and cargo demand with time windows. On condition of respecting container loading/unloading time and customer time windows, the G-RRVRP can design tractor routes for the synchronous scheduling of loaded and empty containers so as to ensure the timeliness of transport service. The G-RRVRP aims to minimize the total running cost of used tractors, instead of the total nonproductive time of tractors adopted by the RRVRP. A mixed integer linear programming model for the G-RRVRP is proposed. The Benders decomposition algorithm involving Pareto-optimal cuts and Benders decomposition-callback implementation, and a two-stage heuristic involving the savings algorithm followed by a local search phase are provided. The mathematical formulation and the two-stage heuristic are tested by solving 40 small-scale instances and 20 benchmark instances. Small-scale instances can be solved directly by CPLEX through the Benders decomposition strategies to find exact solutions. The case study indicates the applicability of the G-RRVRP model and the two-stage heuristic to realistic-size problems abstracted from intercity linehaul systems. The computational experiments and case study indicate that the heuristic can solve various instances of the G-RRVRP such that the solution quality and the computation time are acceptable. Keywords Rollon-rolloff vehicle routing problem Generalized RRVRP Mixed integer linear programming Benders decomposition Savings algorithm 1 Introduction So far researchers have put forward several kinds of vehicle routing problems (VRPs) catering to waste collection management, one of which is the rollon-rolloff vehicle routing problem (RRVRP). The basic form of the RRVRP was presented by Bodin et al. (2000). The RRVRP involves one depot for holding tractors and one disposal facility for emptying full-containers. Each used-tractor begins and ends its route at the depot. Customer demand includes emptying a full container, ordering an empty container or replacing a full container with an empty container. Tractors pull large containers between customer locations and the disposal facility. Tractors can only move one container to serve one customer at a time (Kim et al., 2006). The objective is to find tractor routes that feature the minimum of total nonproductive time. In nonproductive time tractors run alone on arcs. The waste collection management is the practical background of the RRVRP. Formulating the RRVRP as the node routing problem, Bodin et al. (2000) presented the RRVRP on a directed complete graph G\u202f=\u202f(V, A). A is the arc set. V is the vertex set that consists of one depot, one disposal facility which is also regarded as an unlimited inventory of empty containers, and an amount of customer locations. Customer demand is classified into several types of trips served by tractors. A \u201ctrip\u201d is defined to be the complete service of a container for a customer. Four types of trips (i.e., Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, and Type 4) are defined in the RRVRP stated by Bodin et al. (2000). For the Type 1, a full container is transported by a tractor from a customer to the disposal facility for emptying, and the emptied container is returned to the customer by the same tractor. For the Type 2, an empty container is exchanged with a full container at a customer location. For the Type 3, an empty container is brought to a customer. For the Type 4, a full container from a customer is transferred to the disposal facility. The service time of a trip includes container loading/unloading time and traveling time. The loaded container leg and the empty container leg are integrated in the first or the second type of trips. In the literature several variants of the RRVRP have been proposed, which are characterized by the involved service types, time windows, etc. De Meulemeester et al. (1997) solved a variant associated with the collection and delivery of skips. A tractor can carry only one skip at a time. In one skip a tractor departing from a depot transports a full container from a customer location to a disposal site. Bodin et al. (2000) solved the RRVRP through several heuristics, and twenty benchmark instances ranging from 50 to 199 trips and belonging to four classes (i.e., class A, B, C, or D) were used. In each class there are five test problems. The four classes differ in the mix of Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, and Type 4 trips. The number of trips in the five test problems in each class is 50, 75, 100, 150, and 199 trips, respectively. The class A problems have a preponderance of Type 1 trips, the class B problems have about the same number of Type 1 and Type 2 trips, and the class C problems have a preponderance of Type 2 trips. All class A, class B, and class C problems have only a few Type 3 and Type 4 trips. The class D problems have about the same number of Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, and Type 4 trips. Derigs et al. (2013) combined local search and large neighborhood search to solve the twenty benchmark instances provided by Bodin et al. (2000). Wy and Kim (2013) adopted a large neighborhood search and various improvement methods to solve the RRVRP. New best-known solutions are found for seventeen instances out of the twenty benchmark instances of Bodin et al. (2000). Baldacci et al. (2006) proposed the multiple disposal facilities and multiple inventory locations RRVRP (M-RRVRP). Five types of trips are considered. A bounding procedure combining three lower bounds derived from different relaxations of the M-RRVRP formulation is provided. Wy et al. (2013) presented the RRVRP with time windows (RRVRPTW) considering multiple disposal facilities and multiple inventory locations. Hauge et al. (2014) addressed another type of the RRVRP in which four types of trips, multiple depots, multiple disposal facilities and various container types are considered. Despite the widely practical application of waste collection problems, many important realistic features are often ignored in the literature (Markov et al., 2016). Both practitioners and researchers are striving to find more suitable ways to tackle various practical situations, since the situations that waste collection enterprises may face vary. Most of the optimization techniques used for tactical and operational situations derive from methods for the RRVRP and some variants (e.g., the RRVRPTW). To make some assumptions of the RRVRP to be more practical and to generalize the situation of the RRVRP, we present in the paper a new variant called the generalized rollon-rolloff vehicle routing problem (G-RRVRP). Compared with the RRVRP, the G-RRVRP generalizes the practical background, the objective function and the demand flow, and considers specially container loading and unloading time constraints. On condition of respecting container loading/unloading time and customer time windows, the G-RRVRP provides tractor routes for the synchronous scheduling of loaded and empty containers so as to ensure the timeliness of transport service. The G-RRVRP is based on the RRVRP defined by Bodin et al. (2000). The G-RRVRP caters to practical issues and is more general and complicated than the RRVRP models discussed in previous literature. The motivation for generalizing the RRVRP to the G-RRVRP is as follows. (i) As shown by the computational results in Pradenas et al. (2013), the types of vehicles and the use rates of vehicles are of importance to the total cost of vehicle routes. Considering the constitution modes of the autonomous and non-autonomous parts, truck vehicles can be classified into two types (Drexl, 2013): single-unit trucks and combination trucks. The tractor-container combination is one type of combination trucks. The RRVRP employs the tractor-container combination for waste collection management. The tractor-container combination allows increased use rate of the tractor. Both the waste collection management and the intercity linehaul system are the practical backgrounds of the G-RRVRP. The tractor cannot directly load cargoes, and is only used for pulling containers. In practice a tractor can travel with a loaded-container, travel with an empty container, or travel alone. The combinations with various configurations travelling on arcs consume different running costs. Instead of optimizing the total nonproductive time for tractor running alone, minimizing the total running cost of used tractors is more meaningful for practitioners. (ii) In the RRVRP presented by Bodin et al. (2000), one disposal facility is located on the network, which resembles a many-to-one problem from the angle of loaded-container flow. The loaded-container flow exists between customers and the disposal facility. In case of the situation stated by Wy et al. (2013), the demand of a customer may not be satisfied in a given day because the service starting time is too late to visit a disposal facility. In that case, the full container is kept at the depot at the end of the day, and it is transferred from the depot to a disposal facility and emptied in the next day. The start location of the demand is the same as the depot location. Another example is that the container of a customer is not full and the partly-loaded container is sent to another customer for loading cargoes to increase the load factor of the container, the container stops at intermediate customer locations for loading additional cargoes. In the above examples, the loaded-container demand on the network becomes many-to-many, and may exist between any two vertexes, which is hardly respected by the RRVRP since the RRVRP models use several types of trips to describe customer demand. (iii) In waste collection management practice, the total time of detaching a container and attaching another container is generally several minutes, while the container loading or unloading time is affected by factors as container type, garbage type, temporary overhaul or container cleaning, etc. Depending on the pickup course, the container loading time is generally long. The RRVRP implies an assumption that the container loading/unloading time is relatively short and is consolidated in trips. In trips that integrate the loaded and the empty container legs, the tractor stays with the container throughout the course of a trip, so the tractor has to wait at the disposal facility or customer locations. It is possible for a tractor to serve certain demand by spending the time for container loading or unloading, which may improve the use rate of tractors to optimize the cost. In the situation presented by Wy et al. (2013), if a customer merely requires an empty container with certain characteristics but not necessarily the old loaded one, the customer demand may be satisfied by the tractor transporting an empty container with the required characteristics from a suitable location for exchange instead of the tractor waiting for the emptied container. Li et al. (2017) used the trip decomposition method to distinguish the container loading or unloading time at vertexes and traveling time on arcs in the whole service time of a trip. The trip decomposition method can equivalently transform the trip into origin-destination demand that is characterized by container number and the divided service time. From the methodological perspective, the trip decomposition method is helpful to make some assumptions of the RRVRP to be more practical. Computational experiments showed that permitting tractors to serve certain demand during the tractors\u2019 waiting for container loading/unloading can decrease the total nonproductive time. The G-RRVRP considers specially container loading and unloading time constraints for the possibility of a tractor serving some demand during the container loading and unloading course. The paper aims to present the G-RRVRP to involve some typical realworld issues. The contributions of the paper are:First, the G-RRVRP, which generalizes the practical background, the objective function and the demand flow, and considers specially container loading and unloading time constraints, is introduced. A mixed integer liner programming model that considers two types of demand (i.e., loaded container demand and cargo demand) with time windows and loading/unloading time constraints is provided. Second, the Benders decomposition with acceleration strategies is adopted to solve directly the mathematical model. A two-stage heuristic involving the savings algorithm (CW) and the local search phase is designed to solve the G-RRVRP. Third, the formulation and the heuristic are tested by solving 40 small-scale instances and 20 benchmark instances. Small-scale instances can be solved directly by CPLEX through Benders decomposition strategies to find exact solutions. The case study aims to show the applicability of the G-RRVRP model and the savings-based heuristic to real-life problems. 2 The G-RRVRP definition and mathematical formulation 2.1 Problem description The transport network of the G-RRVRP includes one depot, one container pool and a number of customers. The container pool is defined as the location for supplying, receiving and holding empty containers. The locations of all vertexes, and the demand with time window of each customer are known in advance. The depot holds enough homogenous tractors. The objective of the G-RRVRP is to determine tractor routes to minimize the total running cost of tractors in the planning period. Compared with the RRVRP, the G-RRVRP has the following characteristics. (i) Since the disposal facility of the RRVRP acts simultaneously as the destination of loaded containers and the origin of empty containers, the G-RRVRP divides the disposal facility location of the RRVRP into two types of locations: one is the type of customer locations for receiving loaded containers, the other is the container pool location for supplying empty containers. (ii) The RRVRP, which only considers loaded-container demand, is similar to the full truckload VRP (Wy et al., 2013). From the cargo flow angle, the G-RRVRP divides the customer demand into two types at the beginning of the planning period. The first is loaded-container demand, i.e., the loaded container waiting for transport between two customers. The second is cargo demand, i.e., cargoes waiting for loading into a new-arrived empty-container and then for transporting between two customers. Demand may exist between any two customers. It is assumed that a customer only has one of the two types of demand, and the two types of customers are denoted as LC and CC, respectively. A LC has loaded container demand. A CC, who needs empty container provision at the beginning, has cargo demand. (iii) Customers have known time-windows. The time windows of LCs (i.e., customers with loaded container demand) ensure the loaded containers arriving at the destination on time. The time windows of CCs (i.e., customers with cargo demand) constrain the arrival time of new-arrived empty-containers while the time for loading operation should not be ignored. (iv) The RRVRP usually ignores the empty container repositioning constraints. For example, De Meulemeester et al. (1997) and Bodin et al. (2000) assumed an unlimited number of containers for use, and they did not consider a location for keeping empty containers. Baldacci et al. (2006) assumed that an infinite number of containers are stored at some locations. In practice many factors cause the empty container repositioning (Chen et al., 2016). In the G-RRVRP, a new-arrived loaded-container turns to be an empty container when the transport and unloading process is finished. At the end of the planning period, each customer location can keep a certain number of containers, and the number of containers kept at a customer location is affected by some factors (such as the parking area). The excess empty containers at customer locations should be returned to the container pool in the planning period. Besides, the customers keeping containers at the end of the last planning period may provide empty containers at the beginning of the present planning period. (v) Tractors are permitted to wait at vertexes, and the penalty cost of tractor waiting at vertexes is not ignored. Each tractor has the maximum allowable working time in a planning period. The time to attach/detach a container to a tractor, which is generally considerably short, is not specially considered in the G-RRVRP. It is assumed that a used tractor can serve the same customer at most once. (vi) In the G-RRVRP, each tractor begins and ends its route at the depot. A tractor may transport a loaded container from a customer to another customer, transport an empty container from the container pool to a customer, transport an empty container from a customer to the container pool, transport an empty container from one customer to another customer, or travel alone. Tractors with various states of travelling on arcs consume different running costs. The G-RRVRP takes the minimization of the total running cost from tractor routing as the objective function. Because fuel consumption is the most expensive variable cost of the transportation process for road freight transportation companies (Banos et al., 2013), the G-RRVRP aims to minimize the total fuel consumption (unit: litre, denoted as \u201cL\u201d), which means to take one of the most important running costs as the objective. The RRVRP is the special case of the G-RRVRP, if the cargo demand is not distinguished and the disposal facility location is not divided into loaded-container destination customers and the empty-container origin location (i.e., the container pool). The G-RRVRP involves designing tractor routes for transporting loaded containers or cargoes (waiting for loading and then for transporting), and involves the empty container reposition among vertexes. Container loading/unloading time is specially considered. Fig. 1 shows an example of the G-RRVRP with nine customers. There are two loaded containers waiting for transport at customer locations 5 and 6, and two customers (i.e., customer 1 and customer 2) needing empty containers for loading cargoes at the beginning. A customer (i.e., customer 9) keeps one empty container for delivery at the beginning, if needed. Tractor route data include the passed-vertexes and the arrival time at each vertex. There are three tractor routes indicated by the vertex sequence: 0-6-8-1-4-0, 0-12-2-3-11-4-10-0, and 0-9-1-5-7-0. At a vertex, there probably are different arrival times of various tractor routes, which decide the operation sequence of empty-container arrival, empty-container loading, loaded-container transport and loaded-container unloading. For example, customer 1 in route \u201c0-6-8-1-4-0\u201d needs one empty container, which is satisfied by the provision of customer 9 included in route \u201c0-9-1-5-7-0\u201d. That is, one tractor for route \u201c0-9-1-5-7-0\u201d transports an empty container from customer 9 to customer 1, and the tractor for route \u201c0-9-1-5-7-0\u201d does not wait at customer 1 for the empty container loading; another tractor for route \u201c0-6-8-1-4-0\u201d transports the new-loaded container from customer 1 to customer 4. We take the route \u201c0-12-2-3-11-4-10-0\u201d as an example to describe the operation sequence for serving the cargo demand in the G-RRVRP. In the route vertexes 11 and 12 denote virtual container pools. In a route the tractor may visit the container pool more than once. There are probably more than one arriving time of the tractor at the container pool. Some virtual container pools with the same location as the real container pool are set to make a tractor visit a vertex (except the depot) at most once in a route. First, the tractor departs from the depot and runs alone to the container pool. The tractor attaches one empty container at the container pool and transports the empty container to customer 2. Second, at customer 2 cargoes are loaded onto the new-arrived empty container, and the new-loaded container is transported from customer 2 to customer 3. Third, at customer 3 the new-arrived loaded container is unloaded. Because customer 3 is assumed not to hold any container at the end of the planning period, the new-unloaded container (i.e., an empty container) is transported to the container pool. Fourth, the tractor departs from the container pool and runs alone to customer 4. At customer 4, the tractor attaches the new-unloaded container (note: the loaded container is from customer 1) and transports the empty container to the container pool, since customer 4 is assumed not to hold any container at the end of the planning period. Finally, the tractor returns alone to the depot. 2.2 The mathematical formulation for the G-RRVRP We propose a mixed integer linear programming model to describe the G-RRVRP. The mixed integer linear programming model is expressed by the vehicle flow formulation. The G-RRVRP is a generalized variant of the RRVRP. Commercial IP solver software (e.g., CPLEX) may provide a benchmark for some small-scale instances of the G-RRVRP. The interest of exact methods by commercial IP solver software is in finding exact solutions for testing heuristics. The vehicle flow formulation we present in the paper can be directly solved by CPLEX 12.4. The parameters and variables are listed in Table 1 . Let V 0 , V 1 , V 2 , and V be the depot set, the customer set, the container pool set and the vertex set, respectively, where V 0 = { 0 } , V 1 = { 1 , . . . , n } , V 2 = { n + 1 , . . . , n + m } , V = V 0 \u222a V 1 \u222a V 2 . In a route the tractor may visit the container pool several times so that there are probably more than one arriving time of the tractor at the container pool. A certain number (i.e., m) of container pools with the same location are set to ensure each tractor visiting a vertex (except the depot which permits a tractor to visit two times) in a route no more than once. The set of tractors held by the depot is denoted as K. The maximum allowable working time of each tractor in a planning period is denoted as T max . The waiting cost of a tractor for a unit of time at vertexes is denoted as \u03b2. Let A be the arc set and A\u202f=\u202f{(i, j)|i, j \u2208 V, i \u2260 j}. The fuel consumption of a tractor pulling a loaded container covering arc (i, j), that of a tractor pulling an empty container covering arc (i, j) and that of a tractor alone covering arc (i, j) are denoted as c i j f , c i j e , and c i j t , respectively. The travelling time of a tractor or a tractor with a container covering arc (i, j) is denoted as t i j . For CCs, let rij be the cargo demand from CC i to CC j at the beginning of the planning period. rij is estimated as the number of loaded containers. For LCs, let wij be the loaded container demand from LC i to LC j at the beginning of the planning period. At the end of the planning period, the maximum number of containers that may be kept by customer j ( j \u2208 V 1 ) is denoted as Nj . The time window of customer i ( i \u2208 V 1 ) is [ E T i , L T i ] . At customer locations, the time for unloading a loaded container or the time for loading an empty container is denoted as \u03b4 1 or \u03b4 2 . In the G-RRVRP model the number (i.e., m) of container pools is estimated by the parameter r i j . We explain as follows. The container pool is assumed to be the location for supplying, receiving and holding empty containers. At the beginning of the planning period, the maximum number of needed empty-containers is decided by the demand of CCs. If the needed empty-containers are provided only by the container pool, i.e., there are no customers keeping containers at the end of the last planning period, the maximum number of empty containers needed by CCs should be no less than the sum of r i j ( i \u2208 V 1 , j \u2208 V 1 ). The following decision variables is introduced. a t i k is the arrival time of the kth tractor at vertex i and w t i k is the waiting time of the kth tractor at vertex i, where i \u2208 V and k \u2208 K. y k is the binary variable which is 1 only if the kth tractor is used. x i j k f is the binary variable which is 1 only if the kth tractor pulling a loaded container covers arc (i, j). x i j k e is the binary variable which is 1 only if the kth tractor pulling an empty container covers arc (i, j). x i j k t is the binary variable which is 1 only if the kth tractor alone covers the arc (i, j). The G-RRVRP is formulated as the following mixed integer linear programming model. The objective function: (1) min z = \u2211 i \u2208 V \u2211 j \u2208 V \u2211 k \u2208 K x i j k f \u00b7 c i j f + \u2211 i \u2208 V \u2211 j \u2208 V \u2211 k \u2208 K x i j k e \u00b7 c i j e + \u2211 i \u2208 V \u2211 j \u2208 V \u2211 k \u2208 K x i j k t \u00b7 c i j t + \u2211 i \u2208 V \u2211 k \u2208 K ( w t i k \u00b7 \u03b2 ) Subject to (2) w i j + r i j = \u2211 k \u2208 K x i j k f , \u2200 i , j \u2208 V 1 , i \u2260 j (3) \u2211 j \u2208 V \u2216 { 0 } x 0 j k t = y k , \u2200 k \u2208 K (4) \u2211 j \u2208 V ( x i j k f + x i j k t + x i j k e ) = \u2211 j \u2208 V ( x j i k f + x j i k t + x j i k e ) \u2264 y k , \u2200 i \u2208 V , \u2200 k \u2208 K (5) x i j k t + x j l k t \u2264 1 , \u2200 i , l \u2208 V , \u2200 j \u2208 V \u2216 { 0 } , \u2200 k \u2208 K (6) \u2211 i \u2208 V \u2211 j \u2208 V t i j \u00b7 ( x i j k f + x i j k t + x i j k e ) + \u2211 i \u2208 V w t i k < T max , \u2200 k \u2208 K (7) \u2211 i \u2208 V \u2216 { 0 } \u2211 k \u2208 K ( x i j k f + x i j k e ) \u2212 \u2211 l \u2208 V \u2216 { 0 } \u2211 k \u2208 K ( x j l k f + x j l k e ) \u2264 N j , \u2200 j \u2208 V 1 (8-1) a t i k + w t i k \u2212 M \u00d7 ( 1 \u2212 \u2211 j \u2208 V 1 x i j k f ) \u2264 L T i , \u2200 i \u2208 V 1 , \u2200 k \u2208 K (8-2) a t i k + w t i k + M \u00d7 ( 1 \u2212 \u2211 j \u2208 V 1 x i j k f ) \u2265 E T i , \u2200 i \u2208 V 1 , \u2200 k \u2208 K (9-1) a t i k + t i j + w t i k \u2212 M \u00d7 ( 1 \u2212 x i j k f ) \u2264 a t j k , \u2200 i , j \u2208 V 1 , \u2200 k \u2208 K (9-2) a t i k + t i j + w t i k + M \u00d7 ( 1 \u2212 x i j k f ) \u2265 a t j k , \u2200 i , j \u2208 V 1 , \u2200 k \u2208 K (9-3) a t i k + t i j + w t i k \u2212 M \u00d7 ( 1 \u2212 x i j k e ) \u2264 a t j k , \u2200 i , j \u2208 V \u2216 { 0 } , \u2200 k \u2208 K (9-4) a t i k + t i j + w t i k + M \u00d7 ( 1 \u2212 x i j k e ) \u2265 a t j k , \u2200 i , j \u2208 V \u2216 { 0 } , \u2200 k \u2208 K (9-5) a t i k + t i j \u2212 M \u00d7 ( 1 \u2212 x i j k t ) \u2264 a t j k , \u2200 i \u2208 V \u2216 { 0 } , \u2200 j \u2208 V , \u2200 k \u2208 K (9-6) a t i k + t i j + M \u00d7 ( 1 \u2212 x i j k t ) \u2265 a t j k , \u2200 i \u2208 V \u2216 { 0 } , \u2200 j \u2208 V , \u2200 k \u2208 K (10) a t i k 1 + \u03b4 1 \u2212 M \u00d7 ( 1 \u2212 \u2211 j \u2208 V 1 x j i k 1 f ) \u2264 a t l k 2 \u2212 t i l + M \u00d7 ( 1 \u2212 x i l k 2 e ) , \u2200 i \u2208 V 1 , \u2200 l \u2208 V \u2216 { 0 } , \u2200 k 1 , k 2 \u2208 K (11) a t i k 1 + \u03b4 2 \u2212 M \u00d7 ( 1 \u2212 \u2211 j \u2208 V \u2216 { 0 } x j i k 1 e ) \u2264 a t l k 2 \u2212 t i l + M \u00d7 ( 1 \u2212 x i l k 2 f ) , \u2200 i , l \u2208 V 1 , \u2200 k 1 , k 2 \u2208 K (12) \u2211 j \u2208 V 1 x i j k e \u2212 M \u00d7 ( 1 \u2212 \u2211 j \u2208 V 1 r i j \u2212 \u2211 j \u2208 V 1 w i j ) \u2264 0 , \u2200 i \u2208 V 1 , \u2200 k \u2208 K (13) \u2211 j \u2208 V 1 r i j = \u2211 j \u2208 V \u2216 { 0 } \u2211 k \u2208 K x j i k e , \u2200 i \u2208 V 1 x i j k f \u2208 { 0 , 1 } , \u2200 i , j \u2208 V , \u2200 k \u2208 K x i j k t \u2208 { 0 , 1 } , \u2200 i , j \u2208 V , \u2200 k \u2208 K x i j k e \u2208 { 0 , 1 } , \u2200 i , j \u2208 V , \u2200 k \u2208 K y k \u2208 { 0 , 1 } , \u2200 k \u2208 K x i i k f = 0 , \u2200 i \u2208 V , \u2200 k \u2208 K x i i k t = 0 , \u2200 i \u2208 V , \u2200 k \u2208 K (14) x i i k e = 0 , \u2200 i \u2208 V , \u2200 k \u2208 K To minimize the total running cost of used tractors in the planning period, the objective function (1) includes four parts: the fuel consumption of used tractors pulling loaded containers traveling on arcs; the fuel consumption of used tractors pulling empty containers traveling on arcs; the fuel consumption of used tractors traveling alone on arcs; and the penalty cost of used tractors waiting at vertexes. To estimate the penalty cost of tractors\u2019 waiting at vertexes (i.e., the last part of the objective function), we introduce the parameter \u03b2 to denote the waiting cost of a used-tractor for a unit of time at vertexes. It is assumed that the waiting cost at vertexes in terms of money unit of a tractor is estimated by referring to enterprises\u2019 experiences. The waiting cost in terms of money unit is then transformed to that in terms of fuel consumption unit by referring to the average price per litre of diesel. Constraints (2) guarantee that the customer demand (including loaded-container and cargo demand) is satisfied. Constraints (3) and (4) ensure that used tractors depart from the depot and return finally to the depot. The degree balance, and that each tractor can serve the same customer at most once are guaranteed by Constraints (4). Constraints (5) require that a tractor should not travel alone on two successive arcs. The maximum working time of each tractor in a planning period, which is defined as the sum of a tractor's travelling time on arcs and the waiting time at vertexes, is respected by Constraints (6). Constraints (7) guarantee that the number of empty and loaded containers kept at a customer location does not exceed a maximum number at the end of the planning period. At the end of the planning period, the number of containers kept at a customer location is decided by the sum of empty containers and loaded containers arriving at the customer and the sum of empty containers and loaded containers sent to other customers. Constraints (8-1) and (8-2) guarantee that time windows of customers are respected. Constraints (9-1)\u2013(9-6) respect the time relationship of a tractor's arriving time at two adjacent vertexes. Constraints (10) ensure that the departure time of the new-emptied container at a customer is not earlier than the corresponding loaded container's arriving time while the unloading time is considered. Constraints (11) ensure that the departure time of the new-loaded container at a customer is not earlier than the corresponding empty container's arriving time while the loading time is considered. Constraints (12) ensure that there is no empty container departing from a customer if the customer has loaded container demand or cargo demand waiting for loading and transport. Constraints (13) guarantee that a customer needs empty containers when there is cargo demand at the customer location. The domain of decision variables are specified, and some variables are initialized by constraints (14). Our computational experiments on some randomly-generated small-scale instances show that the G-RRVRP formulation presented in the paper can be directly solved by CPLEX 12.4. However, CPLEX 12.4 fails to solve directly the majority of randomly-generated small-scale instances, because of excessive memory (specifications of the computer architecture: Intel(R) Core(TM) 3.2\u202fGHz processor with 8GB memory, using Windows 8). The G-RRVRP formulation is hard to solve directly due to a significantly large number of variables and constraints involved. For example, an instance with 10 customers among which 2 customers have loaded container demand and 3 customers have cargo demand, which involves 2468 variables and 17,836 constraints, cannot be solved directly by CPLEX 12.4 because of excessive memory. To solve the G-RRVRP, we use two approaches. The first is the exact method that solves directly the G-RRVRP formulation through the Benders decomposition strategies, which seeks the exact optimum routes. The second is that of a two-stage heuristic that does not find an exact optimum. The two-stage heuristic consists of the savings-based algorithm and the local search phase. 2.3 The Benders decomposition As a classical decomposition technique used for solving the mixed integer programming problem (MIP), the Benders decomposition (BD) algorithm is based on the partition and delayed constraint generation (Benders, 1962). The BD algorithm firstly decomposes the original MIP formulation into a master problem (MP) and a subproblem (SP), then solves each problem iteratively by utilizing the solution of one in the other. The MP includes some variables in the original MIP problem and the associated constraints. The SP is obtained by fixing the variables which are included in the MP of the original MIP problem, and its dual (DSP) is easily obtained and utilized to generate a Benders cut that is later added to the MP to reconstruct the MP through the use of an auxiliary variable. In an iteration, an optimal solution of the MP that provides a lower bound (in the case of minimization objective) is transmitted to the DSP for constructing a new DSP. By resolving the DSP, the value of dual variables and a valid upper bound (in the case of minimization objective) are obtained, then a Benders cut is generated. By introducing new Benders cuts, the MP is resolved. The BD is continuously iterated until the difference between the lower bound and the best upper bound in some iterations is small enough or equals to zero. 2.3.1 The decomposition strategy In our computational experiments on some randomly-generated small-scale instances, two types of decomposition strategies are tried. In the first decomposition strategy, the SP is obtained by fixing the integer variables x i j k f , x i j k e , x i j k t , y k of the G-RRVRP formulation. In the second decomposition strategy, the SP is obtained by fixing the integer variables x i j k f , x i j k e , x i j k t , y k and the continuous variable a t i k of the G-RRVRP formulation. The computational experiments on some randomly-generated instances with up to 16 customers (which involves 9562 variables and 105,953 constraints) show that the second decomposition strategy can ensure better calculation capacity. By fixing the integer variables x i j k f , x i j k e , x i j k t , y k and the continuous variable a t i k in the G-RRVRP formulation, we obtain the MP, the SP, the DSP and the relaxed master problem (RMP) for the G-RRVRP formulation . The MP is as follows. min Z = \u2211 i \u2208 V \u2211 j \u2208 V \u2211 k \u2208 K x i j k f \u00b7 c i j f + \u2211 i \u2208 V \u2211 j \u2208 V \u2211 k \u2208 K x i j k e \u00b7 c i j e + \u2211 i \u2208 V \u2211 j \u2208 V \u2211 k \u2208 K x i j k t \u00b7 c i j t Subject to constraints (2)\u2013(5), (7), (9-5), (9-6), (10) and (11). The MP includes the variables x i j k f , x i j k e , x i j k t , y k and a t i k . Solving firstly the MP, we can attain the initial solution of the five variables. x S o l i j k f \u00af , x S o l i j k e \u00af , x S o l i j k t \u00af , y S o l \u00af k or a t S o l i k \u00af are used to denote the initial solution of x i j k f , x i j k e , x i j k t , y k or a t i k , respectively. The SP is as follows. (15) min Z = \u2211 i \u2208 V \u2211 k \u2208 K ( w t i k \u00b7 \u03b2 ) Subject to constraints (6), (8-1), (8-2) and (9-1)\u2013(9-4).

By introducing an additional free variable temp, the MIP relaxation of (1)\u2013(14) is reformulated as the following problem (i.e., the RMP).

(22) t e m p \u2265 D var e (23) 0 \u2265 D var e Constraints (22) are the optimality cuts and constraints (23) are the feasibility cuts obtained by solving the DSP. For each iteration, constraints (22) or (23) are Benders cuts that are added into the MP. If the DSP has no boundary, constraints (23) are used to reconstructing the MP. If the DSP has the optimal value, constraints (22) are used to reconstructing the MP. To accelerate the convergence of the BD algorithm, the following two valid inequalities (24) and (25) are added to the RMP so as to restrict the feasible zone. Constraints (24) restrict the decision variable domain by the situations where there is no loaded-container departing from the depot or arriving at the container pool. Constraints (25) indicate that in a route the arrival time at the vertex next to the depot should not be negative and the time of tractors departing from the depot is assumed to be 0. Constraints (24) and (25) are empirically proposed through our computational trials on randomly-generated small-scale instances.

In the literature, Pareto-optimal cuts can effectively improve the performance of the BD algorithm. A Pareto-optimal cut exists when the DSP has several optimal solutions. Papadakos (2008) presented an improved method for the generation of Pareto-optimal cuts. It was proved that it is not necessary to find a core point of the solution space of the MP to produce a Pareto-optimal cut. A convex combination of the current MP solution and the previously used core point suffices for obtaining a new core point at each iteration. To implement the BD with Pareto-optimal cuts, the auxiliary problem (AP) is added to generate the Pareto-optimal cuts. In the AP, \u201cwor ker obj\u201d denotes the objective value of the SP for the current iteration. x S o l i j k f \u00af , x S o l i j k t \u00af , x S o l i j k e \u00af , a t S o l i k \u00af are as the relaxed solutions of the MP for the current iteration, and x c i j k f \u00af , x c i j k t \u00af , x c i j k e \u00af and a t c i k \u00af are the approximate cores.

In our computational experiments, we set \u03bb\u202f=\u202f0.5. On condition of an attained objective value of the SP, constraints (27) are used to attain optimality cuts through solving the AP, and the attained optimality cuts are Pareto-optimal. Pareto-optimal cuts are used to reconstructing the MP. 2.3.3 The programme strategy The BD is usually programmed by two ways. The classical way involves reconstructing and solving exactly the MP at each iteration. The classical implementation of the BD includes that the MP is solved to optimality at each iteration, which becomes increasingly difficult with each successive iteration because new cuts are added into the MP at each iteration. The recent way aims to decrease the workload for solving the reconstructed MP (e.g., Vatsa and Jayaswal, 2015; Memi\u015fo\u011flu and \u00dcster, 2015). At each iteration, instead of the attained exact-solution of the reconstructed MP, a feasible solution of the MP is needed for solving the DSP. Referring to Rubin (2011), we implement the BD algorithm by using the callback function whenever new Benders cuts can be generated in the MP solution. The callback function is provided by the commercial solver CPLEX. In Benders decomposition-callback implementation (the process is shown in Fig. 2 ), whenever a feasible solution (called incumbent solution) is found while solving the MP at each iteration, the DSP is constructed and solved to generate new Benders cuts. If the DSP has no boundary, the feasibility cuts obtained by solving the DSP are regarded as the new-generated Benders cuts. If the DSP has the optimal value, the optimality cuts obtained by solving the DSP are regarded as the new-generated Benders cuts. Based on the obtained optimality cuts, Pareto-optimal cuts adopted in the paper are attained by solving the AP defined in Section 2.3.2. The generated Benders cuts and the attained Pareto-optimal cuts are then regarded as the lazy constraints and used for reconstructing the MP. The process of solving the MP incorporating the lazy constraints is resumed on the current solution tree. Although a certain number of DSPs and APs are solved in the whole process, the MP branch-and-cut solution tree is constructed and solved to optimality only once. 3 The two-stage heuristic Our heuristic consists of two phases: the first phase aims to construct an initial solution by the modified CW algorithm; and the second phase aims to improve the initial solution by the local search algorithm. The computational experiments show that the two-stage heuristic is adaptable and very easy to understand and reproduce. In fact, the CW algorithm combined with a search phase was widely adopted to solve various types of routing problems in the literature (e.g., Chu, 2005; Lai et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015,2016,2017,2018). To succinctly describe the heuristic, we introduce several definitions as follows. Definition 1 An origin-destination pair and the connecting arc with tractor pulling a container covering the arc is called a single-carrying-leg in a route. There are two types of single-carrying-legs, one is the loaded single-carrying-leg and the other is the empty single-carrying-leg. The loaded single-carrying-leg involves an arc covered by a tractor with a loaded container, and the empty single-carrying-leg involves an arc covered by a tractor with an empty container. Definition 2 If two single-carrying-legs are adjacent in a route, i.e., the destination of one single-carrying-leg is as the origin of the other single-carrying-leg, the segment of the two adjacent single-carrying-legs is called a double-carrying-leg. Definition 3 If a double-carrying-leg and a single-carrying-leg are adjacent in a route, i.e., the destination (or origin) of the double-carrying-leg and the origin (or destination) of the single-carrying-leg are the same, the segment constituted by the double-carrying-leg and the single-carrying-leg is called a triple-carrying-leg. Definition 4 An origin-destination pair and the connecting arc without any container travelling on the arc is called an empty-leg in a route. Definition 5 A feasible solution (the former) can be transformed to another feasible solution (the latter) by certain operators. If the total running cost of the latter is no larger than that of the former, we call the transformation a satisfied-operator method. Definition 6 The merging operation must satisfy the following requirements: the maximum working time of each tractor in a planning period is respected; customers\u2019 time windows are ensured; and a customer is served only once. The above requirements are called the merging requirements. Definition 7 The 1\u202f\u00d7\u202fn matrix (called num_empty) is used to denote the number of empty containers kept at each customer location at the beginning of the planning period, where n is the number of customers. Definition 8 The 1\u202f\u00d7\u202fn matrix (called demand_empty) is used to denote the empty container demand of customers that is decided by cargo demand, where n is the number of customers. 3.1 The initial solution A definition \u201cdirect trip\u201d is introduced in constructing the initial solution. In a direct trip, a tractor departs from the depot to serve one single-carrying-leg and then returns to the depot. A direct trip in the initial solution is denoted as 0-i-j-0, where i-j is a single-carrying-leg while 0-i and j-0 are empty-legs. The set of direct trips (denoted as R) includes two subsets: the subset L_R in which a direct trip involves the loaded single-carrying-leg and the subset E_R in which a direct trip involves the empty single-carrying-leg. R\u202f=\u202fL_R\u222a E_R. In subset L_R or E_R, each direct trip is included in a type by the origin-destination pair of the involved single-carrying-leg, i.e., the same type of direct trips has the same origin and destination of single-carrying-legs. The number of direct trips in a type is denoted as Rnum. sumRnum is the total of Rnum of all types. With the merging operator decreasing the number of direct trips in R, sumRnum decreases to 0. Let R 1 \u202f=\u202f0-i-\u2026-j-0 be an unfinished route and the corresponding running cost is c 1. Let R 2\u202f=\u202f0-h-l-0 and R 3\u202f=\u202f0-k-m-0 be two direct trips in set R and the corresponding running costs are c 2 and c 3, respectively. Merging R 1 with R 2 or R 3, respectively, two new routes 0-i-\u2026-j-h-l-0 and 0-i-\u2026-j-k-m-0 are obtained. Supposing that the tractor pulls a loaded container from j to h (or k) in the two new routes, the usual savings of the merging operation are c j 0 t + c 0 h t \u2212 c j h f and c j 0 t + c 0 k t \u2212 c j k f for the two new routes respectively, where c j 0 t , c 0 h t and c 0 k t are the running costs of the tractor traveling alone on the arcs (j, 0), (0, h) and (0, k) respectively, and c j h f and c j k f the running costs of the tractor traveling with a loaded container on the arcs (j, h) and (j, k). In the G-RRVRP, there are customers who keep empty containers for delivery if needed at the beginning, e.g., customer 9 in Fig. 1. In subset E_R, the candidate empty single-carrying-legs probably have a same origin. If R 2 and R 3 have a same origin (i.e., h\u202f=\u202fk), c j 0 t + c 0 h t \u2212 c j h f and c j 0 t + c 0 k t \u2212 c j k f are equal. Since the G-RRVRP objective function is to minimize the total running cost of tractor routes, and using the CW algorithm to construct the initial solution is probable to fall into local optimization, we suggest to use an integrated savings to decide the merging operation. The integrated savings of merging R 1 and R 2 is c j 0 t + c 0 h t \u2212 c j h f \u2212 0.01\u00b7c2 , and the integrated savings of merging R 1 and R 3 is c j 0 t + c 0 k t \u2212 c j k f \u2212 0.01\u00b7c3 . The merging operation with a larger integrated savings is adopted. Besides, in order to avoid the integrated savings being less than 0, a coefficient is multiplied before the cost of the direct trip for merging. The value of the coefficient is 0.01 in the paper. To construct a new route with constraints (6) limiting the merging course, a direct trip whose Rnum is not 0 is randomly selected and merged with all other direct trips, then the integrated savings are calculated and sorted. The merging result with the maximum integrated savings is selected on condition of the merging requirements being satisfied. Or, the merging result with the second maximum integrated savings is selected on condition of the merging requirements being satisfied. That is, the merging results with the sorted integrated savings are selected one by one until the merging requirements are satisfied. The solution is constructed route by route until all of the direct trips in the set R are used, i.e., until sumRnum\u202f=\u202f0. The modified CW algorithm for the G-RRVRP is implemented as follows. Step 1: Initialize num_empty and demand_empty. According to the cargo demand between CCs, the loaded container demand between LCs and the maximum number of containers kept by a customer at the end of the planning period, initialize the subset L_R and E_R. R\u202f=\u202fL_R \u222a E_R. Initialize Rnum and sumRnum. Initialize an empty set newR that can provisionally save a route and initialize an empty set solution for saving the initial solution. Step 2: Calculate the sumRnum. If sumRnum\u202f>\u202f0, the set R is not empty and there are single-carrying-legs needing service, and go to Step 3. Otherwise, stop and output the solution. Step 3: If newR is empty, choose randomly a direct trip from R and put the chosen direct trip into newR. The corresponding Rnum is renewed. Step 4: Based on the merging operation, the integrated savings are calculated. By sorting the integrated savings, a direct trip is selected and merged with the unfinished route in newR. When the merging requirements are satisfied, the unfinished route in newR is substituted by the merging results. The corresponding Rnum is renewed. If the unfinished route in newR is renewed in Step 4, go to Step 2 to try a next merging operation. Otherwise, go to Step 5. Step 5: Adopt the route in newR as an element of solution and empty newR. Update num_empty and demand_empty and go to Step 2 to continue the route-construction course. The instance in Fig. 1 is used as an example to show the construction process of the initial solution. Customer demand and time windows are shown in Tables 2 and 3 . The loaded single-carrying-legs \u201c0-1-4-0\u201d, \u201c0-2-3-0\u201d, \u201c0-5-7-0\u201d, and \u201c0-6-8-0\u201d according to customer demand information are given. Nj is assumed and known in advance and shown in Table 3. First, Initialize num_empty\u202f=\u202f[0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1] and demand_empty\u202f=\u202f[1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Comparing num_empty and Nj , the possible empty single-carrying-legs \u201c0-4-2-0\u201d, \u201c0-4-11-0\u201d, \u201c0-3-1-0\u201d, \u201c0-3-11-0\u201d, \u201c0-10-1-0\u201d, \u201c0-10-2-0\u201d, \u201c0-9-1-0\u201d, and \u201c0-9-2-0\u201d are given. That is, on condition of customer time windows and container loading/unloading time constraints being ignored, the empty containers kept at CC 3 and CC 4 may be transported to other CCs or to the container pool. The empty containers needed by CC 1 and CC 2 may be from CC 3, CC 4, the container pool or customers that hold containers at the beginning. All the direct trips are shown in Table 4 , and sumRnum\u202f=\u202f12. Second, randomly choose a direct trip, e.g., R 1\u202f=\u202f0-1-4-0 from the set R as the direct trip for the merging operation, and put R 1 into the set newR. The sumRnum decreases by 1, and Rnum(R 1)\u202f=\u202f0. Merge R 1 with any one of the other direct trips in the set R, and calculate the integrated savings (Table 5 ). We can see that both merging R 1 with R 7 and merging R 1 with R 11 have the same maximum integrated savings. Take the merged direct trip R 11 as an example to show the application of the modified CW algorithm. Merge R 11 with R 1 to obtain a new route \u201c0-9-1-4-0\u201d, and the merging requirements are satisfied, Rnum(R 11)\u202f=\u202f0. The empty container demand of CC 1 is satisfied. As a result, Rnum(R 9)\u202f=\u202f0, Rnum(R 7)\u202f=\u202f0 and Rnum(R 12)\u202f=\u202f0. The route \u201cR 11-R 1\u201d is merged with any one of the other direct trips in the set R, the integrated savings are calculated and shown in Table 6 . Randomly select a direct trip from the two direct trips with the same maximum integrated savings, and take R 5 for example. By the merging operation the renewed route \u201c0-9-1-4-2-0\u201d that satisfies the merging requirements is obtained, so Rnum(R 5)\u202f=\u202f0, Rnum(R 6)\u202f=\u202f0 and Rnum(R 10)\u202f=\u202f0. The route \u201cR 11-R 1-R 5\u201d is merged with any one of the other direct trips in the set R, the integrated savings are calculated and shown in Table 7 . Select R 2 with the maximum integrated savings to merge, the renewed route \u201c0-9-1-4-2-3-0\u201d, of which the tractor's working time does not satisfy the merging requirements, is obtained. Select R 3 or R 4 with the second or third maximum integrated savings to merge, it is found that the tractor's working time does not satisfy the merging requirements. The merging results are not adopted. So far the first route of the initial solution \u201c0-9-1-4-2-0\u201d is constructed. Update the matrix num_empty\u202f=\u202f[0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0] and demand_empty\u202f=\u202f[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Third, the second route is to be constructed. Randomly select a direct trip R 2 (whose Rnum is not 0) from the set R for the merging operation, and put R 2 into the set newR. The sumRnum decreases by 1, and Rnum(R 2)\u202f=\u202f0. Merge R 2 with any one of the other direct trips in the set R, and calculate the integrated savings (Table 8 ). Select R 8 with the maximum integrated savings to merge with R 2, a new route \u201c0-2-3-11-0\u201d, which satisfies the merging requirements, is obtained. As a result, Rnum(R 8)\u202f=\u202f0. Then, the route \u201cR 2-R 8\u201d is merged with any one of the direct trips in the set R, the integrated savings is shown in Table 9 . Randomly select a direct trip from the two direct trips with the same maximum integrated savings, and take R 3 for example. Through the merging operation the renewed route \u201c0-5-7-2-3-11-0\u201d, which satisfies the merging requirements, is obtained. The second route \u201c0-5-7-2-3-11-0\u201d is constructed. Update num_empty\u202f=\u202f[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0] and demand_empty\u202f=\u202f[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Fourth, now there is only one direct trip (i.e., R 4) in the set R. Put R 4 into the set solution. sumRnum\u202f=\u202f0, which implies that all customer demand are satisfied. The construction of the initial solution is finished. 3.2 The local search phase The local search phase aims to search the neighborhood of the new solution space so as to improve the initial solution. Eight neighborhoods are used to achieve a locally optimal solution. Fig. 3 gives examples for the eight operators used in the heuristic computation on the example in Fig. 1. (i) Insertion. The insertion operator includes two types. The first is called the \u201cSCL-insertion\u201d. Randomly select two routes, select a single-carrying-leg from one of the two routes, insert the selected single-carrying-leg into a randomly-selected position of the other route by the satisfied-operator method. The second is called the \u201cDCL-insertion\u201d. Randomly select two routes, one (or two) of the two routes should have at least one double-carrying-leg. Randomly select a double-carrying-leg from one route and insert into a random position of the other route by the satisfied-operator method. (ii) Swap. The swap operator includes three types. The first is called the \u201cSCL-swap\u201d, in which a single-carrying-leg of one randomly-selected route and a single-carrying-leg of another randomly-selected route are swapped by the satisfied-operator method. The second is called the \u201cDCL-swap\u201d. Randomly select two routes, each of the two routes should have at least one double-carrying-leg. Two randomly-selected double-carrying-legs are swapped between the two routes by the satisfied-operator method. The third is called the \u201cTCL-swap\u201d. Randomly select two routes, each of the two routes should have at least one triple-carrying-leg. Two randomly-selected triple-carrying-legs are swapped between the two routes by the satisfied-operator method. (iii) Relocate. Three relocate operators are adopted. The first called the \u201cSCL-relocate\u201d is to relocate two single-carrying-legs in a route by the satisfied-operator method, when the number of single-carrying-legs included in the route is more than two. The second is called the \u201cDCL-relocate\u201d which aims to relocate two double-carrying-legs in a route, when the number of double-carrying-legs in the route is more than two. The third is called the \u201cTCL-relocate\u201d which relocates two triple-carrying-legs in a route, when the number of triple-carrying-legs in the route is more than two. After adopting the eight operators, the new-constructed routes of tractors are adopted on condition of the following constraints being satisfied. 1) the maximum working time of a tractor in a planning period is respected; 2) customers\u2019 time windows are respected; 3) a customer is served only once; 4) constraints that ensure the departure time of the new-emptied container at a customer is not earlier than the corresponding loaded container's arriving time while the unloading time is considered are respected; 5) constraints that ensure the departure time of the new-loaded container at a customer is not earlier than the corresponding empty container's arriving time while the loading time is considered are respected. The local search phase uses the first-accept strategy. We design the implementation strategy for neighborhood operators through computational trials. In each local search iteration, one of the eight operators is selected according to a probability. By generating firstly a random number \u03b8 (0\u202f<\u202f\u03b8\u202f<\u202f1), the corresponding neighborhood operator is determined by the implementation strategy in Table 10 . Each operator is used some times by setting up a large enough number of iterations for the whole local search phase. The local search process continues until the given number of iterations is exhausted. 4 Computational experiments We use the proposed G-RRVRP formulation and solution methods to solve some instances derived from the benchmark instances of the RRVRP. The two-stage heuristic is coded in C++. We use CPLEX12.4 with VS2010 to solve the mathematical formulation of the G-RRVRP through the Benders decomposition strategies. We use several computers with the same software and hardware configurations (i.e., Intel(R) Core(TM) 3.2\u202fGHz processor with 8GB memory, using Windows 8) to run the two types of codes. In the computational experiments, we use the 20 benchmark instances provided by Bodin et al. (2000) and the 40 randomly-generated small-scale instances provided by Li et al. (2017) to generate test instances for the G-RRVRP. (i) We use directly vertex coordinates provided by Bodin et al. (2000) and Li et al. (2017) to design the G-RRVRP network. Referring to parameters in Bodin et al. (2000), the planning period is 6 h, the maximum working time of each tractor in a planning period is 4 h, and the loading or unloading time for a container is 10 min. (ii) In the G-RRVRP, a tractor can travel with a loaded-container on arcs, travel with an empty container on arcs, or travel alone. Tractors with different states of travelling have different running costs. A type of tractors that satisfies No. 11/2009 Decree of the Ministry of Transport of China (MOTC) is used. Referring to the data provided by the MOTC official website (http://atestsc.mot.gov.cn/pub/publish/), the fuel consumption coefficient of a tractor pulling a loaded-container, that of a tractor pulling an empty-container, and that of a tractor running alone are 0.29\u202fL/km, 0.22\u202fL/km and 0.16\u202fL/km, respectively. The penalty cost of a tractor waiting for a unit of time at vertexes is estimated to be 2.75 (L/h). (iii) The demand including the loaded container demand and the cargo demand is estimated by a unit of container. There may exist the one-to-one demand between any two customers. Denote the number of cargo demand as na and the number of loaded container demand as nb . Denote the number of customers that hold empty containers at the beginning as nc . The total number of customers included in an instance is n\u202f=\u202f2na \u202f+\u202f2nb \u202f+\u202fnc . Customers are sequentially numbered from 1 to 2na \u202f+\u202f2nb \u202f+\u202fnc . The customers numbered from 1 to na are randomly listed, and are regarded as the serial origins of cargo demand. The customers numbered from na \u202f+\u202f1 to 2na are sequentially listed, and are regarded as the serial destinations of cargo demand. The customers numbered from 2na \u202f+\u202f1 to 2na \u202f+\u202fnb are randomly listed, and are regarded as the serial origins of loaded-container demand. The customers numbered from 2na \u202f+\u202fnb \u202f+\u202f1 to 2na \u202f+\u202f2nb are sequentially listed, and are regarded as the serial destinations of loaded-container demand. (iv) By the method presented by Solomon (1987), the time window of a customer is generated. The earliest service-starting time of a CC i is denoted as t 1 min \u202f=\u202fmin t 0h \u202f+\u202fthi \u202f+\u202f\u03b42, \u2200h \u2208 [2na \u202f+\u202f2nb \u202f+\u202f1, 2na \u202f+\u202f2nb \u202f+\u202fnc ]\u222aV 2. On condition of the earliest service-starting time being respected, a tractor travels alone from the depot to a location (h) with the shortest running time and pulls an empty container to CC i to load cargoes. The latest service-starting time is denoted as t 2 max \u202f=\u202fT\u202f\u2212\u202ftij \u202f\u2212\u202f\u03b41\u202f\u2212\u202fMAX1, where MAX1 is the maximum value of tjh \u202f+\u202ft h0 (\u2200h \u2208 {[1, na ]\u222aV 2}\\i). On condition of the latest service-starting time being respected, a tractor travels with a loaded container from CC i to the destination, waits for unloading the container, pulls the new-emptied container to a location (h) and returns alone to the depot. The earliest service-starting time of a LC i is denoted as t 3 min \u202f=\u202ft 0i . The latest service-starting time is denoted as t 4 max \u202f=\u202fT\u202f\u2212\u202ftij \u202f\u2212\u202f\u03b41\u202f\u2212\u202fMAX2, where MAX2 is the maximum value of tjh \u202f+\u202ft h0 (\u2200h \u2208 [1, na ]\u222aV 2). On condition of the latest service-starting time being respected, a tractor travels with a loaded container from LC i to the destination, waits for unloading the container, pulls the new-emptied container to a location (h) and returns alone to the depot. 4.1 Small-scale instance results A direct solution of the G-RRVRP formulation through CPLEX12.4 with VS2010 can provide exact solutions for small-scale instances. The quality of heuristic solutions for small-scale instances obtained by the proposed two-stage heuristic is assessed by the comparison with exact solutions. Table 11 presents the computational results of the 40 small-scale instances, which include the results of the model formulation (Columns 3\u20135) and the values of the best solutions found by the two-stage heuristic (Columns 6\u201311). For each instance in our computational experiments, the two-stage heuristic is repeated ten times, and the value and the heuristic running time of the best solution in the ten results is reported. Column 1 indicates the instance. Column 2 shows the number of vertexes involved in each instance (denoted as Vert.) and the number of each type of customers. For the instance solutions of the model formulation, Column 3 indicates the objective value (denoted as Obj), Column 4 indicates the number of used tractors (denoted as K), and Column 5 shows the computation time (in seconds) of the direct solution of the mathematical model. Columns 6 and 7 indicate the values of the initial solution provided by the modified CW algorithm. Columns 8 and 9 indicate the value of the best solution in the ten results obtained by the two-stage heuristic. Column 10 gives the heuristic running time (in seconds) for finding the best solution in the ten results. Column 11 gives the percentage gap between Columns 6 and 8 (denoted as Gap1), i.e., Gap1\u202f=\u202f100%\u202f\u00d7\u202f(ObjCW\u202f\u2212\u202fObj\u201cCW+LS\u201d)/Obj\u201cCW+LS\u201d. Column 12 gives the percentage gap between Columns 3 and 8 (denoted as Gap2), i.e., Gap2\u202f=\u202f100%\u202f\u00d7\u202f(Obj\u201cCW+LS\u201d\u202f\u2212\u202fObjCPLEX) / ObjCPLEX. The computational results of small-scale instances imply that the G-RRVRP formulation performs well while the exact method and the two-stage heuristic are effective. (i) Our computational trials proved that the two-stage heuristic has a general and adaptable structure. For instances with certain scale, the two-stage heuristic does not need instance-related iteration settings. To solve the 40 small-scale instances through the two-stage heuristic, we set the iteration number of the modified CW to be 1000, and set the iteration number of the local search to be 1,000,000. The heuristic running times of the best, the average or the worst solution in the ten repetitions are reported in Fig. 4 . For each small-scale instance, the gap between the heuristic running times of the best solution (denoted as TBS) and that of the worst solution (denoted as TWS), which is described as 100%\u202f\u00d7\u202f(TWS\u202f\u2212\u202fTBS)/(TWS\u202f+\u202fTBS), is between 2.5% and 22.9% and the average equals to 9.7%. It is implied that the two-stage heuristic is relatively stable. Referring to the heuristic running times of the best solution, the two-stage heuristic can solve any one of the 40 small-scale instances in less than 32 s. Of the 40 instances, the computational time is less than 10.0\u202fs in 6 cases, the longest computational time is 31.7\u202fs, and the average computational time equals to 16.2\u202fs. (ii) In terms of the solution quality, the proposed heuristic performs well. Of the 40 instances, the Gap2 is less than 1.0% in 21 cases; the Gap2 is less than 2% in 25 cases. For the 40 instances, the largest Gap2 is 5.0%, and the average equals to 1.8%. Besides, the Gap2 is 0.0% for eight instances, which implies these instances can be solved optimally by the two-stage heuristic. (iii) For the heuristic results, the gap between the value of the initial solution and that of the final solution is relatively large. Of all the 40 instances, the percentage gap between the results of the CW and those of the two-stage heuristic (Gap1) is more than 10%. Gap1 is less than 20% in 7 cases, and Gap1 is more than 30% in 13 cases. The largest Gap1 is 83.6% and the average Gap1 equals to 30.6%. The local search is a necessary and important phase of the two-stage heuristic. (iv) It is worth noting that, of the first 28 small-scale instances with up to 19 vertexes included, the average running time of the mathematical formulation is smaller than that of the two-stage heuristic. Of instances with up to 14 vertexes included, the average running time of the mathematical formulation is clearly smaller than that of the two-stage heuristic. It is suggested that the exact method based on Benders decomposition strategies outperforms the two-stage heuristic in solving very-small-scale instances. Besides, for all the small-scale instances, the standard deviation of the running time of the mathematical formulation is clearly larger than that of the two-stage heuristic. (v) For several instances (e.g., instance 10d-2, 10d-3, 15a-1, 15b-2, 20a-1, 20c-1), the number of used tractors found by the mathematical formulation is smaller than the number of used tractors found by the two-stage heuristic. Accordingly, the objective value of the exact solution found by the mathematical formulation is smaller than that of the best solution found by the two-stage heuristic. It implies that a solution is usually better if a smaller number of tractors are used. 4.2 Benchmark instance results We tried different iteration numbers of the heuristic for the 20 benchmark instances to compare the results. Considering the quality of heuristic solutions and the computation time, we set specific iteration numbers for solving various types of the 20 benchmark instances. Table 12 shows the heuristic results of the 20 benchmark instances. Column 1 indicates the instance. The number of trips and the class type are used to name the instance. For example, an instance denoted as \u201c100a\u201d is derived from the class A instance with 100 trips that is provided by Bodin et al. (2000). Column 2 shows the number of vertexes involved in each instance (denoted as Vert.) and the number of each type of customers. Columns 3 and 4 indicate the values of the initial solutions provided by the modified CW. Columns 6 and 7 indicate the final results of the two-stage heuristic. Column 9 shows the computation time (in seconds). Columns 5 and 8 give the iteration numbers of the CW and those of the local search phase, respectively. Column 10 shows the percentage gap between Columns 3 and 6 (i.e., Gap1). The computation time of the two-stage heuristic for each benchmark instance is less than 137\u202fs. Of 85% of all the benchmark instances, the computation time is less than 120\u202fs. We believe that the two-stage heuristic is able to solve quickly various large-scale instances. By setting fixed iteration numbers, the computation time of any one of large-scale instances was controlled to be acceptable for a tactical or operational problem. Besides, (i) The CW algorithm is a greedy heuristic algorithm, and the initial solution constructed by the modified CW in the two-stage heuristic is feasible for enterprise operations. However, the gaps between the values of the initial solutions and that of the final solutions are large, and it is necessary to adpot the local search to improve the initial solutions. Of the 20 instances, the average of the Gap1 is 30.0%, which is close to the average Gap1 of the 40 small-scale instances. (ii) We can find some optimizing strategies through comparing the initial solutions and the final solutions provided by the two-stage heuristic. For example, the number of routes of the initial solution (denoted as KCW) and that of the two-stage heuristic solution (denoted as KCW+LS) are different. Of any one of the 20 benchmark instances, the percentage gap between KCW and KCW+LS, i.e., Gap3\u202f=\u202f100%\u202f\u00d7\u202f(KCW\u202f\u2212\u202fKCW+LS) / KCW+LS, is over 65.0%. The average Gap3 equals to 125.1%. It implies that more savings can be attained through the route merging operation. 5 Case study As is stated in the Introduction, the G-RRVRP takes both the waste collection management and the intercity linehaul system as the practical backgrounds. The case study aims to show the G-RRVRP application for the intercity linehaul system. Referring to some data provided by a logistics company in China, we design some realistic-size instances for the case study. Computational results of realistic instances are analyzed to evaluate the applicability of the G-RRVRP model and the two-stage heuristic for realistic-size problems. 5.1 Case description We design the realistic instances by referring to some operating data provided by a logistics company in Shandong province of China (denoted as SDHLG in the paper). SDHLG operates 23 city-distribution-centers (CDCs) distributed in Shandong province (Fig. 5 ). Cargoes transported by SDHLG's vehicles involve almost all types of goods. At the beginning of each planning period, there are cargo demand and loaded container demand between any two CDCs needing transport. The cargo loading time or unloading time (e.g., one or several hours) is usually long compared to the container attaching/detaching time (e.g., several minutes). By the end of 2016, SDHLG takes the CDC in JNA as the depot for holding tractors. The CDC in JNA is also used as the container pool for balancing empty container flow on the transport network. Affected by the logistics function and the operating area, each CDC can keep a certain number of containers. The excess empty containers of a CDC should be transported to the container pool in the planning period. We have attained the data on CDC location, transport distance, demand between CDCs, etc. In the case study, it is assumed that: i) Any CDC can be regarded as the depot of the G-RRVRP. The realistic instances are distinguished by the depot location. Each realistic instance involves 96 vertexes. There are 15 containers of cargo demand and 25 loaded-containers demand included in each realistic instance; ii) In a realistic instance, the depot and the container pool of the G-RRVRP have the same spatial location; iii) For an instance, one CDC is chosen as the depot, and the depots of all other instances are regarded as customer locations. We design 23 instances that have different location of the depot. iv) By adding virtual vertexes of a CDC, a customer vertex only has loaded container demand, or only has cargo demand. We supplement some necessary data involved in the G-RRVRP model according to methods used by our computational experiments. Parameters of the fuel consumption coefficients are the same as those used in computational experiments in Section 4. According to SDHLG's practices, the penalty cost of a tractor waiting for a unit of time at CDCs is 2.75 (L/h). The planning period is 48 h, the maximum working time of each tractor (allocated with two drivers) in a planning period is 32 h, and the loading or unloading time for a container is 2 h. 5.2 Case computational results Our computational experiments on various scale instances imply that the two-stage heuristic needs instance-related iteration settings. Through computational trials, we let the iteration number of the modified CW algorithm and the iteration number of the local search equal to 1000 and 100,000, respectively. Table 13 shows the computational results provided by the two-stage heuristic for the 23 realistic instances. Column 1 shows the realistic-size instance. Column 2 indicates the depot location (and the container pool location) of each instance. Columns 3 and 4 give the results of the initial solution, i.e., the objective value (denoted as ObjCW) in Column 3 and the number of used tractors (denoted as KCW) in Column 4. Columns 5\u20137 indicate the results of the two-stage heuristic, i.e., the objective value (denoted as ObjCW+LS) in Column 5, the number of used tractors (denoted as KCW+LS) in Column 6 and the computation time in seconds (denoted as TCW+LS) in Column 7. Column 8 gives the fuel consumption per used tractors. Column 9 gives the percentage gap between the values of the initial solution and that of the final solution (i.e., Gap1). Balancing the computation time and the solution quality, the computation time of the two-stage heuristic for any one of the 23 instances is controlled in 70 s. Of the 23 instances, the average Gap1 is 36.3%. The computational results of realistic instances show that the two-stage heuristic can solve efficiently realistic-size instances of the G-RRVRP. The case study results are certainly affected by the estimated values of some parameters involved in the G-RRVRP model. We try to summarize some specific conclusions as follows. (i) Through relaxing some assumptions of the RRVRP, the G-RRVRP model aims to the synchronous scheduling of loaded and empty containers by respecting loading/unloading time so as to ensure the timeliness of transport service for cargo demand and loaded container demand. We put forward the mathematical formulation for the G-RRVRP and provide a constructive heuristic combined with the local search phase. The case study shows that the G-RRVRP model can capture the majority of the operating features of the tractor and container combinations employed by the example company. The heuristic, which can provide quickly satisfactory solutions for the example company, is adaptable and very easy to understand and implement. (ii) The instance design method implies that each of the 23 realistic instances has the same demand and the different depot (and container pool) location. For the 23 realistic instances, the best objective values (unit: L) vary from 3776.0 to 5077.0, and the numbers of used tractors vary from 14 to 21. It is shown that the satisfactory solution varies when the depot (and the container pool) have different locations although the demand on the network is the same. Besides, the heuristic solutions for several instances have the same number of used tractors and the different objective values. For example, in the heuristic results, the instances PI-10, PI-14 and PI-15 use 14 tractors to serve the demand, respectively. The objective values of the three instances vary from 3776.0 to 4333.5. Escobar et al. (2013) and Hashemi Doulabi and Seifi (2013) stated that the transportation costs are influenced by the depot location and vice versa. The results of the case study show that the depot location indeed affects the running cost of tractor routes. (iii) For the present customer demand distribution, SDHLG uses the CDC in JNA as the depot and the container pool. However, the CDC in JNA is not the most satisfactory location of the depot. From the results of the PI-1, and that of PI-8, PI-13 or PI-15 instances, if taking the CDC in GR, WF or TA as the depot, the total running cost of used tractors will decrease by 0.7%, 3.6% or 5.6%. 6 Conclusion The existing situations that waste collection enterprises may face vary, so researchers are striving to find more suitable ways to tackle different scenarios for the RRVRP. To make some assumptions of the RRVRP to be more practical and to generalize the situations of the RRVRP, we present a variant called the G-RRVRP. The G-RRVRP takes the waste collection management and the intercity linehaul system as the practical backgrounds. The objective of the G-RRVRP is to determine the tractor routes to minimize the total running cost of tractors in the planning period. The transport network of the G-RRVRP involves a depot, a container pool and a number of customers. Customer demand including time windows is classified into two types: loaded container demand, and cargo demand that needs empty container provision at the beginning. The container loading or container unloading time is specially considered. The loaded or empty container flow is generalized to exist between any two vertexes except the depot. On condition of respecting container loading/unloading time and customer time windows, the G-RRVRP can provide tractor routes for the synchronous scheduling of loaded and empty containers so as to ensure the timeliness of transport service. A mixed integer linear programming model for the G-RRVRP is proposed. The Benders decomposition algorithm involving Pareto-optimal cuts and a two-stage heuristic involving the savings algorithm combined with a local search phase are used to solve the G-RRVRP. The mathematical model and the two-stage heuristic are tested by using 40 small-scale instances and 20 benchmark instances. Small-scale instances can be solved directly by CPLEX through the Benders decomposition strategies to find exact solutions. The results of small-scale instances and benchmark instances suggest that the proposed formulation and the heuristic are effective. The case study shows the applicability of the G-RRVRP model and the two-stage heuristic to real-life problems abstracted from intercity linehaul systems. The heuristic presents the advantages to be adaptable, robust and easy to implement. For future research, some extensions of the G-RRVRP by including, e.g., multi-depots and open routes, are expected. Besides, more effective heuristics for the G-RRVRP are expected.

Each used-tractor begins and ends its route at the depot. Customer demand includes emptying a full container, ordering an empty container or changing a container. The objective is to find tractor routes that feature the minimum amount of total nonproductive time. In the literature the RRVRP is formulated as the node routing problem, and the \u201ctrip\u201d definition that is the complete transport service of a container is used. To relax some assumptions of the RRVRP to cater to practical desires, we present a variant called the generalized RRVRP (G-RRVRP). The G-RRVRP generalizes the practical background, the objective function and the demand flow, and considers specially container loading and unloading time constraints. The G-RRVRP classifies demand into loaded-container demand and cargo demand with time windows. On condition of respecting container loading/unloading time and customer time windows, the G-RRVRP can design tractor routes for the synchronous scheduling of loaded and empty containers so as to ensure the timeliness of transport service. The G-RRVRP aims to minimize the total running cost of used tractors, instead of the total nonproductive time of tractors adopted by the RRVRP. A mixed integer linear programming model for the G-RRVRP is proposed. The Benders decomposition algorithm involving Pareto-optimal cuts and Benders decomposition-callback implementation, and a two-stage heuristic involving the savings algorithm followed by a local search phase are provided. The mathematical formulation and the two-stage heuristic are tested by solving 40 small-scale instances and 20 benchmark instances. Small-scale instances can be solved directly by CPLEX through the Benders decomposition strategies to find exact solutions. The case study indicates the applicability of the G-RRVRP model and the two-stage heuristic to realistic-size problems abstracted from intercity linehaul systems. The computational experiments and case study indicate that the heuristic can solve various instances of the G-RRVRP such that the solution quality and the computation time are acceptable.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2018-07-31", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191261517311177", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Li, Hongqi"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Jian, Xiaorong"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chang, Xinyu"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Lu, Yingrong"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191261517311177"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261517311177"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0191-2615(17)31117-7", "prism:volume": "113", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier Ltd.", "dc:title": "The generalized rollon-rolloff vehicle routing problem and savings-based algorithm", "prism:copyright": "\u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
