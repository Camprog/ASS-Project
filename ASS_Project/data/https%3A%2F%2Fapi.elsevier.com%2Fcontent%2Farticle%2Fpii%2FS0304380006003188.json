Fig. 2 Spatial distribution of lesser kestrel RDI (relative density index) in a 384km2 Spanish farmland during summer of 2002. Coordinate X: longitude in UTM (in km). Coordinate Y: latitude in UTM (in km). Fig. 3 Spatial correlogram of Moran's I for lesser kestrel mean abundance in a 38,400ha Spanish farmland during summer of 2002. The abscissa is lag distance classes and the ordinate Moran's I coefficients, which ranges approximately from +1 (aggregated distribution) to \u22121 (regular distribution). Black circles represent significant values at the probability level after sequential Bonferroni correction (here P <0.01), and open circles insignificant values. Fig. 4 Mean partial effect of: (a) distance to the nearest roost of lesser kestrel and (b) distance to the nearest colony with more of 10 breeding pairs on lesser kestrel abundance during the summer of 2002. Broken lines indicate the SE of the mean. The rugplot on the x-axis indicates the density of data points. Fig. 5 Spatial correlogram of Moran's I for residuals from the GLM models: (a) before and (b) after adding autocovariate to explain lesser kestrel abundance in a 384km2 Spanish farmland during summer of 2002. Black circles represent significant values at the probability level after sequential Bonferroni correction (here P <0.01), and open circles insignificant values. Fig. 6 Independent and joint contributions of each explanatory variable for lesser kestrel abundance at each spatial extent considered for the study: (a) whole 16km2 square (namely, landscape extent), (b) area included within strips 500m wide at each side of the routes for censusing kestrels (patch extent) and (c) area included within strips 250m wide (plot extent). Note: Negative joint contribution of one variable indicates that the other variables act as suppressor on the particular variable (Chevan and Sutherland, 1991). Fig. 7 Overview of the steps of our modelling procedure, which may be applied to other modelling context where spatial data are used.

Madrid 44, E-34071 Palencia, Spain. Abstract In modelling spatial distribution of species, ignoring spatial autocorrelation (SA) and multicollinearity may lead to false ecological conclusions. Here we take into account both issues for examining and modelling the spatial pattern of abundance of the globally threatened lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) during summer in a 38,400ha area of northwestern Spain where large premigratory aggregations of the species occur. Spatial pattern was examined using Moran's correlogram, and models were built including geographical coordinates and autocovariate terms (which account for SA) in generalized linear models (GLM) and hierarchical partitioning (HP) models. HP models allow to alleviate multicollinearity. A grid-based approach was used by dividing the study area in 24 contiguous 4km\u00d74km squares where birds were counted in 2\u20133 visits per square (response variable). Environmental coarse-grained variables were extracted from a geographic information system (GIS) at three spatial extents. Moran's correlogram showed that lesser kestrel mean abundance per square was spatially autocorrelated up to 4\u20138km. The results from both GLM and HP analyses were roughly compatible. The GLM models explained 80.0% of the variation in kestrel abundance and were the same at the three spatial extents. Lesser Kestrel abundance was not significantly explained by landscape variables, but was negatively related to both the distance to the nearest communal roost and distance to the nearest breeding colony with more of 10 breeding pairs of lesser kestrel. An autocovariate term added later in the GLM models improved both their explanatory power (from 74.5 to 80.0%) and model residuals, which were not longer spatially autocorrelated, fulfilling thus the statistical assumption of independent errors. Findings suggest that the spatial distribution of abundance of summering lesser kestrel is, at least, partially driven by endogenous causes, such as conspecific attraction. Exogenous causes such as finer-scale variables (e.g. type of crops and food available) are yet likely needed for lesser kestrel-environment relationships. Keywords Environment\u2013species relationships Lesser kestrel Falco naumanni Generalized linear models Hierarchical partitioning Spatial autocorrelation Moran's I Geographic information system 1 Introduction Modelling environment\u2013species relationships is one of the main goals in ecological research (Rushton et al., 2004). Studies modelling the spatial distributions of the species (e.g. Bustamante, 1997; Su\u00e1rez-Seoane et al., 2002; Gibson et al., 2004a; Franco and Sutherland, 2004) have rapidly increased in recent years with the development of geographical information system (GIS) software and new powerful statistical techniques. GIS tools allow to use large digital cartographic databases and to extract easily potential predictor variables. Powerful statistical techniques, such as multiple regression methods (e.g. generalized linear models [GLM] and generalized additive models [GAM]), allow to identify factors explaining the response variable and to develop predictive models (see Guisan and Zimmermann, 2000). Despite their power, troubles of robustness of models developed using multiple regression techniques have been detected in the presence of multicollinearity between the predictor variables (i.e. that independent variables are correlated; see Mac Nally, 2000; Graham, 2003). Multicollinearity is frequently observed in nature and variables explaining better statistically may be retained in the model, while the important ecological variables are eliminated (Graham, 2003). Therefore, ecological studies that used multiple regressions in presence of multicollinearity may have yielded incorrect ecological conclusions whether multicollinearity was ignored. To solve problems due to multicollinearity, some techniques such as residual/sequential regression, principal component regression, structural equation modelling (Graham, 2003), analysis of variance inflation factor (VIF; Quinn and Keough, 2002), and hierarchical partitioning (HP; Mac Nally, 2002) are used. The use of HP is increasing in ecology and conservation as a complementary technique of modelling processes (see Gibson et al., 2004a; Gibson et al., 2004b; Radford and Bennett, 2004; Heikkinen et al., 2004; Heikkinen et al., 2005), as it allows to identify the independent and shared contributions of explanatory variables to a response, while alleviating multicollinearity (Mac Nally, 2002). Spatial autocorrelation can be other statistical trouble when modelling species distribution and it has been well established in the ecology literature (Legendre, 1993; Diniz-Filho et al., 2003; Legendre et al., 2004; Keitt et al., 2002). The classical statistical methods used to analyze environment\u2013species relationships assume the sample values of the response and explanatory variables to be statistically independent. However, the observations are commonly spatially dependent (spatial autocorrelation; Legendre and Legendre, 1998; Keitt et al., 2002), i.e., the values of the variable in neighbouring locations may be more similar or less similar than expected for locations randomly distributed (Legendre and Legendre, 1998). Thus, models that ignore the spatial dependence in ecological data may be inappropriate because they might have overestimated the importance of covariates (e.g., environmental variables; Lichstein et al., 2002; Ferrer-Cast\u00e1n and Vetaas, 2005), and have included variables that have little or no relevance on the response variable (Overmars et al., 2003; Keitt et al., 2002; Betts et al., 2006) creating false ecological conclusions (Legendre and Legendre, 1998). To solve this problem, different statistical methods have been applied to control or incorporate its spatial effects when modelling environment\u2013species relationships (Lichstein et al., 2002; Keitt et al., 2002; Ferrer-Cast\u00e1n and Vetaas, 2005). One of these alternatives is to incorporate spatial terms in the model, such as the geographical coordinate of the sample locations together with their interactions and an autocovariate term, which takes into account for spatial effects of neighboring locations of the response variable (e.g. Augustin et al., 1996; Hubbell et al., 2001; Seoane et al., 2003; Heikkinen et al., 2005). On the other hand, the spatial autocorrelation can provide us information on spatial structure of the variables by using geostatistical methods, such as the commonly used Moran's Index (I; Legendre and Legendre, 1998). This index describes and quantifies the similarity among locations as a function of distance (Legendre and Legendre, 1998) allowing to explore the distance (lag) at which the values of a given variable are spatially autocorrelated by taking into account the spatial location of the data (e.g. Cushman and McGarigal, 2002). In the modelling processes of species distribution, Gibson et al. (2004a) suggested to develop and to combine models obtained at two spatial levels (landscape and site levels). In the first level, a spatially explicit model is developed using predictor landscape variables extracted from a GIS, while in the second level models are based on finer-scale habitat variables measured on-ground, which are difficult to obtain due to the time and cost to measure them (see Austin, 2002). Because landscape variables are also likely to be indirectly related with causal variables, models developed at landscape level are most likely to be used for conservation planning (Gibson et al., 2004a). In this paper we examined the spatial pattern of lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) abundance and modelled its distribution using environmental factors measured at landscape level. Our study species is a small falcon breeding in the Palaearctic and wintering mainly in Africa (Siegfried and Skead, 1971; Cramp and Simmons, 1980). This species is considered to be a globally threatened species listed as Vulnerable (BirdLife International, 2004). Recent researches have showed that large aggregations of lesser kestrels occur during summer in several Spanish areas where population size attain to be several orders of magnitude larger than breeding populations, suggesting that part of these post-breeding populations coming from other areas (Urs\u00faa and Tella, 2001; Olea et al., 2004). This gregariousness likely lead to kestrel observations to be spatially autocorrelated. The areas occupied during summer by kestrels at least during 2\u20132.5 months have been suggested to be regular premigratory areas and may be playing an important role in the ecology and conservation of lesser kestrel populations (Olea et al., 2004). However, no works on environmental-kestrel associations have been carried out at these premigratory areas during summer. Here we: (1) described and analyzed spatial pattern of lesser kestrel abundance in a Spanish farmland by using a spatial autocorrelation analysis (Moran's I) and (2) modelled its abundance as a function of landscape variables extracted from GIS at different spatial extents by using two statistical techniques (GLM and HP) taking into account the spatial location of the data. 2 Methods 2.1 Study area Our study was conducted in a 38,400ha area in the province of Le\u00f3n, northwestern Spain (centred at 5\u00b015\u2032W 42\u00b021\u2032N; with 11.7\u00b0C annual average temperature and 486mm precipitation; see details in Olea et al., 2004; Fig. 1a). The landscape is more or less flat and open, with little amount of trees. The area is broken up by a number of small seasonal streams flowing in a north-south direction. The dominant habitat was extensive farmland, in rotation every other year (Fig. 1b). Dry cereals and ploughed fields constituted the main crops. Semi-natural grassland and mosaics of poplar groves are mainly found in the river beds. Deciduous-mixed forests are scarce and scattered. When we carried out the study, almost all the cereal cultures was harvested, remaining as stubbles and being exploited by a low grazing intensity. Ploughed fields were not sown yet. In 2002, 23 breeding pairs of lesser kestrel were documented in the study area. During summer (July, August and September) this area holds yet a large post-breeding lesser kestrel population (close to 1000 individuals; Olea et al., 2004), which gathers in communal roosts at night and disperse from these roots daily to forage (unpublished data). The area was divided into 24 contiguous UTM grid 4km\u00d74km (16km2) squares (Fig. 1b). Spatial grid system approach has been recently suggested to study bird-landscape relationships (Luoto et al., 2004; Virkkala et al., 2004) instead of using scattered study plots. The spatial grid system would allow taking into account the whole range of variation in a landscape. 2.2 Bird surveys Surveys were carried out in summer of 2002 when lesser kestrel abundance in the area peaked (i.e., during the second fortnight in August and first fortnight in September; see Olea et al., 2004). We counted birds during two or three visits (n =68 surveys) in each 16km2 square (first visit: 11 August; second visit: 16 August; third: 07 September). The potential effect of effort on lesser kestrel abundance was taken into account in the analysis (Table 1 ). To reduce bias by potential movement of kestrels among squares, all the 24 16km2 squares were censused in the same day. In each visit, a different approx. 5km lineal route was designed and covered in car at a low speed (approx. 20km/h) for censusing kestrels. Censuses by car have been considered as a reliable method to count raptors at least in open landscape (Vi\u00f1uela, 1997). Windy and rainy conditions were avoided for censusing. We count lesser kestrels localized within a strip 250m wide in each side of the itinerary. To avoid circadian rhythms of activity, kestrels were surveyed during all day (Tella et al., 1998) and previous researches showed that kestrels were active throughout the day (see Don\u00e1zar et al., 1993; Parr et al., 1997; Tella et al., 1998; Vlachos et al., 2003). To avoid counting lesser kestrel associated with roosting, we did not census during 2h after sunrise and 2h before sunset (see Olea et al., 2004). To identify kestrels, we used binoculars and spotting scope. We used the index of relative density (IRD, no. of lesser kestrels in 1km of driven transect; Vi\u00f1uela, 1997) for each grid and each visit. Then, the averages of IRD of the visits performed per square were calculated for each grid. 2.3 Environmental data Because we aim to look at the spatial extent at which landscape variables could potentially to influence the distribution of kestrel abundance across the study area, habitat predictor variables were measured at three spatial extents: (1) considering the whole 16km2 square (hereafter, landscape extent), (2) considering the area included within strips 500m wide at each side of the routes for censusing kestrels (hereafter, patch extent), and (3) considering the area included within strips 250m wide (hereafter, plot extent). The cover area by car surveys for censusing kestrels relative to the 16km2 square was on average of 64.3% (S.D.: 7.3) and 37.4% (S.D.: 5.4) for the spatial extent of 500 and 250m wide, respectively. Habitat variables associated with each extent in each 16km2 square were obtained with a GIS software, using ARCGIS 8.0 (Environmental Systems Research Institute Inc.). Four variables of broad-scale habitat cover (see Table 1): farmland (FARML), grassland (GRASSL), woodland (FOREST) and build-up areas (BUILD-UP) were estimated as the surface relative to the total area of each extent in each square from a digital land-use layer obtained from georeferenced aerial photographs (0.7m pixel resolution). Based on habitat cover variables, two landscape structure variables were calculated, namely habitat edge density (EDGE; total edge length of all habitat patches per km2, see Table 1) and landscape heterogeneity (HETER; habitat diversity using Shannon's diversity index; Heikkinen et al., 2004, see Table 1). Kestrels may select perches as look-out posts (Aparicio, 1990; personal observations) and to be also easier detectable when perching than as posed in the ground, so other explicatory variable, such as total length of electrical wires (WIRE, see Table 1), was considered. It was measured from a digital cartographic map, and this information was corroborated with field observations. Since distribution of both breeding colonies and communal roosts of lesser kestrel may potentially influence lesser kestrel abundance (see Olea et al., 2004), breeding colonies and communal roosts of kestrels within and outside from the study area were mapped. Based on this information, four raster layers, \u201cdistance to the nearest roost\u201d (DROOST), \u201cdistance to the nearest colony\u201d (DCOLONY), \u201cdistance to the nearest colony with more than five breeding pairs\u201d (DCOLONY5), and \u201cdistance to the nearest colony with more than 10 breeding pairs\u201d (DCOLONY10) from the centre of each grid square were generated (see Table 1). In the study area and its surroundings, the biggest lesser kestrel colony had 15 breeding pairs. 2.4 Statistical analysis To evaluate the spatial pattern of kestrel abundance, we examine the spatial autocorrelation by using the Moran's index (I) as a function of spatial distance (see Legendre and Legendre, 1998; Sawada, 1999). This index indicates the degree of similarity/dissimilarity between the values of the variable considered and ranges approximately from +1 (aggregated distribution) to \u22121 (regular distribution). Values of I are approximately equal to zero (\u22121/[no. of squares\u22121]) when arrangement is random. We calculated values of I for the kestrel abundance for five intersample lag distances, each of 4km extent (i.e., equivalent to a square in our study). Correlograms plot the Moran's I coefficients against distances between localities (Legendre and Fortin, 1989). Absence of spatial autocorrelation can be identified when the line is close to zero (i.e., sampling data are spatially independent). To test the significance of these Moran's coefficients for each lag distance, 9999 Monte Carlo permutations of the original data were performed and its P-values were calculated (Sawada, 1999; Heikkinen et al., 2004). The Moran's correlogram as a whole is considered significant if at least one of its coefficients is significant at the probability level after progressive Bonferroni correction (here P \u22640.01). Moran's I statistics and correlogram were computed using the program ROOKCASE (Sawada, 1999). Lesser kestrel abundance was log-transformed (ln[x+0.5]) to reach normal distribution being thus modelled using GLM with a Gaussian error and a function identity link in the program S-PLUS 2000 (Mathsoft, 2000). Transformations of the independent variables (square-root, arcsin, logarithm and potential, depending of the case) were performed for improving the linearity of relationships between predictor and response variables. Out of the three highly intercorrelated variables detailing with distance to colony (r s >0.7; Table 1), we only retained for analysing the one with the highest explained variation of the lesser kestrel abundance (DCOLONY10). To avoid over-fitting and resulting biases in the multiple regression, Crawley (2002) recommends to include no more than n/3 variables at any one time in the initial model, where n is the total sample size. Accordingly, we only introduced eight variables in any one time in our 24-cases model. Variables were tested for non-linear relationships (i.e., polynomial terms, up to third degree) with the response variable. Quadratic and cubic terms were fitted along with the linear effects. For each set of eight variables entered in the model, an automatic combination of forward stepwise selection and backward stepwise elimination procedures (procedure step) was used to select the best (in terms of AIC) model. The resulting model automatically obtained was then checked for significance of all the variables included by looking whether P \u22640.05 based in F-tests. As no more than eight variables were simultaneously tested, significant terms were retained in the model and tested again with the rest of variables non-tested with the significant terms (see Crawley, 2002 for a similar procedure with many explanatory variables in multiple regression). As spatial autocorrelation was found in our data set (both in the response variable and in the residuals from the models; see below), several spatial variables were included in the modelling approach to control their spatial effects (see Lichstein et al., 2002; Seoane et al., 2003; Virkkala et al., 2004; Betts et al., 2006). We added these variables in the final regression model, after all the important environmental variables were selected. On one hand, the geographical coordinates (x and y) and their linear and non-linear interactions (x 2, y 2, x 3, y 3, xy, x 2 y, xy 2) for each square were calculated. According to Legendre and Legendre (1998), we previously centered x and y on their respective means and standardized them to unit variance. Each one of these terms was considered as a spatial variable. We develop also a spatial autocovariate term (see Augustin et al., 1996; Keitt et al., 2002), which allows us to measure the spatial autocorrelation in the response variable (lesser kestrel abundance in our case). As spatial autocorrelation was no longer significant between 4 and 8km (see later), we developed two autocovariates (AUTOCV4 and AUTOCV8; see Table 1). AUTOCV4 was obtained as the average of kestrel IRD in the eight nearest neighbouring squares of each study square (i.e., located at 4km), while AUTOCV8 was obtained from values of the squares within a distance of 8km. For the squares at the edges of the study area, the average was calculated from available neighbouring squares. We checked the assumption of independent errors by examining Moran's correlograms of residuals of the models with and without spatial variables. Because generalized linear models can be seriously affected by (multi)collinearity between the explanatory variables (i.e., correlation among them; see Graham, 2003), we use HP procedure. HP reduces collinearity problems by determining the independent contribution that each explanatory variable has on the response variable and separates it from the conjoint contribution, resulting from correlation with other variables. The method of fitting the model to data was by least squares (i.e., the goodness-of-fit measures were calculated by R 2; see Walsh and Mac Nally, 2004). The variables explaining a significant proportion of independent variance in the response variable was tested by 500 randomizations (see Mac Nally, 2002). HP was performed using the \u201chiert.part package\u201d Version 1.0 (Walsh and Mac Nally, 2004), which was run in the R statistical software (R Version 2.0.1; a programming environment for data analysis and graphics). This HP Version allows running models with a maximum number of 12 predictor variables. Yet, due to the loss of robustness of this HP software when entering more than nine predictor variables (Olea, 2006), we only used nine variables: the spatial variable, AUTCOV4, plus those eight out of the nine linear environmental variables used in the GLM that more individual variation explained of the response variable (Table 4). Because proportions of habitat cover are not completely independent each other (so called unit sum constraint problem; sensu Aebischer et al., 1993), the four variables of habitat cover were transformed to pairwise log-ratios (see Aebischer et al., 1993; Virkkala et al., 2004). However, final GLM models remained the same whether the log-ratios (P-value=0.14\u20130.92) or the variables non-transformed (see below) were considered. As log-ratios in HP would have not a simple interpretation and also it already control for multicollinearity (Mac Nally, 2002), we did not use the log-ratio transformation for habitat cover variables further (see Heikkinen et al., 2004, 2005). 3 Results 3.1 General results The lesser kestrel mean abundance per square in the study area ranged from 0 to 2.3 per 16km2 grid square (0.83 kestrels km\u22121 on average). The spatial distribution of lesser kestrel abundance in the study area is shown in the Fig. 2 . The mean, standard deviation and range of the explanatory variables at each spatial extent (landscape, patch and plot extents) are shown in Table 2 . The dominant habitat cover variable was farmland; on average, it represented 91%, 87% and 83% of the prospected surface at each spatial extent, respectively. 3.2 Spatial autocorrelation The Moran's correlogram of lesser kestrel abundance as a whole was significant (P =0.01), due to the statistically significant positive autocorrelation of kestrel abundance for the first lag class (i.e., at 4km; Moran's I =0.31; P =0.01), but not for the other distances (8, 12, 16 and 20km). This correlogram showed a monotonic decline in the Moran's I values of spatial autocorrelation for lesser kestrel abundance (Fig. 3 ). 3.3 Model selection The GLM models explaining kestrel abundance were the same at the three spatial extents (landscape, patch and plot extents). From the spatial variables added later, only AUTOCV4 improved this GLM model (from 74.5 to 80.0%). The final model explained 80.0% of the variation in the kestrel abundance (total deviance change 4.18 out of 5.23; Table 3 ). Three explanatory variables, AUTOCV4, DROOST, and DCOLONY103 were included significantly in the model (Table 3), explaining 42.2, 14.9 and 30.3% of the explained by the model, respectively. The coefficients of the variables indicate that the DROOST and DCOLONY103 were negatively associated with kestrel abundance (Fig. 4 ), while AUTOCV4 was positively associated (Table 3). DROOST had a decreasing monotonic relation with kestrel abundance, while DCOLONY103 had a parabolic relation that decreased markedly from approx. 10km (Fig. 4). Residuals from the model before adding spatial variables showed a spatial pattern and were significantly autocorrelated at the third and fifth lag distances (i.e., at 12 and 20km, respectively; Fig. 5a), while model residuals after controlling for spatial effects did not show a significant spatial pattern (Fig. 5b). The independent and joint contribution percentages of each predictor variables for kestrel abundance estimated in HP analysis are shown in Fig. 6 . The four variables with the highest independent contribution percentages were AUTOCV4 (24.9, 25.4, 27.7% at the landscape, patch and plot extents, respectively), DROOST (8.8, 7.5, 9.0%), FARML (7.8, 12.3, 13.0%) and DCOLONY10 (6.5, 6.3, 6.7%). However, the AUTOCV4 variable was the only variable with a significant explanatory power for the kestrel abundance at the three spatial extents (landscape, patch, and plot; Table 4 ). 4 Discussion Lesser kestrel mean abundance in the 24 contiguous 16km2 squares was significantly spatially autocorrelated, which was due to a significant spatial autocorrelation in the first distance class (i.e., 4km), as indicated by Moran's correlogram (Fig. 3). This correlogram profile fit to one of the three basic types of profiles found in ecological data (Diniz-Filho et al., 2003), indicating that lesser kestrel abundance would be spatially structured in patches (i.e., the spatial pattern of kestrel abundance was aggregated). If a significant positive autocorrelation is found in the first distance class but not in the second class (as in our case), Diniz-Filho and Telles (2002) indicated that the average patch size in the variable would be between first and second upper limits of the distance classes. Therefore, in our study the average patch diameter in lesser kestrel abundance would be between 4 and 8km (first and second distant class, Fig. 3), and consequently this diameter would be the minimum distance among observations to obtain values of lesser kestrel abundance spatially independent in our study system (see Diniz-Filho and Telles, 2002; Diniz-Filho et al., 2003). Data spatially dependent (as in our case) have been discussed as a statistical problem in the model development (Lichstein et al., 2002; Overmars et al., 2003; Diniz-Filho et al., 2003). When assumption of independence is not fulfilled for spatial dependence, Legendre (1993) suggested to incorporate the spatial structure into modelling approach. When spatial autocorrelation in the response variable is thought to result from endogenous population processes (e.g. the lesser kestrel gregariousness observed in the period studied), an autocovariate term can be added into models (see Augustin et al., 1996; Heikkinen et al., 2005; Betts et al., 2006). After adding autocovariate variable (namely AUTOCV4) in our GLM models, their explanatory power was improved. This improvement is due to the fact that the autocovariate variable takes into account for spatial effects of neighboring locations of the response variable (Hubbell et al., 2001), which in our case were spatially autocorrelated at neighboring squares (i.e., 4km; see above). Much of the spatial autocorrelation of the response variable (at least at shortest distances) was longer explained by the covariables (DROOST and DCOLONY10; Fig. 5a), as indicated by model residuals being close to zero values for the first and second lags (i.e., at 4 and 8km, respectively; Fig. 5a). However after incorporating AUTOCOV4, residuals from the model improved, as were not longer significantly spatially autocorrelated (Fig. 5b), and thus it was not violated the assumption of independence of errors in the statistical models. The results of hierarchical partitioning were consistent between the three models at different spatial extents. Autocovariate variable was the only significant variable selected from the set of 9 predictor variables to explain the variance of kestrel abundance. This does not agree in principle with our results of the GLM approach, in which other two variables (DCOLONY103 and DROOST) together with the AUTOCV4, were selected by GLM models. However, we did not include the cubic term of DCOLONY10 in hierarchical partitioning analysis due to dependency of this technique on monotonic relationships between the response and explanatory variables (Heikkinen et al., 2004; Heikkinen et al., 2005) and none of the linear terms (except AUTOCOV4) without being joined with polynomial terms, explained significantly the variability of kestrel abundance in the GLM models. Therefore results from GLM and HP seem to be roughly compatible. The final GLM models explaining lesser kestrel abundance were the same at the three spatial extents (landscape, patch and plot extents). The negative association between kestrel abundance and DROOST at all spatial extents can be owed to the fact that kestrels use these sites for roosting each night (see Olea et al., 2004, unpublished data), suggesting that kestrels tend to foraging around roost sites and thus roosts might structure distribution of kestrels in the studied period. This agrees with Hamilton's refuging theory, which states that animals would use a roost as a central place within the area of food supply and disperse from this roost daily to forage (Hamilton et al., 1967; Hamilton and Watt, 1970). The negative association between kestrel abundance and DCOLONY10 at all spatial extents might be owed to the fact that part of the lesser kestrel population is formed of the local breeding kestrel population and consequently might forage near their colonies. This fact is supported by both the sightings of several pairs of lesser kestrel breeding up to later August in our study area (unpublished data) and by that found by Bustamante and Negro (1994), who observed post-breeding individuals at the colonies during summer in the southern Spain. The fact that much of the spatial autocorrelation of the lesser kestrel abundance was explained by only covariates related with distance to colony and roost, and that the AUTOCV4 substantially improved the models, suggests that the spatial distribution of lesser kestrel found is likely to be resulted from (or to be partially influenced by) endogenous factors in lesser kestrel (social factors, behaviour) such as conspecific attraction (see Augustin et al., 1996; Beauchamp et al., 1997; Keitt et al., 2002, Lichstein et al., 2002). Indeed, lesser kestrel has been showed to use conspecific attraction for selecting breeding colony in both its first and subsequent reproductive times (Serrano et al., 2001; Serrano et al., 2004). Other variables were no significantly selected by the models (GLMs and hierarchical partitioning). Pribil and Picman (1997) argued that different environmental variables can influence habitat use of birds at different scales. Accordingly, the environmental variables considered in our study might influence on kestrel abundance at a larger or smaller spatial scale than the one considered in our study. Moreover, other three possible causes not mutually excluding might explain why landscape variables were not selected in our analysis: (a) these variables had not sufficient variability to explain spatial kestrel abundance (Virkkala et al., 2004), despite the large prospect surface (38,400ha), (b) the landscape variables considered in our analysis might be not selected by kestrels during the postfledging period, and (c) the possible environmental variables affecting the lesser kestrel abundance were no considered in our study; these environmental variables may be coarse-grained landscape variables (e.g. index of plant productivity) as well as fine-scale variables measured on-ground (i.e. the causal environmental variables such as type of crops; see Legendre, 1993). In many cases, these causal variables are very difficult to know and measure (e.g. food available; see Austin, 2002). Some recent works have modelled species\u2018 distribution without considering spatial autocorrelation in their data (e.g. in bird species: Gibson et al., 2004a; Seoane et al., 2004a; Seoane et al., 2004b; in mammal species: Posillico et al., 2004; Gibson et al., 2004b; Gibson et al., 2004c; in fish species: Pont et al., 2005; in shrub species: Beck et al., 2005). Other works considered spatial autocorrelation by including spatial coordinates (e.g. Bustamante and Seoane, 2004) or an autocovariate term (e.g. Seoane et al., 2003; Sanderson et al., 2005) in the models but without examining later their effectiveness by looking model residuals. Our study suggest that works on modelling of species\u2018 distribution would benefit whether the spatial pattern of the response variable as well as of the residuals from the obtained models is taken into account, as it would allow to improve the statistical models and the understanding of the species ecology. Also, the combined use of GLM and HP can provide firmer conclusions on species-environment relationships, while alleviating (multi)collinearity. Our approach may be applied in other modelling context where spatial data are used by following the steps in Fig. 7 . It could be the case of recent studies on habitat selection (Oppel et al., 2004; Anderson et al., 2005), nesting habitat (Garc\u00eda-Ripoll\u00e9s et al., 2005), foraging habitat (Franco and Sutherland, 2004); feeding response (Gavashelishvili and McGrady, 2006), damage of forests (Bo\u017ei\u0107 et al., 2006), aquatic plant richness (Edvardsen and \u00d8kland, 2006), shifts in the vegetation occurrence (Tan and Beklioglu, 2005), or land use change (Aspinall, 2004). 5 Conclusion Our results showed a significant positive spatial autocorrelation in the response variable (lesser kestrel abundance) at distances between 4 and 8km, i.e. abundance values in one square were likely to be similar to that of its neighbor squares. These findings could be taken into account for future sampling strategies in works based on a spatial grid system, as the minimum distance to obtain spatially independent abundance data in our study should be of between 4 and 8km. However, sample locations so widely spaced may suppose a logistic problem to obtain a large sample size due to increased travel time. Consequently, a solution to increase sample size minimizing sample time would be to collect samples at shorter distances whether spatial autocorrelation is corrected or controlled during the modelling processes (Lichstein et al., 2002). To know more exactly the distance at which spatial autocorrelation we found actually disappears (i.e., between 4 and 8km), studies at finer scale (e.g. sampling squares distanced at 1km intervals) could be examined. The spatial autocorrelation found should also be taken into account in predictive models to explain lesser kestrel abundance, as it may improve the model power and, from a conservation viewpoint, explanatory variables important for conservation and managing might be misleading whether spatial autocorrelation is not considered (e.g. Overmars et al., 2003). The summering lesser kestrel abundance was only explained by covariates resulted from kestrel behaviour (roost and colony sites), suggesting that its spatial distribution is likely to be resulted from endogenous factors in lesser kestrel (social organization and conspecific attraction of the species) at least at the scale considered. Because environmental variables were not selected in our models to explain summering lesser kestrel abundance, models using variables measured on-ground (i.e., models at site level in accordance with Gibson et al., 2004a) need to be generated to improve our understanding of the lesser kestrel-environment associations in this phenological period. Our study suggest that the works on modelling of species-environment relationships should take into account the spatial pattern of the response variable as well as of the residuals from the obtained models. This modelling approach would allow to improve the statistical models and the understanding of the species ecology.

Here we take into account both issues for examining and modelling the spatial pattern of abundance of the globally threatened lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) during summer in a 38,400ha area of northwestern Spain where large premigratory aggregations of the species occur. Spatial pattern was examined using Moran's correlogram, and models were built including geographical coordinates and autocovariate terms (which account for SA) in generalized linear models (GLM) and hierarchical partitioning (HP) models. HP models allow to alleviate multicollinearity. A grid-based approach was used by dividing the study area in 24 contiguous 4km\u00d74km squares where birds were counted in 2\u20133 visits per square (response variable). Environmental coarse-grained variables were extracted from a geographic information system (GIS) at three spatial extents. Moran's correlogram showed that lesser kestrel mean abundance per square was spatially autocorrelated up to 4\u20138km. The results from both GLM and HP analyses were roughly compatible. The GLM models explained 80.0% of the variation in kestrel abundance and were the same at the three spatial extents. Lesser Kestrel abundance was not significantly explained by landscape variables, but was negatively related to both the distance to the nearest communal roost and distance to the nearest breeding colony with more of 10 breeding pairs of lesser kestrel. An autocovariate term added later in the GLM models improved both their explanatory power (from 74.5 to 80.0%) and model residuals, which were not longer spatially autocorrelated, fulfilling thus the statistical assumption of independent errors. Findings suggest that the spatial distribution of abundance of summering lesser kestrel is, at least, partially driven by endogenous causes, such as conspecific attraction. Exogenous causes such as finer-scale variables (e.g. type of crops and food available) are yet likely needed for lesser kestrel-environment relationships.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2007-01-10", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304380006003188", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "de Frutos, \u00c1ngel"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Olea, Pedro P."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Vera, Rub\u00e9n"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304380006003188"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380006003188"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0304-3800(06)00318-8", "prism:volume": "200", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier B.V.", "dc:title": "Analyzing and modelling spatial distribution of summering lesser kestrel: The role of spatial autocorrelation", "prism:copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.
