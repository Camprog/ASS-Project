Abstract Combining process-based and three-dimensional (3D) structural models for specific crops to functional\u2013structural plant models (FSPMs) enable ecophysiologists to investigate the interaction of single plants or plant stands with their biotic and abiotic environment in a unique way. The present study was part of a collaborative research program on the development of a FSPM for the sample plant (Hordeum vulgare L.). The emphasis of this paper is put on two main aspects. First, improved generic and flexible functions are formulated for modeling the shape of leaves and stems of graminaceous plants as organ-related triangulated surfaces, where the parameters may be directly interpreted in terms of morphological traits. The proposed functions constitute the structural model, which is amplified by topological information to a so-called architectural model. Second, we suggest a new approach to parameterize these functions based on 3D point cloud data obtained by digitization of entire plants. Since no automated technique is available to process 3D point clouds in a way appropriate for parameterization of the architectural model, the required algorithms are developed and implemented in Matlab\u00ae. Our approach comprises the following steps. First, the measured set of points is partitioned into subsets representing each organ. Each subset is then divided further to represent organ segments. Next, the centroid of each partial point cloud representing an organ segment is computed. The sequence of these centroid points describes the organ axis. By means of the architectural model for leaves and stems, triangulated surfaces are assembled from the computed organ axis points and from user-defined initial values for the various parameters in the model (e.g. maximum leaf width). Finally, the parameters in the functions describing leaf and stem surfaces are estimated by fitting computed triangulated surfaces into the related point cloud using least squares optimization. Hence, the proposed method allows the use of 3D point clouds obtained with modern 3D digitizing techniques for the parameterization of an organ-based architectural model. Keywords Plant architecture Model 3D point cloud Image processing Matlab 1 Introduction Ecophysiological modeling of plant growth and development has become an important field of research during the past decades and is increasingly seen as a powerful tool in amplifying the knowledge in fundamental plant ecology applied in forest and agricultural sciences (Fitz et al., 1996; Running and Gower, 1991; Yan et al., 2004). The main emphasis in crop growth modeling until some 10 years ago had been put on developing models relying on the description of fundamental biophysical, biochemical and physiological processes of growth and yield formation. In particular, modeling was focused on processes like radiation interception, carbon and nitrogen assimilation, or transport and partitioning of biochemical compounds between different morphological plant compartments such as roots, shoots, and seeds (for review see Jamieson et al., 1998; van Ittersum et al., 2003; Yin and van Laar, 2005). This type of models is commonly referred to as process-based models (PBMs). Plant architecture is typically addressed by such PBMs in a simplified manner, assuming a horizontally homogenous structure of plant stands for both shoot and root compartments, and accounting for heterogeneity in the vertical direction by statistical distributions of quantities like leaf area index (leaf area per unit ground area) or overall surface area index of plant organs. Similarly, the orientation of surface area elements in space is taken into account by these models in a simplified way, using statistical approximations (Monsi and Saeki, 1953; Norman and Campbell, 1989; Ross, 1981). This approach works well for natural vegetation or field crops forming nearly homogeneous canopies, but it is less appropriate for heterogeneous populations or systems in which plant architecture and geometry are of specific interest (Godin and Sinoquet, 2005; Yan et al., 2004; Yin et al., 2000). In particular, the inability of PBMs to explicitly account for the organ-related three-dimensional (3D) structure of plants and its dynamics during development is a serious drawback to an adequate and reliable description of radiation transfer, of microclimate within plant stands, and of organ-related 3D organization of physiological processes (Baldocchi et al., 2002; Chelle and Andrieu, 1998; Chelle, 2005; Godin and Sinoquet, 2005). In contrast to PBMs, another line of modeling, beginning with the formalism introduced by Lindenmayer (1968), has mainly focused on the detailed description of geometric shape and 3D orientation of plant surface elements (Prusinkiewicz and Lindenmayer, 1990). Until the mid 1990s, these models did not involve physiological regulation and thus may be considered as purely formal reconstructions of plant architecture. First attempts to join both directions also date to the mid 1990s and gave rise to the new modeling paradigm of combined functional\u2013structural plant models (FSPMs) (Godin, 2000; Siev\u00e4nen et al., 2000) or virtual plant models (Hanan, 1997; Room et al., 1996). This type of models aim at combining the strength of both structural (architectural) and process-based models, accounting for the inherent and interrelated spatiotemporal patterns of plant structures and processes during plant growth. For agricultural crops several reports have been published during the last years dealing with FSPMs under development (Drouet and Pag\u00e8s, 2003; Fournier et al., 2003; Watanabe et al., 2005; Wernecke et al., 2000; Yan et al., 2004). In establishing FSPMs, the development of approaches for modeling the formation of the 3D shape of individual plant organs and of its spatial orientation is an essential task. Additionally, model-based quantification of plant architecture will be useful for other purposes, too. Thus, architectural models allow a condensation of complex morphological patterns into a unique set of functions and related parameters and thus may be used to quantify and to compare morphological traits of different varieties or cultivars. Further, such models of canopy structure may help to interpret remote sensing data (e.g. Lewis, 1999) and, in combination with radiation transfer models, reveal new possibilities to improve radiation use efficiency of plant stands by plant breeding or by modifying cultivation techniques in the field or greenhouse. The present study was part of a collaborative research program on the development of a generic FSPM and its specification for spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) as model plant (German Research Association, projects \u2018Virtual Crops\u2019 and \u2018Virtual Crops-Barley\u2019). Here, we deal with a method developed to extract morphological traits of plant organs (i.e. a unique set of parameters) from 3D point clouds to be used as a database for an architectural plant model. In general, a quantitative description of morphological traits of canopies, plants or individual organs is difficult to achieve, because canopies are spatially and temporally variable (Norman and Campbell, 1989). In consequence, the problems of describing a specific plant architecture with a model are: (i) the application of adequate 3D measurements to acquire data on the 3D shape of plants and (ii) the specification of model parameters from acquired data. Recently, several methods have been developed to measure the 3D surface structure of entire objects non-destructively, like laser scanning triangulation, digital stereo photogrammetry, X-ray computed tomography or phase-shifting projected fringe profilometry with some adaptation towards quantification and visualization of 3D plant structures (Hanan et al., 2004; Kaminuma et al., 2004; Krijger et al., 1999; Pan et al., 2004; Stuppy et al., 2003). Such approaches represent non-invasive imaging techniques for capturing a set of points in 3D space (point cloud) for an investigated object. Several researchers proposed methods for automatic assignment of data to defined objects (data segmentation) and for the extraction of geometric features from 3D point clouds (Huang and Menq, 2001; Kobbelt and Botsch, 2000; Woo et al., 2002). However, their focus was on technical objects (e.g. golf clubs). Kaminuma et al. (2004) applied a laser range finder to quantify morphological traits of Arabidopsis plantlets limited in size to a few centimeters. They also developed an algorithm for automatic organ detection and subsequent surface triangulation using most, but not all measured points. However, the adaptation of this method to point clouds of bigger cereal plants with a complex and heterogeneous architecture is challenging and imposes high demands on the digitizing technique concerning accuracy and space of measurement. Therefore, we choose an alternative approach based on calculating triangulated organ surfaces (TOS) with an architectural plant model and to fit these surfaces into the organ-related measured point cloud (OPC). The resulting set of parameters can be used to describe the morphological traits of considered plant organs. Compared to surface triangulation using measured point clouds, this method has several advantages: (i) topological information can be assigned in an unique way to each plant organ, (ii) bias points not belonging to plant organs may easily be discarded, (iii) measurement noise (e.g. frayed edges in the point cloud) less perturbs triangulation, and (iv) the number of elementary triangles is reduced so that less computer capacity is required for data storage, visualization and use of such \u2019virtual plants\u2019 in PBMs (e.g. calculation of radiation transfer). In this paper, we evaluate a new point-cloud-processing method. The algorithms required are implemented in Matlab\u00ae 7 and are available on request to the authors. On the one hand, a qualitative evaluation is given by processing sample point clouds (Figs. 1 and 2 ) obtained from barley plants measured with the Digiscan 2000 digitizer (RSI GmbH, Oberursel, Germany). On the other hand, a quantitative evaluation is performed by using defined point clouds computed with a model inversion procedure. A further quantitative evaluation of the digitizing method and of the application of the point-cloud-processing algorithm to such data will be presented at a later date. 2 Architectural plant model To model plant architecture in 3D, appropriate mathematical functions are needed to describe the spatial orientation and shape of organs. Two classes of organs are specified in the model: (i) leaf (leaf blade) and (ii) stem (representation of all nodes, internodes and leaf sheaths of each tiller). The surface of these organs is described by a set of triangles (Fig. 3 ) and is denoted as a TOS (triangulated organ surface) hereafter. To obtain the vertex coordinates of each elementary triangle, we first calculate the organ axis, which is defined as a curved line from the basal to the distal end of the organ and approximated by a sequence of n points Pa. The position of the points Pa is determined by Cartesian coordinates (x i , y i , z i ): (1) P a i = x i y i z i , Pa = ( P a 1 ,P a 2 , \u2026 ,P a n ) ( 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n ) Further, at each Pa i we compute a 1D (line) or 2D (decagon) geometric primitive (Sh i ) normal to the proximodistal organ axis at this position and with the centroid at the respective Pa i . These primitives represent the cross-sectional area of the organ at the respective Pa i normal to the organ axis. Orientation, shape and size of each Sh i are defined as follows. In a first step, the orientation of Sh i can be described by the Euler angle triplet (\u03b8 i , \u03c6 i , \u03c8 i ) as defined in computational geometry, where \u03b8 i =rotation (in radians) of Sh i around the z-axis measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis (azimuth angle), \u03c6 i =rotation (in radians) of Sh i in the x\u2013z plane measured counterclockwise from the x\u2013y plane (elevation angle) and \u03c8 i =counterclockwise rotation of Sh i around its own axis (rotation angle). The angles \u03b8 i and \u03c6 i are specified by the direction vector e i =Pa i+1 \u2212Pa i (1\u2264 i \u2264 n \u22121; e n = e n\u22121). The remaining Euler angle \u03c8 i is approximated by an appropriate mathematical function. In order to derive a function that would permit a universal application and parameterization, which allows comparing parameter values specified for organs differing in dimension and shape (e.g. due to phytomer rank, developmental stage, cultivar characteristics and growth conditions), it is useful to transform the index vector i (1,\u2026, n) to a standardized (normalized) vector s i (s 1 =0,\u2026, s n =1). This procedure is explained in Appendix A. The vector s i is denoted as relative axis position hereafter and can also be considered as a continuous variable within the domain 0\u2264 s \u2264l. As a first approximation, we propose to describe the rotation angle \u03c8 i = \u03c8(s = s i ) at the relative axis position s i by the so-called surface-twist-function: (2) \u03c8 ( s = s i ) = \u03c8 1 + \u0394 \u03c8 \u00d7 s \u00d7 1 + c \u22c5 s 1 + c ( 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n ; 0 \u2264 s \u2264 1 ; c > \u2212 1 ) which is a second order polynomial in s, written in a way such that function parameters are directly interpretable in terms of surface characteristics. The parameters are: \u03c8 1 =basal rotation angle, \u0394\u03c8 = \u03c8 n \u2013 \u03c8 1 with \u03c8 n = distal rotation angle (typical values: \u22122\u03c0\u2264 \u03c8 1, \u0394\u03c8 \u22642\u03c0; \u0394\u03c8 >0 describes a twisting of the TOS in counterclockwise and \u0394\u03c8 <0 in clockwise direction), and c =curvature parameter (typical values: \u22120.5\u2264 c \u22640.5; c <0 describes a concave and c >0 a convex parabola). As a next step after defining the orientation of Sh i , it is necessary to specify the 1D or 2D shape of Sh i for the considered organ classes leaf and stem. In the model, we define Sh i for leaves as a symmetric line and Sh i for stems as a rotation-symmetric decagon, where in both cases Pa i is the centroid of the geometric primitive. The next step comprises the specification of the size of Sh i . For leaves, we only need to estimate the length of the line describing leaf width at the relative axis position s by a leaf-width-function (b(s)). Pr\u00e9vot et al. (1991) proposed to describe the blade width of a maize leaf along its axis by a second order polynomial. However, this approach suffers from some inflexibility of the polynomial function used to describe leaf shape and from difficulties to interpret the parameters in terms of biological characteristics. Therefore, we propose an improved leaf-width-function that allows a description of leaf shape in a more flexible way. Furthermore, contrasting to the approach of Pr\u00e9vot et al., the proposed function has the advantage that the parameters can be directly interpreted in terms of morphological leaf traits: (3) b ( s = s i ) = b max b ( a + s ) ( 1 \u2212 s ) b [ ( 1 + a ) b / ( b + 1 ) ] b + 1 ( 0 \u2264 s \u2264 1 ) where b max is the maximum leaf width and a, b the curvature parameters (typical values: 0< a, b < 2). This function describes leaf width normal to the organ axis at each position s i from the organ base (s =0) to the tip (s =1). The derivation of Eq. (3) and its constraints are given in Appendix B. In contrast to leaf surfaces, we approximate the cross-sectional area of the stem Sh i at each Pa i as a rotation-symmetric decagon (centroid Pa i ). To this end, we only need to estimate the distance of decagon corner points from Pa i at each relative axis position s (or s i ). A so-called stem-radius-function (r(s)) similar to Eq. (2) with the same generic characteristics is introduced as: (4) r ( s = s i ) = r 1 + \u0394 r s 1 + d s 1 + d ( 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n ; 0 \u2264 s \u2264 1 ; d > \u2212 1 ) where r 1 is the basal radius, \u0394r the r n \u2212 r 1 with r n the apical radius, and d the curvature parameter. By means of the functions introduced above (Eqs. (1)\u2013(4)), the 3D orientation and shape of leaf and stem surfaces is specified completely. This way, the model allows to compute a set of points (axis points Pa i and corner points of a specified Sh i ) describing the organ contours along its axis. The last step comprises the interconnection of these points to elementary triangles, which form a TOS as a representation of the respective organ surface and its 3D orientation. 2.1 Point-cloud-processing algorithm 2.1.1 Segmentation of the measured point cloud As outlined in the introduction, there are some digitizing techniques, which are capable to quantify the 3D surface structure of entire plants. As an output such methods generate a set of points, denoted hereafter as a point cloud (PC), representing the shape of the plant under investigation. However, if the modeler is interested to use such a PC for the specification of the shape of individual plant organs and accounting for their topological location within the plant at the same time, the approach used should allow an assignment of subsets of points to specific organs. This procedure is called segmentation in this paper. At present no methods are available, which would allow an automated segmentation of a PC obtained by digitizing entire and complexly structured plants. Furthermore, besides providing a unique assignment of points to individual organs, the method used should allow to identify bias points, which may be introduced by applying the digitizing techniques mentioned in the introductory section. To this aim, we propose an iterative user-interactive segmentation of a PC into organ-related point clouds (OPC) as detailed below (cf. Fig. 2). The iteration step j starts with displaying a PC in a 3D plot. This figure is manually rotated by mouse interaction to get a clear visual identification of organs (e.g. no overlapping of organ contours). Assignment of points in the PC to organs is done by drawing a closed polygon around the relevant points using the Matlab\u00ae function inpolygon. Points within the polygon are removed from the PC, assigned to the organ-related point cloud OPC j and related to a specific organ by defining an identification term, which includes topological information (e.g. Ms. B2=main stem, leaf no. 2). This procedure allows to concurrently identify and discard points, which obviously do not belong to the plant. Such bias points are not considered in further computations. Iteration step j +1 starts with the reduced PC. Iterations are continued until all points in a PC are either related to organs or discarded. 2.1.2 Estimating organ axis points To calculate organ axes points Pa from each OPC j , an iterative algorithm (i =iteration step) is applied. Each iteration step requires first to identify the point in OPC j that corresponds to the most basal point (P 0) of the object. In the first iteration step (i =1), P 0 is picked by the user via mouse click from OPC j , which is displayed in a 3D plot. The algorithm picks the one closest to the mouse click. This P 0 becomes the first point of the organ axis (Pa1). Next, all points in OPC j with a distance to P 0 less than a predefined value d crit are selected. The centroid of this subset of points is calculated and taken as the next axis point Pa i+1. To catch all points between the organ edges, d crit should be bigger than half the maximum organ width. However, it should not be chosen much larger, because increasing d crit reduces the number of axis points and thus the accuracy of the computed organ axis. For the next iteration step (i+1), points in OPC j previously selected to calculate Pa i+1 are deleted. Then, the point in the remaining point cloud closest to Pa i+1 is searched and taken as the new starting point P 0 for calculating the next centroid as described above. This centroid is the next axis point Pa i+2. Note that P 0 becomes an axis point only in the first iteration. Iteration is continued until all points in OPC j have been selected and deleted. This procedure leads to a number of axis points Pa, which are used for the calculation of a TOS with the architectural model. 2.1.3 Fitting triangulated surfaces into related point clouds The proposed architectural model computes a TOS as a representation of the surface of leaves and stems and its 3D orientation. The model parameters for leaves are: (i) the axis points Pa and (ii) the parameters of the leaf-width-function b(s) i.e. b max, a and b, as well as (iii) the parameters of the leaf-twist-function \u03c8(s), namely \u03c8 1, \u0394\u03c8 and c, merged into a parameter vector Parm=(b max, a, b, \u03c8 1, \u0394\u03c8, c). Similarly, the parameters of the architectural stem model are given by: (i) the axis points Pa and (ii) the parameter vector Parm=(r 1, \u0394r, d) containing the parameters of the stem-radius-function r(s). The fitting procedure finds the optimal set of model parameters to compute a TOS such that it fits best to the related measured OPC. Therefore, the following minimization problem needs to be solved for the norm NRM, where TOS(Pa, Parm) is the surface TOS defined by the parameters Pa and Parm and OPC contains n measured points: (5) NRM = \u2211 i = 1 n min Parm ( P i OPC \u2212 P i TO S i ( Pa, Parm ) ) 2 \u21d2 Min ! The point in TOS closest to a related point P i OPC is defined by P i TOS (Pa, Parm). Hence, the optimization procedure (Eq. (5)) minimizes the geometric distance between each point in the OPC and its closest point on the TOS according to a least squares fitting approach. Note that the model parameter Pa is already established at this stage as a model parameter by a different algorithm and therefore not subject to this fitting. Further methodical aspects of applying optimization algorithms to surface fitting will not be dealt with in further detail, since they are well documented in many papers and a number of textbooks (Farin, 1993; Giordano and Hsu, 1985; Grimm et al., 2002; Lord and Wilson, 1984; Marshall et al., 2001; Weiss et al., 2002). 2.2 Test of the point-cloud-processing algorithms 2.2.1 General information In the previous section, we gave a description of a point-cloud-processing algorithm proposed to calculate a TOS, which best fits into the related OPC. In order to verify the applicability of this method, especially of the surface fitting algorithm used, we applied a model inversion procedure as outlined below. First, we generated m =1000 well-defined OPCs from a known TOS, where the latter was computed with a set of given model parameters Pain and Parmin. This way, 500 OPCs describing leaves and 500 OPCs describing stems were generated and subsequently processed with the point-cloud-processing algorithm. This procedure yields a set of re-estimated model parameters Paout and Parmout, which may be compared to Pain and Parmin. The entire procedure will be described in detail below. 2.2.2 Computation of defined point clouds In order to obtain an OPC describing differently shaped organ surfaces, related TOSs need to be calculated first with a given set of parameters Pain and Parmin. To compute Pain in each simulation, a horizontally and vertically curved line starting at the origin of the coordinate system is defined. The respective curvature is determined by second order polynomials. The values of the parameters in the polynomials are changed for each of the m =1000 simulated axes with the help of a random number generator. A number of n Pa organ axis points Pain (11\u2264 n Pa \u226421), the precise number again determined using random numbers, always spaced 1cm apart and situated on the curved axis, are calculated. The result is an organ axis 10\u201320cm long. The parameter vector Parmin includes the parameters in the functions b(s) and \u03c8(s) for leaves and parameters in r(s) for stems. As before, random numbers are used to determine the value of the parameters in b(s) within the boundaries 0cm\u2264 b max \u22642cm and 0\u2264a, b \u22642, and in \u03c8(s) within the boundaries 0\u2264 \u03c8 1, \u0394\u03c8 \u22642\u03c0 and \u22120.5\u2264 c \u22640.5. These values specify the shape of the TOS for leaves. Similarly, values for the parameters in r(s) randomly selected such that 0cm\u2264 r 1, \u0394r \u22641cm; \u22120.5\u2264 d \u22640.5 form the parameter vector Parmin for the computation of the TOS for stems. Having specified Pain and Parmin for the calculation of the TOS, we now compute a defined number of 100 points randomly distributed inside each elementary triangle of the TOS, which subsequently leads to an OPC. Finally, the point-cloud-processing algorithm introduced in the previous section is applied to fit a new TOS into the obtained OPC for each simulation considered. Lastly, this fitting leads to a new set of re-estimated architectural model parameters Paout and Parmout, which are compared to the given ones. 2.2.3 Comparison of given and re-estimated axis points To compare a given (Pain) and a re-estimated set of organ axis points (Paout), some measure of difference needs to be calculated. Here, we propose to calculate the Euclidian distance (P i ) of n Pa points Paout from the closest point in Pain: (6) P i = min | P a i out \u2212 P a in | ( 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n Pa ) In our case, P i is not the best measure of distance, since we want to compute the distance of a point P a i out from a line and not from a discrete number of points Pain. In order to obtain a numerical approximation of a line from Pain, this point sequence is extended by calculating a further 100 points between two neighboring axis points via linear interpolation leading to P a ext in . The Euclidian distance P for the jth simulation (1\u2264 j \u2264 m) averaged over n Pa is: (7) P j = 1 n Pa \u2211 i = 1 n Pa min | P a i out \u2212 P a ext in | In order to present the accuracy between Pain and Paout for the m =1000 simulated OPCs, we introduce the mean distance P mean as: (8) P mean = 1 m \u2211 j = 1 m P j Subsequently, P mean is stated together with the standard deviation of P mean. For the 1000 simulated organ surfaces, a mean value of P mean =0.0103cm\u00b10.0050cm was obtained, which means that simulated and calculated organ axes deviate approximately 0.1mm on average. This demonstrates that the introduced algorithm can be applied to calculate organ axis points from an associated point cloud with good accuracy. 2.2.4 Comparison of given and re-estimated values of Parm Recall that a least square optimization algorithm (Eq. (5)) is used to find an optimal set of parameter values. To start the optimization, an initial guess for the values in Parmout is made by multiplying the corresponding values in Parmin by a random number. The results of the comparison of given and re-estimated values of Parmout for the 1000 simulated organs are shown in Fig. 4 . Re-estimated values of model parameters (Parmout) are plotted against given ones (Parmin) and the 1:1 line is added in each plot. Linear regression is applied to the data. Regression coefficients and the systematic root mean squared error (RMSEs) and the unsystematic root mean squared error (RMSEu) are shown in each subplot. Further details concerning the specification of these errors are given by Willmott (1981) and in Appendix C. Most data fall onto or near the 1:1-line, which means that, in general, given and re-estimated model parameters are in good agreement. This is underlined by the regression analysis, which yields lines very close to the corresponding 1:1-lines and by the low values for RMSEs and RMSEu. In the leaf-width-function b(s), values for b max are re-estimated with a small error (RMSEs =0.010; RMSEu =0.024), which implies that this parameter can be determined with great accuracy by the optimization procedure. The precision of estimating the curvature parameter b is only slightly less (RMSEs =0.038; RMSEu =0.075), while it is notably lower for a (RMSEs =0.095; RMSEu =0.141). The reason for the latter lies in the nature of Eq. (3) and the constraint that a \u00d7 b \u22641. For values of b near zero, the value of a has little bearing on b(s), so that a wide range of values yields reasonable results. Hence, the optimization algorithm may produce an estimate of a quite different from the given value, which still leads to a good description of the original organ surface. The points deviating clearly from the 1:1-line are for organs where b is very small. Due to the aforementioned constraint, the probability of having a large value of a increases as the value of b decreases. Hence, the number of points deviating from the 1:1-line goes up and the parameter is underestimated as a gets bigger. With respect to the parameters in the leaf twist function \u03c8(s), the optimization algorithm re-estimates values for \u03c8 1 (RMSEs =0.007; RMSEu =0.039) and \u0394\u03c8 (RMSEs =0.063; RMSEu =0.064) with little error, but values for c only with a fairly big one (RMSEs =0.016; RMSEu =0.172). This is due to a relatively large number of outliers. They occur, if a leaf is not or only barely twisted (\u0394\u03c8 \u22480). In that case the magnitude of c has virtually no effect on \u03c8(s) (cf. Eq. (2)). As described above for the parameter a, the optimization algorithm may then come up with an estimate of c far from the given value, which still leads to an accurate description of the original organ surface. Finally, all parameters in the stem radius function r(s), i.e. r 1, \u0394r and d, are re-estimated with good accuracy (RMSEs \u22640.045; RMSEu \u22640.035). However, the systematic error is always greater than the unsystematic one and all three parameters are increasingly underestimated the bigger the given values are. The occurrence of the systematic error here can be explained as follows: the architectural model describes a stem section, which is circular in nature, with a decagon, whose corner points lie on the circle. Hence, the distance from the center of the decagon to the corner points equals the radius of the stem, while the distance to any other point on the decagon's circumference is smaller. To re-estimate the stem radius, the optimization algorithm fits a circle through the decagon, whose radius is computed as the mean distance of the points on the circumference of the decagon from its center. Since the decagon is smaller than the circular stem it approximates, the re-estimated radius is always smaller than the original one. The absolute difference between re-estimated and given radius increases, as the given radius gets bigger, while the relative difference remains the same. The problem just described is an artifact, which arises from re-estimating a circle from a decagon. It does not arise, if r 1, \u0394r and d are estimated from the original point cloud for the circular stem. The few outliers which appear in the estimate of d occur for similar reasons just described for the parameters a in b(s) and c in \u03c8(s) (cf. Eq. (4)). Due to the random generation of the values for the parameters in Parmin, some unusual organ shapes were produced, e.g. an almost rectangular leaf (b near 0 and a \u00d7 b =1), for which it is hardly possible to obtain re-estimated values (particularly for a) near the original ones. Better results can be achieved, if the parameter values are constrained such that they yield reasonable organ shapes. In spite of these difficulties and the fact that six parameters need to be optimized for leaves and three for stems, the obtained results underline the suitability of the algorithm, which was the intention of this test. The same test was performed with point clouds randomly disturbed with the measurement error specified for the digitizing device (0.01cm). The accuracy of this test is only slightly lower. 3 Discussion The architectural model introduced here extends the approach of Pr\u00e9vot et al. (1991) often used in plant models (Drouet, 2003; Fournier and Andrieu, 1998; Ozier-Lafontaine et al., 1998). The model comprises generic equations describing width and possible twisting of leaf surfaces and the radius of the stem along a normalized axis. These functions are implemented in Matlab\u00ae to compute TOSs. Since an axis normalized to one is used, our approach allows the comparison of model parameters gained from leaves of either differing leaf and tiller rank or other graminaceous species. Despite the integration of leaf twisting into our architectural model, it still remains a rough estimate, because a more detailed description of phenotypic traits, e.g. growing leaves still rolled up, leaf thickness or cross-sectional shape, is missing. However, if gravity and biomechanical properties of plant organs are considered as a cause for their morphology as stressed by Ancelin et al. (2004), Fourcaud and Lac (2003) or Zebrowski (1999), a high degree of detail and accuracy in measurements is necessary. An extension of the architectural model to include these features requires either very precisely estimated point clouds or data gathered by other methods. How detailed a model needs to be depends on the question to be addressed with it and on the scale of the investigation (e.g. whole stand or single leaf). Our architectural model, which is based on a barley cultivar, can easily be applied to phenotypically similar plants, i.e. other cereals. The adaptation of the model to deviating phenotypes of leaves in cereals as observed e.g. in maize, or to leaves of plants from other botanical families will require an adaptation of the architectural model and of the underlying algorithms to estimate model parameters. In this paper, we propose to estimate the architectural model parameters of the organ classes leaf and stem from measured 3D point clouds. Manual processing of point clouds is performed in the introduced point-cloud-processing algorithm, which slows the analysis. Approaches to an automatic extraction of geometric feature from a PC are described by Huang and Menq (2002) and Kuo and Yau (2003) for the reverse engineering of technical objects, but not yet for plants. An adaptation of these methods to the automation of point-cloud-processing is decisive for further investigations. However, measurement precision and automatic organ identification of mature and tillered cereal plants remain complicated, as stressed in the introduction. To develop an automatic point-cloud-processing algorithm for plants, point clouds of single tillers gathered with an appropriate measurement technique can serve as a basis. This avoids problems due to overlapping of organs. Since a user-defined segmentation of measured point clouds allows the elimination of bias points and the assignment of topological information, it is a sensible approach. Architectural model-based computation of triangulated organ surfaces and concomitant fitting of these surfaces into the related point clouds has several advantages compared to automatic surface triangulation with measured points: (i) possible glitches in a measured point cloud do not necessarily influence the quality of surface triangulation and (ii) model-based computation of virtual plants requires less computer resources for data storage, visualization and subsequent calculations. The application of an optimization algorithm, which finds the best fit between point cloud and triangulated organ surface, is crucial, since the influence of six (or three) parameters needs to be accounted for. The applied least-square fitting algorithm has its limits when starting with parameters far from the optimum, especially with regard to the leaf twist function \u03c8(s). Here several parameter configurations far from the optimum can produce a local minimum so that the fitting procedure does not proceed to the true optimum. However, this problem can be overcome by choosing initial parameters for \u03c8(s) not too far from the optimal solution. Since the parameters in \u03c8(s) are easily interpretable, this is not difficult. Despite the mentioned restriction, the presented point-cloud-processing algorithm can be used to parameterize the outlined architectural model for leaves and stems, based on digitized 3D point clouds. Further work will focus on the evaluation of appropriate digitizing techniques, model parameterization, and expansion of the architectural model to account for temporal changes of model parameters.

Appendix A Recall Eq. (1): (Al.l) P a i = x i y i z i , Pa = ( P a 1 , P a 2 , \u2026 , P a n ) ( 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n ) which defines a sequence of n axis points Pa. To obtain s, which states the distance of an axis point Pa i from the first axis point Pa1 relative to the distance from the point Pa1 to the last point Pa n , the distance of Pa i to Pa1 hereafter called t j , is calculated first: (A1.2) t j = \u2211 i = 2 j | P a i \u2212 P a i \u2212 1 | ( 2 \u2264 j \u2264 n ) t 1 = 0 Dividing a value t j by the value of the element t n (i.e. the organ length) then leads to: (A1.3) s j = t j t n ( 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n ) The indices of the discrete variable s i = s j are omitted and s is defined as a continuous variable within the domain 0\u2264 s \u22641 to denote the relative axis position. Appendix B An auxiliary function g(s) is introduced containing the parameters describing leaf curvature along the normalized axis s, where the parameter a determines the intersection of the curve and the ordinate, and b determines the curvature: (A2.1) g ( s ) = ( a + s ) ( 1 \u2212 s ) b ( 0 \u2264 s \u2264 1 ) Differentiation of g with respect to s yields: (A2.2) g \u2032 ( s ) = ( 1 \u2212 s ) b \u2212 ( a + s ) b ( 1 \u2212 s ) b \u2212 1 Estimating the local maximum s = s max by setting g\u2032(s)=0 and moving s = s max to the left side leads to: (A2.3) s max = 1 \u2212 a b b + 1 Replacing s in Eq. (A2.1) with s max given by Eq. (A2.3) yields: (A2.4) g ( s max ) = 1 b ( 1 + a ) b b + 1 b + 1 Dividing Eq. (A2.1) by g(s max) leads to a bi-directionally normalized function. Scaling the curve to a maximum leaf width (b max) by multiplying the result with b max yields the function used in this paper to approximate the leaf width along the normalized axis s: (A2.5) b ( s ) = b max b ( a + s ) ( 1 \u2212 s ) b [ ( 1 + a ) b / ( b + 1 ) ] b + 1 ( 0 \u2264 s \u2264 1 ) This function is defined in the domain (0\u2264 s \u22641) describing b(s) from the organ base (s =0) to the tip (s =1). The following constraints on function parameters must be observed: (i) maximum leaf width is positive (b max >0), (ii) leaf width at the base of the organ is positive, which requires that a \u22650, (iii) leaf width at the top of the organ is zero, which requires that b \u22650 (pole at the domain s =1, if b <0), and (iv) the maximum of the function is inside the stated domain, which requires that a \u00d7 b \u22641. If condition (iv) is not fulfilled, s max becomes negative (Eq. (A2.3)), leading to a misinterpretation of the parameter bmax. Appendix C The root mean squared error (RMSE) is defined as: (A3.1) RMSE = 1 n \u2211 i = 1 n ( P i \u2212 O i ) 2 where n represents the number of observations (simulations), O i the observed values (given parameter values) and P i the predicted values (re-estimated parameter values). Using linear regression analysis as measure for the goodness of a model fit between prediction and observation, RMSE can be separated into the systematic (RMSEs) and unsystematic components (RMSEu): (A3.2) RMSE = RMS E s 2 + RMS E u 2 They are defined as: (A3.3) RMS E s = 1 n \u2211 i = 1 n ( P \u02c6 i \u2212 O i ) 2 and (A3.4) RMS E u = 1 n \u2211 i = 1 n ( P \u02c6 i \u2212 P i ) 2 where P \u02c6 i = k O i + I represents the predicted values determined by linear regression, where k is the slope and I the intercept.

The present study was part of a collaborative research program on the development of a FSPM for the sample plant (Hordeum vulgare L.). The emphasis of this paper is put on two main aspects. First, improved generic and flexible functions are formulated for modeling the shape of leaves and stems of graminaceous plants as organ-related triangulated surfaces, where the parameters may be directly interpreted in terms of morphological traits. The proposed functions constitute the structural model, which is amplified by topological information to a so-called architectural model. Second, we suggest a new approach to parameterize these functions based on 3D point cloud data obtained by digitization of entire plants. Since no automated technique is available to process 3D point clouds in a way appropriate for parameterization of the architectural model, the required algorithms are developed and implemented in Matlab\u00ae. Our approach comprises the following steps. First, the measured set of points is partitioned into subsets representing each organ. Each subset is then divided further to represent organ segments. Next, the centroid of each partial point cloud representing an organ segment is computed. The sequence of these centroid points describes the organ axis. By means of the architectural model for leaves and stems, triangulated surfaces are assembled from the computed organ axis points and from user-defined initial values for the various parameters in the model (e.g. maximum leaf width). Finally, the parameters in the functions describing leaf and stem surfaces are estimated by fitting computed triangulated surfaces into the related point cloud using least squares optimization. Hence, the proposed method allows the use of 3D point clouds obtained with modern 3D digitizing techniques for the parameterization of an organ-based architectural model.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2007-01-10", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304380006003486", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dornbusch, Tino"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Wernecke, Peter"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Diepenbrock, Wulf"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304380006003486"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380006003486"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0304-3800(06)00348-6", "prism:volume": "200", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier B.V.", "dc:title": "A method to extract morphological traits of plant organs from 3D point clouds as a database for an architectural plant model", "prism:copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.
