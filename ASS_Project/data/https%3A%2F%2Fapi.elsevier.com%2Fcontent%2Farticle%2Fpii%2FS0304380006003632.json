Fig. 1 Box diagram depicting the two patches and fluxes between patches and the atmosphere. Fig. 2 Production, decomposition, and net C flux responses to soil C content within an individual patch. Two stable attractors, a high and low C content state and an unstable intermediate C content state attractor are observed. Fig. 3 Baseline simulation run. Erosion was initiated at year 50 and continues for the remaining of the simulation. Patch i is the source patch and patch j is the sink patch. Fig. 4 Histogram of final total soil C content observed in the fully factorial sensitivity analysis. The distribution of final total soil C is notably bimodal. Fig. 5 Long-term differences in soil carbon due to erosion, with the mean differences in (a) and the standard deviation among runs in (b). With increasing intensity of erosion less C is observed overall and in the individual patches, while the distribution of C becomes more skewed to the sink patch. With increasing intensity of erosion the variation overall and within patches increases. Fig. 6 Model sensitivity analysis through direct comparison of parameter effects. The magnitude of sensitivity is inversely related to the standard deviation of model output to changes in the parameter (a). Furthermore, sensitivity of the model to a parameter may be sensitive to the magnitude of the parameters. The size of the standard deviation of standard deviations (b) is an estimate of this effect. Fig. 7 Standardized residuals of multivariate regression estimate of long-term model behavior based on the suite of sensitivity analyses. The resulting equations show the relative contribution of different factors to overall variation in carbon. Total carbon is shown in (A), erosion site carbon is shown in (B), and deposition site carbon is shown in (C). Fig. 8 Change in carbon storage following erosion reduction for total carbon (a), source patch carbon (b) and sink patch carbon (c). For each of these figures three levels of erosion reduction are shown.

Abstract Unraveling the consequences of hydrologic transport on carbon (C) storage will help identify feedbacks between land management alternatives, climate change, and soil-vegetation-atmospheric-transfers (SVATs) of C. There is a need for theoretically driven models of erosion and deposition that includes transport induced mineralization to better understand the controls on SVATs of C. Here we present a model developed using a systems-dynamic approach that coupled C-SVATs at a 2-day resolution with a discrete event erosion\u2013deposition model occurring with a prescribed return interval. Five possible mass-balance transformations of C occurring between the two patches were explicitly modeled: net primary production (NPP), decomposition, erosion, transport induced mineralization, and deposition. The net C-SVAT, NPP minus decomposition, exhibited three stable points of no net C flux. Starting with arbitrary initial C pool in each patch above the bifurcation point, the model approached a quasi-steady state, which included both the short-term and longer term consequences of erosion; in the baseline simulation 5080g Cm\u22122 was stored prior to erosion and 100 years of low intensity erosion 4840g Cm\u22122 SOC remained. Low intensity erosion also generated spatial heterogeneity; from an initial homogeneous distribution to 40% of the C stored in the eroded patch and 60% of the C stored in the deposition patch. Erosion reduction resulted in a corresponding increase in total soil C content that was positively related to the magnitude of erosion reduction. In conjunction with providing a modeling framework for reducing the uncertainty in C-SVAT, this model is a prototype of a growing theory of ecosystem processes within spatially explicit landscapes, a meta-ecosystem model. Keywords Carbon sequestration Erosion Deposition Non-linear Alternate stable states 1 Introduction Spatial heterogeneity in biogeochemical cycling and connectivity between distinct landscape patches can have substantial effects on ecosystem functioning (Shaver et al., 1991; Fisher et al., 2001; McClain et al., 2003). The effect of material redistribution on biogeochemical cycling is especially contentious in regards to the effect of transport on ecosystem carbon (C) storage (Stallard, 1998; Smith et al., 2001; Lal, 2003; Liu et al., 2003). Some studies suggest increases in terrestrial C storage occur following transport as C is deposited in sites where decomposition is slower than at erosional sites. Others suggest decreases in terrestrial C storage follows erosion as material is mineralized during transport and production at the eroded sites is reduced. Resolving this controversy becomes more important with the projected increases in global precipitation variability (Easterling et al., 2000; Douville et al., 2002; Giorgi and Bi, 2005), and the expected increases in erosion associated with this variability (Nearing et al., 2004). Unraveling the consequences of hydrologic transport on C storage will help identify feedbacks between land management alternatives, climate change, and soil-vegetation-atmospheric-transfers (SVATs) of C (Jenerette and Lal, 2005). A large amount of C is transported through hydrologic mechanisms and the fate of the C is uncertain (Stallard, 1998; Lal, 2003). Globally, 0.75Pgyear\u22121 of C has been estimated to leave terrestrial soils, approximately 27% of the net flux of C into vegetation from the atmosphere (Lal, 2003). Soil erosion is a dominant mechanism for transporting terrestrial C. However, the relationship between C transport and soil erosion is complex and non-linear, which prevents a direct extrapolation of erosion studies to understanding C movement. As more erosion occurs and total suspended solid concentration increases, the %C of this material often decreases (Ludwig et al., 1996). Concurrent with increased erosional force, large aggregates are broken apart thereby reducing the physical protection from decomposition associated with soil structure (Baldock and Skjemstad, 2000; Telles et al., 2003). Coupled with the process of erosion a sizeable proportion of the transported OC may be mineralized during transport (Jacinthe and Lal, 2001; Jacinthe et al., 2002). Furthermore, the magnitude of erosion can vary substantially with the scale of analysis. In a study of the Mekong River watershed only \u223c4% of the particles eroded were exported to the river, resulting in a difference in magnitude with scale. Material that was transported to the river was C depleted compared to the redeposited locally material, resulting in a difference in quality with scale (Chaplot et al., 2005). Thus erosion can serve to enrich recipient systems of labile C, deplete source systems of labile C, and directly lead to CO2 flux to the atmosphere (Lal, 2003). However, predicting the magnitude of these changes is dependent upon rates of erosion, antecedent condition, and soil characteristics. Several modeling frameworks have been constructed to examine the transport of C between erosion and deposition sites. Sediment erosion models have been used to examine material movement between erosion and deposition sites and how soil may respond to future management and climate scenarios (Nearing et al., 1999, 2004). These models have projected increases in soil loss associated with increased frequency of high intensity precipitation events with uncertainties related to the effects on vegetation associated with increased precipitation (Pruski and Nearing, 2002). Models specifically examining C transport associated with erosion have shown substantial decreases in source site C pools due to soil movement (Harden et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2003; Polyakov and Lal, 2004). Models of C transport associated with erosion at continental to global scales have identified a potentially large C sink associated with transport of C from terrestrial to impounded lakes and reservoir systems (Stallard, 1998; Smith et al., 2001). Several other global-scale models also show substantial transport of organic C from the continents to the coastal regions (Beusen et al., 2005; Harrison et al., 2005). These models have not directly addressed processes occurring within a watershed where C is transported from erosional to depositional sites and prior to entering long-term storage in impounded aquatic habitats. Recent coupled field and modeling study have suggested that there maybe an overall net carbon sequestration following erosion where both the erosion and deposition sites are coupled (Van Oost et al., 2005; Yoo et al., 2005). Models examining the fate of C within a watershed have primarily examined detailed biogeochemical processes for individual sites with unique parameters for erosion and deposition patches (Harden et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2003). Few modeling studies have included the observed increase in C mineralization associated with the transport event itself (Jacinthe and Lal, 2001). Thus, there is a need for theoretically driven models of erosion and deposition that included transport induced mineralization to better understand the controls on SVATs of C. The uncertainties in the performance of C-SVAT models for specific sites and their extrapolations to global C budgets are substantial. While previous studies have used detailed of modeling approaches, there is still a need for simple and tractable models that explore the principal mass balance factors in a systems-theoretic approach that influence carbon change associated with hydrologic transport (Muller, 1997). Developing hierarchical landscape models that bridge complex information from individual patches to heterogeneous regions requires linking together individual component models (Wu and David, 2002). Such needs suggest developing a coupled patch and transport model that links two sites along a hydrologic flow-path is integral to generating models that examine the role of spatial heterogeneity on ecosystem functioning (Liu et al., 2003). By developing such hierarchically linked models, questions at multiple scales can be investigated and the combined processes spanning multiple scales can be better evaluated. The research presented here had three objectives. The first objective was to build a simple model of C transport between erosion and deposition patches, which accounts for non-linearities in the C pool fluxes. To meet this objective a simplified two-patch ecosystem SOC model was developed that only considered the essential C transformations within patches and transport from a mass-balance perspective. The second objective was to identify potential soil C storage responses to erosion, both total and the distribution within an erosion\u2013deposition system, and the sensitivity of C storage to model parameterization. To meet this objective model scenarios were constructed to ask two specific questions: (1) What is the relative contribution of variation in patch specific and transport on the effect of erosion on total SOC storage? (2) (2) What is the long-term effect of erosion on total SOC storage and distribution between erosion and deposition patches? The third objective was to evaluate the potential influence of changes in management on the spatial distribution and total soil C content in a system that included erosion and deposition. In meeting this objective one question was examined: In a system that has been highly eroded, how may reducing erosion affect soil C storage? In summary, this study investigated differences in patch-specific processes, production and decomposition, and transport as it affects ecosystem C storage and terrestrial\u2013atmospheric exchanges. 2 Model description and analysis A model was developed that coupled C-SVAT at a 2-day resolution with a discrete event erosion\u2013deposition sub-routine occurring with a prescribed return interval (Objective 1). The model was developed using a systems-dynamic approach that examined changes in C mass-balance in two patches linked by a hydrologic flow-path (Fig. 1 ). This model was meant to describe C storage variation and the spatial distribution of C between erosion and deposition patches. The model was initially developed to replicate the conditions at the North Appalachian experimental watershed (NAEW) located in central OH, USA (Hao et al., 2001, 2002; Polyakov and Lal, 2004). We conducted an extensive fully factorial sensitivity analysis to study the effect of potential variation in patch and transport factors on soil C storage. Finally, a fully factorial scenario analysis was conducted to examine the potential effects of management practices that reduce erosion rates. The model simulated two patches: a source patch, where material was eroded, and a sink patch, where material was deposited (Fig. 1). The only difference between the dynamics occurring in either patch was the location along the hydrologic flow-path. Five possible mass-balance transformations of C occurring between the two patches were explicitly modeled: net primary production (NPP), decomposition, erosion, transport induced mineralization, and deposition. NPP and decomposition were simulated at a 2-day resolution. Erosion and deposition were modeled as nearly instantaneous transport events occurring at a specified return interval. Storm events were characterized with a set erosion intensity, which eroded a percentage of C from the source patch. A constant fraction of the eroded C was immediately mineralized. The remaining C was deposited at the sink patch. Unlike other C erosion\u2013deposition modeling approaches that uniquely parameterized the erosion and deposition patches, this model assumed the processes were similar at both patches and differences in rates between patches resulted from the process of erosion and deposition. The equations used to describe C flux highlight the non-linear dependence of production and decomposition on soil C content. In many agricultural and non-agricultural systems vegetation productivity decreases following losses of soil C (Lal, 1998). While this effect could result from a variety of mechanisms including nutrient deficiencies or reduced soil water holding capacity, the response can be generalized using the Michelis\u2013Menton formulation. Decomposition is commonly estimated and modeled with reference to a first-order proportion of C mineralized/unit time, k. In conjunction with a first order loss of C, several empirical and modeling studies have suggested that the decomposition rate declines following burial (Lal, 2003; Liu et al., 2003). The decrease in decomposition rate is also associated with a variety of mechanisms including decreases in oxygen and physical protection from microbial activity. The exponential decay of k in relation to soil C used in this model provides a general description of this relationship. Thus, as C-SVATs respond non-linearly to changes in temperature (Qi et al., 2002), there is a similarly non-linear response to changes in precipitation. Patch C dynamics were modeled using a general equation (Stallard, 1998; Harden et al., 1999; Polyakov and Lal, 2004): (1) d C d t = NPP \u2212 Decomposition \u2212 Erosion + Deposition To simulate the reduction in production associated with losses of soil organic matter, production was modeled as a Michelis\u2013Menton saturating function of C content: (2) NPP = NPP _ Max \u00d7 C ( NPP _ Half + C ) The Michelis\u2013Menton approach has a smooth approach to the Production_Max where the rate of increase in production depends on the C content at the site and the half saturation constant, Production_Half. Decomposition was modeled as a first-order loss: (3) Decomposition = k \u00d7 C To simulate the reduction in decomposition rate associated with the burial of C through deposition, k was modeled to decreases exponentially in response to C content of the patch: (4) k = Decomp _ Min + Decomp _ Const e ( Decomp _ Pow \u00d7 C ) Erosion was modeled as a first-order loss, erosion intensity, occurring only during erosion causing precipitation events. Deposition was equal to erosion minus a first-order loss associated with transport induced mineralization (Jacinthe and Lal, 2001; Jacinthe et al., 2002). For the simulation described herein, storms occurred at a regular recurrence interval and had a constant magnitude of effect. This simplification of precipitation and hydrologic transport facilitated in-depth sensitivity analyses and is supported empirically by the disproportionate influence of large and infrequent storm events on erosion (Meybeck et al., 2003). As the system dynamically responded to punctuated erosion events, the model was numerically simulated to examine both transitory and long-term behaviors. The equations describing transport between sites were an idealized description of precipitation regimes and the erosion\u2013deposition process. Simplifying the precipitation regime to a repeating cycle of erosion events having the same magnitude allowed for a clear separation of erosion intensity and erosion frequency that would be much more complicated if precipitation events were simulated as a stochastic process. A first-order proportion of C eroded from the upstream patch is a useful approximation for examining the long-term dynamics. Simulating a constant fraction of eroded C to be mineralized during the transport event was also a useful approximation. Where the phenomenon has been examined, transport induced C mineralization has been repeatedly shown (Jacinthe and Lal, 2001; Jacinthe et al., 2002, 2004). However, too few empirical studies have been undertaken to describe the variation in this process or its sensitivity to environmental conditions. Thus, a simple proportional loss was assumed. More complex precipitation processes will be needed for a thorough model evaluation against empirical data, but for the objectives of this paper this level of abstraction was appropriate. The parameters of the model were selected to approximate the long-term erosion patterns at the NAEW, which were recently summarized in a modeling study using the Century model (Polyakov and Lal, 2004). As in the Polyakov and Lal (2004) study, organic C stocks were modeled to a depth of 45cm. The parameter set from this initial calibration (Table 1 ) was used as a baseline for the remaining sensitivity analyses. While care was taken in model development to replicate the conditions at the NAEW, only minimal model verification was conducted. The primary goal of the present research was to identify theoretical consequences of the model assumptions and sensitivity to changes in parameters. For a more comprehensive model evaluation, the model should be compared to patterns from multiple sites under a diverse range of conditions (Rykiel, 1996) (3). To identify the potential consequences of inter-patch variation and differences in transport on erosion induced C storage (Objective 2), a fully factorial sensitivity analysis was conducted. Preliminary model exploration suggested that the model reached a quasi-steady state after 100 years throughout the range of parameter variation examined in this study. Therefore, the long-term behavior of the model was examined after this time interval had elapsed. Furthermore, because the model fluxes varied in response to erosion events, the average system state over 500 days was used to characterize model response to changes in parameters. The range of potential long-term effects associated with erosion on C storage was examined for each parameter combination by simulating the model to long-term quasi-steady state values after 100 years and then computing the average C content within both patches throughout the 500-day sampling window. This process examined four levels of variation for each of the eight factors, resulting in a total of 65,536 different scenarios. The effects of changes to model parameters on C storage were examined from the results of the sensitivity analysis. Commonly, sensitivity analyses assess model response to individual parameters by sequentially altering each parameter while keeping the remaining parameters at the baseline values (Bousquet et al., 1999). However, interactions between the effects of multiple parameters are common and cannot be evaluated using such an approach. To evaluate the fully factorial sensitivity analysis two complementary approaches were used. First, the variation in long-term C storage associated with an individual parameter was calculated by computing the standard deviation for all scenarios having the same level of the parameter of interest. The average standard deviation of C storage across the five levels of a parameter was computed as an inverse estimate of model sensitivity to changes in a given factor. Parameters with higher cross-level mean standard deviations have a lower impact on total C storage than those with a lower cross-level mean standard deviation. Because the sensitivity of total C storage to a parameter may change with the magnitude of the parameter, the standard deviation of total C storage across all levels was computed. Parameters with a higher cross-level standard deviation are those whose sensitivity varies in response to parameter changes. The standard deviation of the sensitivity estimate was computed as a direct estimate of the dependence of the role of a given factor on its specific magnitude. The second approach to analyze the influence of each parameter used a multiple regression approach to compare C storage (the dependent variable) to variation in each of the parameters (independent variables). There are many assumptions necessary for obtaining proper inferences from multiple regression analysis; however, this technique was used more as a diagnostic of the relative influence of each parameter, than as a hypothesis test. The distribution of the regression-model residuals were of particular interest for examining the interactions between parameters of the model and model output. Prior to analysis we standardized each variable by subtracting the variables mean from each case and then dividing each case by the variable's standard deviation. This transformation centered each variable to a mean of 0.0 with a new standard deviation of 1.0 (Sokal and Rohlf, 1995). A forward step-wise procedure with a relaxed inclusion criterion (p to enter<0.15) was chosen to conservatively identify the factors influencing C storage in the final regression model. To identify the response of the model to potential management and climatic conditions (Objective 3) additional sensitivity analyses were conducted where transport conditions were altered. To examine the consequences of erosion reduction on systems previously affected by erosion, a series of scenarios that simulated the effect of alternate management actions was conducted that reduced erosion without modifying any additional process. For each scenario the effect on total SOC was computed following erosion reduction by 25%, 50%, and 75%. The average absolute change in SOC storage for all scenarios at four different times: 10, 50, and 100 years following erosion reduction was calculated. 3 Results Because C fluxes were dependent upon soil C content, C trajectories within a single patch were numerically solved for soil C content ranging between 0 and 10,000gm\u22122 (Fig. 2 ). NPP, modeled as a Michelis\u2013Menton function, exhibited a characteristic saturating pattern where NPP increased with increasing C content up to a parameter defined maximum. Decomposition rates exhibited a more complex behavior; as soil C content increased the proportional amount of C decomposed declined exponentially to a minimum value. However, as decomposition was a proportion of soil C content, with increasing soil C content a higher amount of C was respired. The net C-SVAT within each patch, NPP\u2013Decomposition, exhibited three stable points of no net C flux. Two of these points were attractors, while the middle point was a bifurcation between the upper and lower alternate stable states in soil C content. Starting with an arbitrary initial C pool in each patch above the bifurcation point, the model approached a quasi-steady state, which included both the short-term and long-term consequences of erosion on the total SOC pool and the distribution of SOC between the source and sink patches (Fig. 3 ). The steady state C content for this parameter set without erosion was 5070gm\u22122, which is similar to the 5190gm\u22122 observed in the minimally disturbed meadow site at the NAEW (Polyakov and Lal, 2004). When the high erosion sub-routine was included in the simulation, the observed C content in the eroded patch for the baseline parameter set was 3900gm\u22122, also similar to the observed 3850gm\u22122 observed following long-term corn-soybean rotation at the NAEW (Hao et al., 2001; Polyakov and Lal, 2004). The long-term soil C content when all sensitivity analyses were combined exhibited two peaks in the frequency distribution (Fig. 4 ). When the scenarios were grouped by the intensity of erosion, long-term decreases in soil C content in both patches and overall were observed (Fig. 5(a)). The source patch had a higher rate of C content decrease than did the sink patch. Across the range of parameters examined, there was large variation in the long-term spatial distribution of C between source and sink patches. Depending on the parameter set used total C responded both positively and negatively to erosion. Soil C content variation, both the total and distribution between patches, was related to the intensity of erosion events, with higher variation associated with higher magnitude erosion events (Fig. 5(b)). Variation in the C storage was largest and increased at a higher rate in response to erosion intensity for the source patch than the sink patch. The long-term total and the patch distribution of C exhibited contrasting sensitivities to the eight different factors examined in conjunction with erosion (Fig. 6(a)). Ranking the magnitude each parameter's effect for total SOC showed that the patch differences, production and decomposition, had a larger effect than variation in transport, erosion force, erosion interval, and erosion induced mineralization. Among the different patch specific parameters, NPP_Max and Decomp_Min had the highest effects. Overall, there were minimal differences between the different transport processes. Examining the variation in the sensitivity of a factor also showed that the sensitivity of model output to different factors was differentially responsive to its magnitudes (Fig. 6(b)). Comparing the average standard deviations by variable shows that the sensitivity of total C content to specific parameters was influenced by the values of NPP_Max, Decomp_Min, and Decomp_Pow. The sensitivity of total C content was influenced minimally by variation in the Transport_K factor. Multiple regression analyses on the sensitivity output for total C, and the distribution of C between patches showed strong non-linear patterns in the response of C to the combination of factors (Fig. 7 ). Overall, the variation in the combination of factors explained much of the variation in long-term C pools, with similar amounts of variation statistically modeled for each patch and total C contents. For all three dependent variables, the regression model prediction varied systematically with the estimate, with negative residuals at both high and low predicted values and a positive residual at intermediate predicted values. A negative residual indicates that the regression equation is over-estimating long-term SOC storage, while a positive residual indicates the regression equation is under-estimating long-term SOC storage. The parameters identified as significant variables in the multiple regression model supported the findings from the previous sensitivity analysis (Table 2 ). Again, NPP_Max and Decomp_Min were found to be the most important parameters associated with total C. The final set of scenario runs examined the effect of reducing erosion on SOC storage at a range of temporal scales (Fig. 8 ). Erosion reduction resulted in a corresponding increase in total and source patch soil C content that was positively related to the magnitude of erosion reduction. Patch j responded to erosion reduction with a corresponding decrease in C content that was also related to the magnitude of erosion reduction. After 100 years no additional C sequestration was observed in any of erosion reduction scenarios. 4 Discussion 4.1 Model evaluation The purpose of this modeling exercise was to synthesize empirical observations into a simple theoretical description of the response of source and sink and patches in an erosion system linked through the hydrologic transport of C (Objective 1). The principles of mass balance inherent in this model are also at the essence of more complex models describing erosion (Stallard, 1998; Harden et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2003). Here, only the minimum number of processes were included to describe C transport between two sites where decomposition and production occurred; such simple models are a useful step in understanding mechanisms (Santos and Costa, 2004). Unlike more detailed modeling studies of terrestrial C transport that provide separate parameters for erosion and deposition patches, this model explicitly examined the implications of both the erosional and depositional sites being described by the same set of equations and parameters. With this simplified modeling approach, the model describes general patterns associated with erosion at the NAEW field site and exhibited the range of responses that have been attributed to erosion events in other models. At the NAEW experiments extensive studies of landscape structure, management history, and soil characteristics have been conducted in conjunction with studies of the hydrologic exports of water, sediment, and C and the rapid mineralization potential of C during transport (Hao et al., 2001; Owens et al., 2002; Jacinthe et al., 2004; Polyakov and Lal, 2004). Because of the extensive data available at this site, an integrated landscape model that combines patch specific processes with hydrologic connections throughout this watershed is possible. The modeling results presented here provide an initial framework for such a landscape scale watershed model. Because of its limited number of parameters, this dynamic modeling framework has the potential to assimilate the observed data for rigorous statistical evaluation in a hierarchical Bayesian analysis. 4.2 Modeled C storage response to erosion The model was applied to identify the controls on the C-SVAT in a linked erosion\u2013deposition system (Objective 2). The initiation and long-term consequences of erosion caused an immediate C flux to the atmosphere and long-term reduction in total C storage. This was observed both for the baseline case and in the average of all 65,536 different scenarios (Figs. 3 and 5). The resulting long-term simulations exhibited decidedly non-linear responses to parameter changes. Notably, two alternate stable states in total system C storage were observed, at high and low C content (Figs. 2 and 4). Model sensitivity was analyzed with a synthetic approach that identified variation in C storage across fully factorial model experiments. Long-term C content was affected by changes to all parameters. However, the majority of variation in model output was influenced by changes to the maximum rate of NPP (NPP_Max) and minimum decomposition rate (Decomp_Min) (Fig. 6 and Table 2). Similarly the variation in sensitivity was highest for the maximum rate of NPP (NPP_Max), minimum decomposition rate (Decomp_Min), and the decomposition decay factor (Decomp_Pow) (Fig. 6). Thus, long-term C storage was affected by changes to variation in patch C cycling over variation in transport functions. However, transitory responses to erosion events highlight the separation between short-term system response to changes in C transport and long-term dependence on C processing within the patches (Fig. 3). Reducing erosion led to an overall modeled net increase in soil C, an increase in soil C in the source patch, and a decrease in soil C in the sink patch (Objective 3). The sequestration of C into the soil was highest immediately following erosion reduction and the sink was mostly filled within 50 years with minimal sequestration after 100 years (Fig. 8). These predictions are consistent with observations in agricultural systems suggesting soil management can lead to sequestration up to 60 years (West and Post, 2002; Lal, 2004). However, much variation in the magnitude and direction of these changes suggests that site specific information is crucial for predicting the response of specific systems (Liu et al., 2003). 4.3 Synthesis Current theories of complex systems, in particular alternate stable states (Scheffer et al., 2001), may be used to understand the variation in long-term C content. As with other complex systems exhibiting alternate stable states, this model exhibited two peaks in a histogram of long-term soil C content (Fig. 4). Systems with multiple basins of attraction can be insensitive to changes in parameters and system state over large range of conditions; however, when the system approaches the bifurcation point relatively small changes in system state can flip the system into the alternate basin of attraction (Holling, 2001; Dent et al., 2002; Scheffer and Carpenter, 2003). The potential for these behaviors are often increased when spatial separation exists between system components (Rietkerk et al., 2004). In this model, transition from the high to the low C states could be induced by erosion but not overcome with a subsequent reduction in erosion. Alternate stable states behavior has been observed in other systems that couple terrestrial and hydrologic functions including grassland to desert transitions (van de Koppel and Rietkerk, 2004) and peat-bogs (Pastor et al., 2002) although through different mechanisms in these examples. In spatial systems with exchanges of material between locations, the overall spatial pattern maybe crucial in determining if alternate stable states persist to the landscape scale (van Nes and Scheffer, 2005). Extending the growing theory of alternate stable states to SOC pools in an erosion\u2013deposition sequence may help identify changes to the sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems that provide ecosystem services, especially agriculture. This model also extends the conceptual ideas of terrestrial\u2013aquatic flow paths (Grimm et al., 2003) and ecosystem hotspots (McClain et al., 2003) into a simulation modeling framework. This model shares similarities with other ecological modeling frameworks such as metapopulation theory (Wu et al., 1993; Hanski and Gilpin, 1996) and spatially explicit community interactions (Tilman et al., 1994, 1997). Similar to these modeling approaches, the processes occurring at different locations are similar; model dynamics develop from variation in the network of patches. The framework generated here maybe particularly useful in describing the effects of scale on erosion rates as found previously (Chaplot et al., 2005). Thus, this model is a prototype of a growing theory of ecosystem processes within spatially explicit landscapes, a meta-ecosystem model (Loreau et al., 2003). Finally, the modeling results presented have several implications pertinent for the on-going debate of erosion's effect on SOC storage. While individual patches will lose or accumulate carbon based upon their position in the terrestrial\u2013aquatic continuum, the total amount of soil C stored will depend on the differential rates in both patches. These rates can vary in response to transport even if similar processes are occurring in both erosional and depositional patches. Uncertainty analyses are an important next step to understand the consequences of measurement errors in the extant data on modeling carbon storage processes. Such analyses will help constrain the range of response for individual ecosystems and identify data needs that will have the most impact on reducing this uncertainty. Based on the results of this study, long and short-term changes in terrestrial C storage throughout coupled erosion\u2013deposition systems may respond respectively to patch processes, production and decomposition, and transport processes. Projecting future trends of environmental drivers, including atmospheric chemistry, climate, and anthropogenic land-use change, for specific ecosystem and for the biosphere as a whole are needed to resolve the issue of altered carbon storage resulting from hydrologic transport. 4.4 Conclusion Developing ecosystem models that highlight the transport of material in heterogeneous landscapes is an important research challenge for both landscape and ecosystem ecology. The model presented here provides an initial framework for coupling patches through the transport of material. This theoretically based model reproduces generally the qualitative patterns described by the long-term data at the NAEW station. By representing the dynamics of the coupled spatial processes in a simple model formulation, a fully factorial sensitivity analysis could be conducted. This sensitivity analysis allowed for detailed statistical descriptions of model response to changes in parameters. Furthermore, by using a simple model formulation this model can be readily scaled-up to examine landscape heterogeneity associated with a broad range of flow-path configurations. Improved understanding of ecosystems spatially separated and connected via hydrologic redistribution of C will help expand the growing theory of meta-ecosystems and reduce the uncertainty associated with C-SVATs and their response to precipitation shifts associated with climate change.

There is a need for theoretically driven models of erosion and deposition that includes transport induced mineralization to better understand the controls on SVATs of C. Here we present a model developed using a systems-dynamic approach that coupled C-SVATs at a 2-day resolution with a discrete event erosion\u2013deposition model occurring with a prescribed return interval. Five possible mass-balance transformations of C occurring between the two patches were explicitly modeled: net primary production (NPP), decomposition, erosion, transport induced mineralization, and deposition. The net C-SVAT, NPP minus decomposition, exhibited three stable points of no net C flux. Starting with arbitrary initial C pool in each patch above the bifurcation point, the model approached a quasi-steady state, which included both the short-term and longer term consequences of erosion; in the baseline simulation 5080g Cm\u22122 was stored prior to erosion and 100 years of low intensity erosion 4840g Cm\u22122 SOC remained. Low intensity erosion also generated spatial heterogeneity; from an initial homogeneous distribution to 40% of the C stored in the eroded patch and 60% of the C stored in the deposition patch. Erosion reduction resulted in a corresponding increase in total soil C content that was positively related to the magnitude of erosion reduction. In conjunction with providing a modeling framework for reducing the uncertainty in C-SVAT, this model is a prototype of a growing theory of ecosystem processes within spatially explicit landscapes, a meta-ecosystem model.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2007-01-10", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304380006003632", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Jenerette, G.
