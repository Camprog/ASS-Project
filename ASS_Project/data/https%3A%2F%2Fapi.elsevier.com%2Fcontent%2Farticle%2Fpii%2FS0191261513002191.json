Highlights \u2022 We investigate the design of a network supply chain considering uncertainty on demands and two performance measures. \u2022 A two-stage stochastic bi-objective programming model is developed to get optimal Pareto fronts. \u2022 We develop an efficient solution method based on metaheuristics to solve the bi-objective stochastic problem. \u2022 We confirm the convenience of including in the model the randomness in the demand parameter. Abstract We consider the design of a two echelon production distribution network with multiple manufacturing plants, distribution centers (DC\u2019s) and a set of candidate warehouses. One of the main contributions of the study is to extend the existing literature by incorporating the demand uncertainty of DC\u2019s within the warehouse location and transportation mode allocation decisions, as well as providing a network design satisfying the both economical and service quality objectives of the decision maker within two echelon supply network setting. In order to take into account the effects of the uncertainty we apply an scenario-based approach and a two-stage stochastic problem is formulated in order to minimize total cost and total service time, simultaneously. Another important contribution is the development of a solution procedure for this bi-objective stochastic problem by applying tabu search within the framework of Multi-objective Adaptive Memory Programming. Results are compared with the optimal Pareto fronts obtained for small instances using the \u220a -constraint method and standard branch and bound techniques. Numerical results demonstrate the computational effectiveness of the algorithm proposed. Finally, we include some results that confirm the convenience of including the randomness in the demand parameter. Keywords Supply chain design Bi-objective optimization Scenario based approach Transportation channel Metaheuristic methods 1 Introduction In this paper we address the design of a supply chain of a two-echelon distribution system. In this problem, the number and location of plants and DC\u2019s are known, but the demand of DC\u2019s is considered as a random variable modeled through scenarios. A set of potential locations for new warehouses is given where each candidate site has a fixed cost for opening a facility with a limited capacity. There are several transportation channels available for each pair of facilities between echelons. The alternatives are generated by the supplier from different companies, the availability of different types of service at each company (e.g. express and regular), and the use of different modes of transportation (e.g. truck, rail, airplane, ship or inter-modal). As can be seen, the term \u201ctransportation channel\u201d is more generic and includes not only choices for the transportation mode but also for different types of services from one or several transportation companies. Although the principles may be the same, this distinction is important to describe a more general case. Commonly, these alternatives involve an inverse correspondence between time and cost, i.e. a faster service will be more expensive. In order to balance the economic concerns with prompt demand satisfaction, our approach is to minimize the total expected cost and the maximum expected time needed for shipping the product across the whole supply chain. The deterministic version of this bi-objective problem was first introduced by Olivares et al. (2007) as the \u201cCapacitated Fixed Cost Facility Location Problem with Transportation Choices\u201d. In their contribution, the authors consider that all the design parameters are known with certainty. Cardona-Vald\u00e9s et al. (2011) extended that work incorporating uncertainty on the DC demands, which were modeled employing a scenario-based approach. They provided a two stage stochastic model where the first stage decisions were the location of warehouses to open, the choice of transportation channels; and the second stage decisions where the flow between facilities to meet DC\u2019s demands in any scenario realization. Decisions related to the transportation had an impact on the transportation time from plant to the DC, given that in that work they were looking for the same network design for all scenario realization. In the current study we get rid of this shortcoming, so the choice of the transportation channels may vary from one scenario to other. This gives more flexibility as the transportation channels are not selected in advance when the network is designed, but may be selected when the demand is known. Cardona-Vald\u00e9s et al. (2011) solved the bi-objective two-stage stochastic model designing an iterative procedure that embedded the \u220a -constraint method in the L-shaped algorithm. Their experimental work showed that using this exact approach was possible to solve only some groups of small instances, indicating us the convenience of designing other approaches as multi-objective metaheuristics, hoping to solve larger instances. In this work we propose a metaheuristic approach to approximate the Pareto front by applying a tabu search within the framework of MOAMP (Multi-objective Metaheuristic using an Adaptative Memory Procedure), strategy developed by Caballero et al. (2007). We design and implement all the involved procedures, according to the specific characteristics of our problem. The contributions of the paper are threefold. First, we extend a previously studied problem in order to include more realistic and practical assumptions such as data uncertainty and conflicting objectives. Second, we model it as a bi-objective stochastic mixed integer linear problem and used this model to obtain exact Pareto fronts for small instances. To do that, we apply a solution algorithm based on the fusion of the \u220a -constraint and branch and bound techniques. And third, we propose a solution methodology based on multi-objective metaheuristics for finding good approximations to the Pareto front for large instances. Characteristics of the problem like the two echelons, the single-source constraint and the minmax objective make the design of the involved procedures a challenging task. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents related studies found in academic literature. Section 3 describes the problem and provides the mathematical model. Section 4 is devoted to our solution methodology. Section 5 reports results concerning the performance of the proposed method and also offers a study that shows the benefit of the incorporation of uncertainty in the design of the network. Section 6 concludes with our main findings and future research avenues. 2 Literature review In the last decade, logistic network design problems have attracted the attention due to the increasing relevance of considering such networks in a world that has become progressively more globalized. The development of supply chain management (SCM) started independently of Operations Research (OR) and only step by step did OR enter into SCM. As a consequence, facility location models have been gradually proposed within the supply chain context, thus opening an extremely interesting and fruitful application domain. The location of warehouses in a SCM has been extensively studied, the term \u201cwarehouse\u201d has been used in the broadest sense to mean any intermediate facility in the logistic network (Ballou, 1999). In this way the term regional distribution warehouse, regional depot, collection center, storage site, etc. is assumed as intermediate facility between the suppliers/manufacturer plants/producers and the customer/delivery points or other final destination. Indeed, the warehousing functionality today is much more than the traditional function of storage and we may distinguish in literature several types of warehouses. According to Lambert et al. (1998) warehouses contribute to a multitude of the company\u2019s missions, as achieving transportation economies (e.g. combine shipment, full-container load), achieving production economies (e.g. make-to-stock production policy), taking advantage of quality purchase discounts and forward buys, supporting the firms customer service policies, overcoming the time and space differences that exist between producers and customers, accomplishing least total cost logistics commensurate with a desired level of customer service, supporting the just-in-time programs of suppliers and customers, providing customers with a mix of products instead of a single product on each order (i.e. consolidation), providing temporary storage of material to be disposed or recycled (i.e. reverse logistics), providing a buffer location for transshipments (i.e. direct delivery, cross-docking), etc. On the other hand, intermediate facilities plays a fundamental role in most of City Logistic projects based on distribution systems, where transportation to and from and urban area is performed through platforms, also called City Distribution Centers, located far from city limits. Freights, directed to a city and arriving by different transportation modes and vehicles, are consolidated at platforms on trucks in charge of final distribution. As Boccia et al. (2011) comment, platforms had a great impact of effectiveness of freight distribution in urban areas, but their use is showing deficiencies because of two main reasons: their positions (often far from final customers) and the constrained structure of urban areas. To overcome this limit of such single-echelon system, distribution systems have been proposed, where another intermediate level of facilities is added between platforms and final customers. These facilities, referred as satellites or transfer points, perform no storage activities and are devoted to transfer and consolidate freights coming from platforms on trucks into smaller vehicles, more suitable for distribution in city centers: Warehouses that perform freight consolidation functions and break-bulk operations that have the potential of utilizing transport capacity more efficiently, thus minimizing the environmental impact of the transport system. Several practical applications involving location of warehouses that act as intermediate point and not perform inventory functions are described in the works of Shih (2001), Jayaraman et al. (2003), Liste\u015f and Dekker (2005), \u00dcster et al. (2007), Boccia et al. (2011), and Olivares-Benitez et al. (2013). In particular, the importance of integrating location decisions with other decisions that are relevant to the design of logistics networks is clear and has been properly highlighted in the review paper by Melo et al. (2009). Although in practice a given retailer may occasionally receive shipments from multiple production facilities, practical distribution systems often employ a single-sourcing strategy, where each retailer receives replenishment from (i.e., is assigned to) a single production facility. The single-sourcing strategy offers several practical advantages, including reduced managerial coordination complexity and a decreased need for information systems integration between source facilities. Furthermore, the single sourcing assumption is often justified in practice because supplying a customer\u2019s demand from different distribution centers is perceived as poor customer service (Elhedhli and Goffin, 2005). In the supply chain context, single sourcing constraints are present in several recent practical works. Tragantalerngsak et al. (2000) describe an application in the area of telecommunications where the requirement of optical fiber of each client must be supplied from a single facility. \u00dcster et al. (2007) studied a closed loop supply chain network design problem motivated by an original equipment manufacturer in the automotive industry that provides service parts for vehicle maintenance and repair. Typically, a distribution center receives new parts from multiple suppliers and serves multiple retailers within its geographical proximity, but a retailer receives parts from only one distribution center. Boccia et al. (2011) studied the freight distribution system for an urban area problem; here single sourcing arises in both echelons of the two echelon system: each satellite has to be served by a single platform and each customer has to be served by a single satellite. More recently, Creazza et al. (2012) provided an application to a real-life supply-chain context (the Pirelli Tyre European logistics network) of an integrated logistics network design and optimization model. In their problem is required that delivery points are supplied by the regional distribution warehouses according to a single sourcing policy. Supply chains are characterized by numerous sources of technical and commercial uncertainties. Critical parameters as customer demands, prices and future facility capacities are quite uncertain. The fact that meeting customer demand is what mainly drives most supply chain initiatives motivated us to study the problem considering that the demand is a random variable whose value is not known at the time of designing the network. Literature reveals that there are several studies which deal with uncertainty in SCM at different levels. At the strategic level, there is a great deal of research in the facility location component of supply chain network design under uncertainty. A good review can be found in the study of Snyder (2006). The optimization focus in traditional SCM problems are maximizing profit or minimizing costs as a single objective (Tsiakis et al., 2001; Santoso et al., 2005). Nevertheless, other criteria to meet customer demand on time such as customer response time, or fill rate should be taken into account because they are related to the most basic functions of the SCM: to meet customer requirements. In an international context, different transportation modes are usually a consequence of natural options of transportations around the world. Despite this important feature, only few works consider the choice of transportation modes as a decision to be made, as remarked Melo et al. (2009). In their paper the authors also reviewed supply chain performance measures and optimization techniques so, that study can be useful for being depth in this area. The choice of transportation modes leads to a trade-off between time and cost in the supply chain in the studied problem, as previously demonstrated in the work of Olivares-Benitez et al. (2013). This decision produces a bi-objective problem where the cost and time criteria may not be comparable and should be considered as separate objectives leading to a multi-objective problem. The authors also demonstrated that even their deterministic version of the problem belongs to the NP-Hard type, so the stochastic problem considered in this work is at least as difficult as the deterministic one. In fact, previous experimental work of Cardona-Vald\u00e9s et al. (2011) showed that using an exact approach only some groups of small instances could be solved. The above highlights the necessity of using a heuristic method to solve the multi-objective stochastic problem. The review of Farahani et al. (2010) about multi-criteria models for facility location problems describes some works where the metrics of cost and service level are considered in deterministic problems. The metaheuristic methods mentioned include multi-objective versions of algorithms based on local search (Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search are the most prominent) or population search techniques (Genetic Algorithms and Ant Colony Optimization are the most popular). For example, Chan et al. (2006) and Altiparmak et al. (2006) applied genetic algorithms. More recently, Pishvaee et al. (2010) developed a memetic algorithm, Liao et al. (2011) proposed an hybrid of NSGA-II and an assignment heuristic and Moncayo-Mart\u00ednez and Zhang (2011) developed a Pareto Ant Colony Optimization Metaheuristic. Although Mansouri et al. (2012) recognize the importance of the use of multi-objective optimization techniques as decision support tool in supply chain management, the work of Griffis et al. (2012), about metaheuristics in logistics and supply chain management from year 1991 to 2012, point out that only few applications (near to 15%) of multi-objective metaheuristics, especially for supply chain design are developed in this area. As Melo et al. (2009) point out several publications consider either single aspect of the supply chain design (only assignment or transportation or other), or consider only single echelon. In most of the studies single objective is considered and uncertainty on parameters is ignored. The literature on multi-objective stochastic problem is still scarce. Some recent studies in this field addressing one of the aspects related to the supply chain design and management is the work of Bilsel and Ravindran (2011). Papers involving an integrated design of supply chain networks under uncertainty and considering several objectives are significantly smaller in number. Involving exact methods we could cite the works of Sabri and Beamon (2000), Guill\u00e9n et al. (2005), and Chen et al. (2008); while those employing metaheuristic techniques are still smaller in number (Peng et al., 2011). To the best of our knowledge, the bi-objective stochastic problem presented in this study has not been considered in literature in multiechelon systems. 3 Problem description The \u201cStochastic Capacitated Fixed Cost Facility Location Problem with Transportation Choices\u201d is based on a two-echelon system for the distribution of a single product in a single time period. In the first echelon the manufacturing plants send product to warehouses. The second echelon corresponds to the flow of product from warehouses to the DC\u2019s. The number of DC\u2019s as well as the number, locations and manufacturing capacities of the plants are known. There is a set of potential locations to open warehouses. The number of open warehouses is not defined. Each candidate site has a fixed cost for installing a warehouse, with a limited operational capacity. In this work we are considering distribution warehouses, that is, warehouses in which products from different suppliers are collected for delivery to a number of distribution centers (van den Berg and Zijm, 1999). We assume that warehouses do not retain inventory and their function is to consolidate the products received from the plants and to distribute them for a better utilization of the transportation system. There are several transportation options available for each pair of facilities between echelons. Each option represents a type of service with associated cost and time parameters. Each DC has an associated product demand, which must be supplied from a single warehouse, but the exact demand realization is not known in advance. Thus, the demand will be considered as a random variable modeled through scenarios. In this study we assume that the response time is influenced by the selection of the transportation channel between facilities. The implicit assumption is that a faster transportation mode is also the more expensive one, creating a tradeoff between cost and time that affects the distribution network configuration. Therefore, on one side, we are aiming to select the appropriate sites to open warehouses and determine the flow between facilities to minimize the total expected cost (involving both infrastructure and transportation costs), taking into account the uncertainty in DC\u2019s demands. On the other side, it is desired to minimize the transportation time from plants to DC\u2019s. This part of the problem determines which services will be selected in order to reduce the transportation time in each echelon of the supply chain. The tradeoff between cost and time must be considered in the formulation of a bi-objective optimization model. This means, in conjunction with the uncertainty in demands, that we are handling a novel multi-objective stochastic optimization problem. 3.1 A mixed integer programming model Given the nature of the problem, the choice of locations and the assignment between warehouses and DC\u2019s has to be decided before knowing the actual realization of demand on the future. Transportation channels could be also decided before knowing which demand scenario materializes; in this case the structure of the distribution network would be the same for all scenario realizations (Cardona-Vald\u00e9s et al., 2011). However, in many cases, this is unnecessary because the cost associated with the establishment of a transportation link is relatively small; this is especially the case when transportation is outsourced to third parties. In such cases, it could be allowed the network of transportation links to vary depending on the scenario, instead of treating these decisions as \u201chere and now\u201d variables to be fixed once and for all at the design state. This effectively allows for some reconfiguration of the supply chain network during operation (Tsiakis et al., 2001; Georgiadis and Longinidis, 2011; Kouvelis and Su, 2007). With the purpose of providing more flexibility and pay more attention to the time, the flow and transportation channel selection will be decided once the uncertainty of demand has been resolved. Therefore, it makes sense to develop a two-stage stochastic linear model with recourse, where a long-term anticipatory decision (choice of locations and assignment) must be made prior to have full information about random parameters of the problem (i.e. DC demands) and short-term decisions are available as recourse actions once the uncertainty has been revealed. The aim is to determine a here-and-now decision which minimizes the total expected costs associated with both the long-term and the short-term decisions. Due to the stochastic nature of the performance associated with the second-stage decisions, the cost objective function consists of the sum of the first-stage performance measure and the expected second-stage performance. Details on stochastic techniques can be found in Birge and Louveaux (1997). However, since in this work we employ a scenario-based approach to incorporate the uncertainty associated to the demand, the two-stage stochastic program has been modeled through its single-stage deterministic equivalent. In order to formulate the mathematical model let us introduce the following notation. The supraindices (1) and (2) are related with the first and second echelon on the supply chain, respectively. Sets I set of plants, indexed by i J set of potential locations for warehouses, indexed by j K set of DC\u2019s, indexed by k L ij ( 1 ) set of arcs \u2113 between nodes i and j L jk ( 2 ) set of arcs \u2113 between nodes j and k S set of scenarios for the demand, indexed by s Parameters c ij \u2113 ( 1 ) unit transportation cost from plant i to warehouse j using a type- \u2113 arc c jk \u2113 ( 2 ) unit transportation cost from warehouse j to DC k using a type- \u2113 arc t ij \u2113 ( 1 ) time for transporting any quantity of product from plant i to warehouse j using a type- \u2113 arc t jk \u2113 ( 2 ) time for transporting any quantity of product from warehouses j to DC k using a type- \u2113 arc q i ( 1 ) capacity of plant i q j ( 2 ) capacity of warehouse j f j fixed cost for opening a warehouse j d k s demand at DC k in scenario s p s probability of realization of scenario s Decision variables Related to the design variables (first-stage variables): Z j binary variable equal to 1 if warehouse j is opened; 0 otherwise W jk binary variable equal to 1 if warehouse j is assigned to DC k; 0 otherwise Related to the control variables (second-stage variables): U ij \u2113 s binary variable equal to 1 if a type- \u2113 arc is used for transporting product from plant i to warehouse j under scenario s; 0 otherwise V jk \u2113 s binary variable equal to 1 if a type- \u2113 arc is used for transporting product from warehouse j to DC k under scenario s; 0 otherwise X ij \u2113 s quantity transported from plant i to warehouse j using a type- \u2113 arc under scenario s Y jk \u2113 s quantity transported from warehouse j to DC k using a type- \u2113 arc under scenario s As mentioned before, our model should capture two objectives: the economical and service quality considerations of the decision maker. For convenience on the notation we define: \u2211 j \u2208 J f j \u00b7 Z j CF fixed cost \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 j \u2208 J \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 L ij ( 1 ) c ij \u2113 ( 1 ) \u00b7 X ij \u2113 s C s ( 1 ) transportation cost in the first echelon for each scenario \u2211 j \u2208 J \u2211 k \u2208 K \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 L jk ( 2 ) c jk \u2113 ( 2 ) \u00b7 Y jk \u2113 s C s ( 2 ) transportation cost in the second echelon for each scenario The objective that minimizes the cost for opening warehouses and the expected value of transportation costs is represented by the following function: (1) min f 1 = CF + \u2211 s \u2208 S p s C s ( 1 ) + C s ( 2 ) The objective that minimizes the maximum traveling time through the whole supply chain is represented by the following function: (2) min f 2 = \u2211 s \u2208 S p s max j max i , \u2113 t ij \u2113 ( 1 ) \u00b7 U ij \u2113 s + max k , \u2113 t jk \u2113 ( 2 ) \u00b7 V jk \u2113 s Subject to the following constraints: (3) \u2211 j \u2208 J W jk = 1 \u2200 k \u2208 K (4) \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 L ij ( 1 ) U ij \u2113 s \u2a7d 1 \u2200 s \u2208 S , i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J (5) \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 L jk ( 2 ) V jk \u2113 s \u2a7d 1 \u2200 s \u2208 S , j \u2208 J , k \u2208 K (6) \u2211 s \u2208 S \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 L ij ( 1 ) U ij \u2113 s - Z j \u2a7e 0 \u2200 j \u2208 J (7) \u2211 j \u2208 J \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 L jk ( 2 ) Y jk \u2113 s = d sk \u2200 s \u2208 S , k \u2208 K (8) \u2211 j \u2208 J \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 L ij ( 1 ) X ij \u2113 s \u2a7d q i ( 1 ) \u2200 s \u2208 S , i \u2208 I (9) \u2211 i \u2208 I \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 L ij ( 1 ) X ij \u2113 s - \u2211 k \u2208 K \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 L jk ( 2 ) Y jk \u2113 s = 0 \u2200 s \u2208 S , j \u2208 J (10) q j ( 2 ) Z j - \u2211 k \u2208 K \u2211 \u2113 \u2208 L jk ( 2 ) Y jk \u2113 s \u2a7e 0 \u2200 s \u2208 S , j \u2208 J (11) X ij \u2113 s - U ij \u2113 s \u2a7e 0 \u2200 s \u2208 S , i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J , \u2113 \u2208 L ij ( 1 ) (12) Y jk \u2113 s - V jk \u2113 s \u2a7e 0 \u2200 s \u2208 S , j \u2208 J , k \u2208 K , \u2113 \u2208 L jk ( 2 ) (13) q i ( 1 ) U ij \u2113 s - X ij \u2113 s \u2a7e 0 \u2200 s \u2208 S , i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J , \u2113 \u2208 L ij ( 1 ) (14) q j ( 2 ) V jk \u2113 s - Y jk \u2113 s \u2a7e 0 \u2200 s \u2208 S , j \u2208 J , k \u2208 K , \u2113 \u2208 L jk ( 2 ) (15) q j ( 2 ) W jk - Y jk \u2113 s \u2a7e 0 \u2200 s \u2208 S , j \u2208 J , k \u2208 K , \u2113 \u2208 L jk ( 2 ) (16) X ij \u2113 s , Y jk \u2113 s \u2a7e 0 \u2200 s \u2208 S , i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J , k \u2208 K , \u2113 \u2208 L ij ( 1 ) , \u2113 \u2208 L jk ( 2 ) (17) Z j , U ij \u2113 s , V jk \u2113 s , W jk \u2208 { 0 , 1 } \u2200 s \u2208 S , i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J , k \u2208 K , \u2113 \u2208 L ij ( 1 ) , \u2113 \u2208 L jk ( 2 ) Equality (3) is the single sourcing constraint between warehouses and DC\u2019s (note that as W jk is a first stage decision the assignment will be the same for all the scenarios). Constraints (4) and (5) guarantee that at most one arc is selected between nodes i\u2013j and nodes j\u2013k, respectively. The set of constraints (6) ensures that a warehouse is not open if it has no active incident arc on it, i.e. the warehouse does not receive flow of product. Equality (7) ensures that the demand of each DC is satisfied in any possible scenario. Constraints (8) guarantee capacity limits for the plants. Constraints (9) establish the flow balance at each warehouse. Constraints (10) state that the flow going out from a warehouse does not exceed the capacity of the facility. At the same time ensure that the flow of product is done only through open warehouses. Constraints (11) and (12) ensure that if one arc is used in any scenario, it must be in the chosen network design. Constraints (13) and (14) ensure that flow only uses active arcs, that is, arcs chosen for the network design. Constraints (15) guarantee that flow is allowed only if assignment between warehouses and DC\u2019s is done. Constraints (16) and (17) establish the nature of the variables. Note that constraints (11) and (12) in our bi-objective problem are not redundant, because they avoids overestimating U ij \u2113 s and V jk \u2113 s when solving for f 1 . Also note that variables W jk are required because they are employed to guarantee that the assignment between warehouse and distribution center must be the same for all the scenarios. It is worth mentioning that in case of demands and capacities must be integer, it is not necessary to change constraint (16) to require integer values for X ij \u2113 s and Y jk \u2113 s . This is due to the fact that once the values for U ij \u2113 s , V jk \u2113 s , W jk and Z j are fixed, the remaining structure is a transportation problem. It is well known that the unimodularity property produces integer results under such condition when all data are integers. Note that the presented model is not linear, due to nonlinear time objective f 2 (Eq. (2)). Actually, in the computational experimentation we used a linearized version of (2) which was obtained by introducing a set of proper new variables and constraints (Cardona-Vald\u00e9s, 2012). Even though the linearization increase in 1 + | S | + 2 \u00d7 | S \u2016 J | variables, and 1 + | S \u2016 J | + | S \u2016 I \u2016 J \u2016 L ij ( 1 ) | + | S \u2016 J \u2016 K \u2016 L jk ( 2 ) | equations, it allows us to solve the problem as a linear program. 4 Solution approach Metaheuristics have many desirable features to be an excellent method to solve very complex SCM problems: in general, they are simple, easy to implement, robust and have been proven highly effective to solve hard problems (Ramalhinho-Louren\u00e7o, 2001). Our goal is to develop a solution procedure capable of approximating the efficient frontier of our problem. The frontier would enable a decision maker to analyze the tradeoff between cost and time service. The solution method that we developed is based on MOAMP (Caballero et al., 2007) which is a framework that distinguishes itself in the crowded field of heuristic multi-objective optimization by emphasizing neighborhood search over mechanism for evolving a population of solutions. The choice is motivated by the success of both (tabu search and MOAMP) metaheuristics in solving real applications. An implementations of tabu search can be found in the work of Perugia et al. (2011), while for some implementations of MOAMP the reader is referred to the work of Garc\u00eda et al. (2013) and Pacheco et al. (2013). MOAMP looks for efficient points with an intensification process around an initial set of efficient points. To build this initial set of efficient points, it carries out a series of linked tabu searches (linked means that the last point of one search becomes the initial point of the next search) where each point visited could be included in the final efficient set. This is achieved by checking the dominance criteria for each solution around its neighborhood. Solutions that are not dominated are declared \u201cpossibly efficient\u201d and are added to a list used to update the efficient set. In our implementation, the search for non-dominated solutions is conducted on three phases. All visited points during the searches are checked for inclusion in C ND , the set of non-dominated solutions that is being constructed. Phase I Looks for efficient solutions close to the ends of the Pareto frontier, that is, solutions that approximate to the best solutions to the single-objective problems that result considering each objective separately. To do that, a GRASP method is designed for each objective function, separately. This phase also looks for additional points inside the efficiency curve. That is done through some linked tabu searches. Phase II Looks for points belonging to the efficient frontier that provide a good balance between both criteria. To do that, we perform a sequence of linked tabu searches, but using as guide functions several mixed functions of f 1 and f 2 based on the distance L \u221e to the ideal point. Phase III Intensifies the search around the points belonging to C ND . The neighborhood of all the points in this set is explored, looking for additional non-dominated points that fill the gaps in C ND . Hierarchy of the procedures involved in each phase of the general algorithm is shown in Fig. 1 . They are explained in the following subsections. 4.1 Phase I In our implementation, we first build a near optimal solution for objective f 2 (step (1) in Algorithm 1) and this point is considered as the initial point for the optimization process for f 1 (step (2) in Algorithm 1). Then, we build a near-optimal solution for f 1 (step (2) in Algorithm 1) and from this point we start the optimization for f 2 (step (4) in Algorithm 1). This is a difference with classical implementations of MOAMP. Preliminary experiments indicated that proceeding in this way we get more intermediate points on the initial efficiency curve (Garc\u00eda et al., 2013). Pseudocode of Phase I is described by Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 Phase I: Approximation to the extreme points and the initial efficiency curve Do C ND = \u2205 ; (1) Obtain a good solution S time to the time problem executing GRASPTime(); (2) Execute TabuSearch ( S time ) with f 1 as guiding function; (3) Obtain a good solution S cost to the cost problem executing GRASPCost(); (4) Execute TabuSearch ( S cost ) with f 2 as guiding function; 4.1.1 Obtaining a solution for the time problem The step (1) of phase I of MOAMP seeks to obtain a \u201cgood solution\u201d S time to the time problem (the single objective problem with objective function f 2 ). This is accomplished with a GRASP procedure, which is described by Algorithm 2. GRASP is an iterative process; each iteration is usually made up of a construction phase, where a feasible solution is constructed, and a local search phase which starts at the constructed solution and applies iterative improvement until a locally optimal solution is found. Repeated applications of the construction procedure yields diverse starting solutions for the local search and the best overall solution is kept as the result. In GRASP, a solution is constructed by incorporating one element at a time until a solution has been completed. Therefore, in each step of the process, there is at hand a partial solution. An element that can be selected as part of a partially constructed solution is called a candidate element. To determine which element will be selected to be included in a partial solution, an adaptive greedy function is used, which measures the local contribution of each candidate element to the partial solution. A restricted candidate list (RCL) with the best candidates is formed, and an element is randomly selected from this list. Once a solution is constructed, a local search is applied in order to improve this solution. More details about metaheuristic GRASP can be found in Feo and Resende (1995). In addition to the constructive phase (Constructive() in Algorithm 2) and an improvement phase (Tabu() in Algorithm 2) we perform in the time problem a post-processing (PostProcessing) hoping decreases the cost but without changing the maximum expected traveling time. Procedure GRASP: Time Constructive Algorithm Constructive() For constructing a \u201cgood solution\u201d for the time problem, we proceed in a backward form. Starting from the second echelon of the supply chain (the assignment part) we solve a generalized assignment problem as explained below. Once warehouse-DC assignments have been determined, the problem in the first echelon of the supply chain gets the structure of a transportation problem (the transportation part) so we proceed solving that part to complete a feasible solution. Since in our implementation we considered two transportation services: one fast but expensive and other slow but cheap, the constructive method will choose (on the transportation part or on the assignment part) the faster (and expensive) transportation service. It means, that transportation services are just determined, so only the product quantity that will be sent through the supply chain, and the warehouse-DC assignment remain still to be decided. Those assignments make possible to implicitly determine the product quantity to be sent from warehouses to DC\u2019s because of the single sourcing requirement. On each Constructive() step, warehouses are assigned to DC\u2019s one at a time. For all feasible assignments the maximum expected traveling time is estimated. \u201cFeasible\u201d means that the warehouse should have enough capacity to satisfy the DC demand in each scenario. The maximum expected time for assigning warehouse j to DC k, denoted by \u03c4 jk requires for each scenario s the estimation of: the maximum traveling time for the transportation part and for the assignment part. Even though the first one is straightforward, the second one is more complicated. We determine the values of product quantities to be sent in the transportation part for each scenario in an approximated way. Calculations should be seen as \u201cprovisional\u201d, i.e., as a way to estimate the maximum expected traveling time on each case. Once all feasible assignments have been evaluated (considering the traveling time and a penalization as a frequency measure determined by previous assignments between warehouses and DC), the candidate list is restricted by quality (through parameter \u03b1 ) and the warehouse-DC assignment that will be finally performed is randomly selected from that list. At this moment the product quantities sent from plants to warehouses on the transportation part are updated, since these amounts were only an estimation. That solution is used as an initial solution to solve the transportation problem to optimality, which minimizes the maximum expected traveling time for the first echelon of the supply chain. To do that we use the Time Minimization Transportation Problem (TMTP) (Sharma and Swarup, 1977). The constructive procedure finishes when all DC\u2019s have been assigned to a warehouse. Procedure GRASP: Time Improvement Algorithm Tabu() The constructed solution is now improved by a basic tabu search procedure. The neighborhood of a solution S time is denoted by N ( S time ) : Neighboring set of solutions that are reached changing the warehouse assigned to a DC in S time . Each neighboring solution is defined by the center k and the new warehouse j (j different from the warehouse currently supplying to DC k). The best solution found during the tabu search will be denoted as S time \u2217 . The estimation of the maximum expected traveling time \u03c4 jk involves the following calculations: (i) The values of the maximum traveling times related to the transportation part: For the leaving warehouse the maximum traveling time will be the maximum of the time values associated to the connecting arcs between the leaving warehouse and the DC\u2019s k that still remains assigned to that warehouse. For the entering warehouse the maximum traveling time will be the maximum value between the current maximum traveling time and the value time associated to the new arc connecting warehouse with the DC k and (ii) The values of the maximum traveling times related to the assignment part: For the leaving warehouse since demands in this warehouse will decreases d k s units, to estimate the maximum traveling time we must reduce for each scenario the product quantities that were sent from plants to this warehouse. For the entering warehouse the estimation of the maximum traveling time as the determination of the product quantities to be sent on the transportation part are similar to procedure followed in the constructive algorithm. As in the constructive procedure, those calculations must be understood as \u201cprovisional\u201d, i.e., as a way to estimate the values of the maximum traveling time on each case. We perform the best-improving movement, provided it is not tabu or satisfies the aspiration criteria \u03c4 jk < f 2 S time \u2217 . Once a movement is executed the reallocation of the warehouse previously assigned to DC k will be declared tabu for a fixed number of iterations. After performing a movement, the transportation part is solved to optimality, using methods for the TMTP. The tabu search process ends when max iter T iterations have elapsed after the iteration in which the best solution was found. Procedure PostProcessing() Once the constructive phase and improvement phase have finished a post-processing is applied to the best solution found during the search hoping decreases the cost without changing the maximum expected traveling time. This may be accomplished if we could change some chosen transportation services (from expensive-fast to cheap-slow). Procedure UpdateND() The set C ND is updated with solutions found during these searches. That is, if a solution is non-dominated by those currently in C ND , add it to C ND and remove all solutions in C ND that are dominated by it. The GRASPTime() procedure ends when max iter G iterations have elapsed without improving the best solution. 4.1.2 Obtaining a solution for the cost problem The step (3) of Algorithm 1 (Phase I) seeks to obtain a good solution S cost to the cost problem. Similar to the time problem, the solution is constructed with a GRASP procedure composed by a constructive algorithm followed by an improvement method (an analogous basic tabu search). The basic differences are: \u2022 In the constructive method the slower (and cheaper) transportation service will be chosen (on the transportation part or on the assignment part). \u2022 The function that guides the construction is the expected total cost. \u2022 After an assignment between warehouse and DC (in the constructive method) or after performing a movement (in the improvement method), the transportation part is solved to optimality, using the classical minimum cost transportation problem. 4.1.3 An initial approximated efficiency curve Steps (2) and (4) of Algorithm 1 execute a tabu search to generate an approximation to the initial efficiency curve, which is described by Algorithm 3. The functions that guide the searches are objective functions f 1 and f 2 separately. The neighborhood of a solution N ( S mid ) is compound by 4 sub-neighborhoods: N 1 ( S mid ) : Set of solutions obtained when the transportation services between warehouses and DC change in any scenario. N 2 ( S mid ) : Set of solutions obtained when assignments between warehouses and DC are changed. N 3 ( S mid ) : Set of solutions obtained when a cell is introduced to the basis when solving the problem related to the transportation part on any scenario. N 4 ( S mid ) : Set of solutions obtained when the transportation service between plants and warehouses is changed in any scenario. For simplicity, let us define the following sets: N ^ 1 ( S mid ) = S mid \u2032 \u2208 N 1 ( S mid ) : S mid \u2032 is not tabu or f i S mid \u2032 < f i S mid \u2217 N ^ 2 ( S mid ) = S mid \u2032 \u2208 N 2 ( S mid ) : S mid \u2032 is not tabu or f i S mid \u2032 < f i S mid \u2217 N ^ 3 ( S mid ) = S mid \u2032 \u2208 N 3 ( S mid ) : f i S mid \u2032 < f i S mid \u2217 N ^ 4 ( S mid ) = S mid \u2032 \u2208 N 4 ( S mid ) : S \u2032 is not tabu or f i S mid \u2032 < f i S mid \u2217 N ^ ( S mid ) = N ^ 1 ( S mid ) \u222a N ^ 2 ( S mid ) \u222a N ^ 3 ( S mid ) \u222a N ^ 4 ( S mid ) where f i are the functions that guide the searches in Phase I, i.e., f 1 and f 2 on each case. All visited points during the search are checked for inclusion in the set of non-dominated solutions C ND . Note that when the solution comes from the N 2 neighborhood the transportation part of the mixed problem is improved by reducing the cost but maintaining the maximum expected traveling time. 4.2 Phase II In Phase II we launch several linked tabu searches using mixed functions F \u03bb based on normalized and weighted distance L \u221e to the ideal point. The ideal point is characterized by the values that minimize each objective function separately. Here we will consider f 1 min and f 1 max ( f 2 min , f 2 max ) as the minimum and maximum values respectively for f 1 ( f 2 ) in solutions belonging to the current C ND , then: (18) F \u03bb ( S mix ) = max \u03bb f 1 ( S mix ) - f 1 min f 1 max - f 1 min , ( 1 - \u03bb ) f 2 ( S mix ) - f 2 min f 2 max - f 2 min where \u03bb \u2208 ( 0 , 1 ) . The values of f 1 min , f 1 max , f 2 min and f 2 max are obtained from C ND when Phase I has finished. MOAMP is based on the fact that if a point minimizes the distance L \u221e normalized to the ideal point, then it is an efficient solution. Note that function F \u03bb represents this distance weighted by \u03bb and 1 - \u03bb . It has been observed that solutions that minimize F \u03bb are also efficient. The set of all efficient solutions obtained in this way is commonly called Compromise Set and are those points of the efficient frontier that provide a good balance between the criteria (Ehrgott, 2005; Romero, 1993). In other words, they are points which without being very good at some particular criteria, have good values for all of them. Graphically, in a bi-objective problem, they are around the central region of the efficient curve, not towards the ends. Looking for compromise points we try to build a diverse enough set of non-dominated points, to subsequently intensify the search on these points in order to obtain a sample, as wide as possible, of all efficient solutions. Basically, the tabu search is similar to the one described in Section 4.1.3. The movements are the same, but now the function that guides the search is F \u03bb . A pseudocode for Phase II is presented on Algorithm 4. 4.3 Phase III This phase intensifies the search, looking for non-dominated points that fill the gaps in the set C ND , based on the proximate optimality principle. This principle establishes that the efficient solutions of a multi-objective combinatorial problem are \u201cconnected\u201d, that is, any efficient solution is close enough to another efficient solution; by \u201cclose enough\u201d is meant that in a not too extensive neighborhood of this efficient solution another efficient solution can be found. The pseudocode of Phase III is presented on Algorithm 5. When updating C ND , if the solution comes from the N 2 neighborhood, the transportation part of the mixed problem is improved by reducing the cost but maintaining the maximum expected traveling time. 5 Computational results Several experiments were conducted to check the performance of the proposed algorithm. First, we show numerical results related to optimal Pareto fronts, after that we evaluate the contribution of each phase of MOAMP and finally, we make a comparison between the estimated Pareto fronts obtained with our MOAMP implementation and the exact Pareto fronts. 5.1 Instances As summarized in Table 1 the instances are classified as: Small, Medium and Large. For each type we generate three groups according to the number of plants (P), number of candidate warehouses (W) and number of distribution centers (DC). In Table 1 each group is represented as P\u2013W\u2013DC. For each group we generate three instances, so there are 27 instances in total. Results shown in Tables 2\u20134 are averaged over three instances belonging to each group. The demand of each scenario is uniform randomly generated as follows: U ( 7000 , 20000 ) , U ( 1000 , 10 , 000 ) and U ( 15 , 000 , 20 , 000 ) with probabilities of .10, .75 and .15, respectively. The remaining parameters such as cost, traveling times, capacities and fixed cost are generated as in Olivares-Benitez et al. (2013), but considering the mean value of demand when required. 5.2 Pareto fronts Pareto fronts were generated on a framework based on the fusion of the \u220a -constraint method with branch and bound techniques, solving in each iteration the deterministic equivalent program associated to the stochastic model (Eqs. (1)\u2013(17)). For medium and large instances the exact Pareto fronts could not be obtained, therefore we impose a limit time to the solver CPLEX (tilim), in those cases the obtained fronts will be referred as upper bounds. The algorithm for generating the Pareto fronts is implemented in C calling CPLEX 11.2 on a DELL computer with two processor\u2019s Pentium Dual-Core 2.60GHz, with 4GiB memory. Results in Table 2 are averaged over three instances belonging to each group. 5.3 Parameters tuning The parameter tuning was carried out using an automated system called CALIBRA (Adenso-Diaz and Laguna, 2006). This system employs statistical analysis techniques and a local search procedure to create a systematic way of fine-tuning algorithms. The user must specify an appropriate range for the search parameters, a training set of instances and a performance measure (usually related to mono-objective problems). Given that we are tackling a bi-objective problem we decided to employ as a performance measure the unary hypervolume indicator which encapsulates a measure of the spread of the solutions along the Pareto front, as well as the closeness of the solutions to the Pareto-optimal front (Bradstreet, 2011). The hypervolume indicator consists of the measure of the dominated region of the objective space relative to some reference point. When solutions are considered as points in objective space, hypervolume is the n-dimensional space that is contained by a solution set, i.e. the n-dimensional volume of the set relative to some reference point. Due to properties of the indicator, a set with a larger hypervolume is likely to present a better set of trade-offs than sets with lower hypervolume (Zitzler et al., 2003). Assuming a minimization problem involving two objectives Fig. 2 shows the region dominated by the solution set and bounded above by a reference point r. The GRASP procedure GRASPTime() for the time problem employs the following tuned parameters. For the Constructive(): \u03b1 = 0.4 and max iter G = 250 ; and for the Tabu(): \u03b8 = | K | and max iter T = 10 \u00d7 | K | . The GRASP procedure for the cost problem employs the same tuned parameters, except max iter T = 20 \u00d7 | K | . The tuned parameters for the tabu search TabuSearch() employed on Phase I and II (Algorithms 3 and 4) are: max iter _ phaseII = 110 , max iter = 1300 and \u03b8 1 = \u03b8 2 = \u03b8 4 = 60 . 5.4 Evaluating the contribution of each phase of our MOAMP implementation This experiment attempts to measure the contribution of each phase of our MOAMP implementation toward the quality of the final approximation of the efficient set. First of all, note that phases II and III start from the estimated frontier found during the previous phase and update it by adding or removing points. Then, points obtained in any phase cannot be dominated by points found during a previous one. The main goal of phase I is to find two good-quality extreme points, for ensuring a wide estimated Pareto frontier. In addition, some intermediate points are found in this phase. The goal of phases II and III is to find more non-dominated points, that is, fill the gaps in the estimated frontier found at the end of phase I. Therefore, we have compared the number of non-dominated points (NDP) found at the end of each phase and the execution CPU time (in seconds) spent to achieve that. Results are shown in Table 3. It is worth mentioning that, in spite of the first phase of the algorithm contributes with few points, it fulfills its main task, that is, to find the best approximation to the endpoints of the set of non-dominated points. In the second phase, diversification is achieved by obtaining a dense set of points; the number of non-dominated found points is increased. The intensification is reached in the third phase where the algorithm gets more non-dominated points. It is observed that in larger instances the number of non-dominated points in this phase is greatly increased with respect to those obtained in phase two. Fig. 3 illustrate these facts in one test instance. Regarding computing times, phases I and II require similar times and they increase with the instances size. The third phase, however, is much quicker and in a few seconds finishes exploration of non-dominated points with good results. 5.5 Comparison between exact and approximated Pareto fronts The goal of the next experiment is to compare the results of our MOAMP implementation with the Pareto-optimal fronts (or the upper bound sets in some cases). For this, we are considering: the number of points of its estimated efficient frontier ( PF ), the execution CPU time (in seconds) and the hypervolume. Results are shown in Table 4. Our algorithm was implemented in Free Pascal using Object Pascal compiler and the algorithms were run on a DELL computer with two processor\u2019s Pentium Dual-Core 2.60GHz, with 4GiB memory. The results show that we obtain dense Pareto frontiers as the number of points is competitive with the number of points showed for the Pareto fronts or upper bound sets as shown in Fig. 4 . As well, analyzing the computational results, as expected, for large instances the model size increased significantly and the CPU time grew accordingly for the upper Pareto frontiers ( \u220a C) while very satisfactory computational times were obtained for the estimated frontiers (MOAMP), as it can be seen from Fig. 5 . In relation to the hypervolume measure it can be seen from Fig. 6 that we obtain better values for the estimated frontiers. Note in Table 4 that solutions obtained by MOAMP are competitive estimations of the Pareto fronts. Graphics of the Pareto frontier obtained by both procedures in one test instance is presented in Fig. 7 . 5.6 An illustrative supply chain configuration As an example consider the network of 5 plants (circles), 5 warehouses (rhombus) and 8 DC\u2019s (squares) shown in Fig. 8 with total expected cost equal to 1167686.80 units and maximum expected traveling time equal to 20.50 units. There are two transportation services where mode one is illustrated with solid line and mode two with dashed line. There are three demand scenarios with probability .10, .75 and .15, respectively, which are represented in the top, middle and bottom in Fig. 8. Each point of the Pareto frontier will provide the information represented in Fig. 8. In this example, the warehouses opened (three and four) and the assignments between warehouses and DC\u2019s are the same for the three scenarios involved, as they are anticipatory decisions. Warehouse three is assigned to DC\u2019s one, two, three, four and six; warehouse four is assigned to DC\u2019s five, seven and eight. The transportation channels and the flows between facilities on the two echelon of the supply chain depends on the scenario realization. 5.7 Studying on the benefit of the incorporation of uncertainty In order to properly evaluate the added-value of including uncertainty on the problem parameters, we will investigate two values of interest which are the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and the value of stochastic solution (VSS). The value of stochastic solution is the difference between the solutions of mean value problems (replacing random events with their means) and the stochastic solution (SS). In order to quantify it, we first need to solve the mean value problem, also referred as the expected value problem (EV). Then, by fixing the first stage variables from the EV problem, the expectation of EV (EEV) can be obtained by allowing the optimization problems to choose the second stage variables with respect to the different realization of the random variable. Similarly, since our interest is minimization, the VSS can be expressed as VSS = EEV - SS : The value of the cost of disregarding uncertainty in the problem. The EVPI measures the maximum amount the decision maker is willing to pay in order to get accurate information in the future. A solution based on perfect information would yield optimal first stage decisions for each scenario, the expected value of these decisions is known as wait-and-see (WS). Since our interest is minimization, the EVPI can be defined as EVPI = SS - WS . If were possible to know the future realization of demand, the cost will be the associated to the WS problem. However, since acquiring perfect information is not viable, we will merely consider the value of stochastic solution as the best result. The results on Table 5 show that the stochastic model provided an excellent solution as the objective function was not too far from the result obtained by the WS solution. For more details on the calculation of the VSS and EVPI we refer the reader to the work of Birge and Louveaux (1997). Those measures are designed to monobjective problems, so for our bi-objective problem we considered for calculations only the common points between the Pareto fronts compared with the same value of f 2 . As done in Guill\u00e9n et al. (2005), the procedure described for obtaining the EEV is repeated until the entire set of Pareto solutions is evaluated. The associated Pareto front is denoted by PF EEV . We proceed in a similar way for obtaining the associated Pareto front to the WS problem, denoted by PF WS . Results for the Small group are shown in Table 5, they are averaged over the number of non-dominated points taken for the computation of the metrics. Table 5 shows the average value of the EVPI in a monetary way, while EVPI \u203e % represents how much bigger is the SS solution respect the WS solution. As can be seen in all the instances there is a positive EVPI percentage value. Regarding the VSS value in Table 5 is shown the monetary difference between the EEV solution and the SS solution. It is important to observe that in some instances there no exists points for doing the calculations (indicated by \u2013), in other cases, there is no difference between solving any of those problems (in this cases the average difference between both solutions is 0.00), and finally, the case where is shown a possitive value on the VSS percentage average value indicating how much expensive could result to solve the EEV instead the SS problem. Figs. 9 and 10 show for a given test instance the points employed for the calculus of the EVPI and VSS measures (points whit the same value in the f 2 objective function). As expected, the fronts shows that the relations WS \u2a7d SS and SS \u2a7d EEV , respectively, are preserved. 6 Conclusions and future work In this paper we have addressed a problem of designing a supply chain where not only the total cost, but also the maximum time needed for shipping the product across the chain, has to be minimized. Locations for opening warehouses (from a set of candidates) as well as the assignment between warehouses and DC\u2019s have to be decided before the actual value of the DC demand is realized. A stochastic bi-objective mixed integer linear model is provided. Our main contribution relies on the effective application of the MOAMP framework to our problem. We point out that MOAMP is not a \u201cplug-and-play\u201d system that would require only a few changes to be applied in an specific problem. Instead, MOAMP is a conceptual structure that defines what to do (i.e., the three phases described at the beginning of Section 4) but not how. As the computational results showed we obtain dense Pareto fronts, in a good computation time and with a higher value of the hypervolume measure compared to the exact Pareto fronts generated (in some cases upper bound sets), showing that our solution approach based on the metaheuristic MOAMP is capable of generate good approximations of the Pareto front. A comparison between the deterministic and the stochastic solutions is performed with the aim of measuring the effect of not considering uncertainty in those situations where the environment is actually uncertain. The VSS value highlighted the importance of considering uncertainty. The results confirmed that the stochastic model provided good results while considering the cost objective function. The stochastic model takes a decision based on first-stage and expected second-stage cost and hence does not account for a decision maker risk behavior (risk-averse or risk-taker). For this reason, a more realist approach would consider higher moments where the tradeoff between the mean value and the variations of the different scenarios is appropriately reflected. An interesting research avenue derived from this work could be the consideration of unmet demand contributing with a robust formulation. In this case a penalty for unmet demand must be considered.
