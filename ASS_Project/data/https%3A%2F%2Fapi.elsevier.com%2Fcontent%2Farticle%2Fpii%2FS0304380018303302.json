Highlights \u2022 The APEX model was modified to simulate selective grazing. \u2022 Selective grazing changed diet quality, nutrient excretion, and standing residue. \u2022 Differences between na\u00efve and selective grazers were greatest in spring. \u2022 Season and plant water stress interacted to affect urinary and fecal N excretion. Abstract We modified the grazing module of the APEX simulation model to allow for selective grazing of plant species and dietary-specific excretion of urine and feces. To determine the sensitivity of these changes on nutrient flows, vegetation responses, and grazer diet, we simulated the conditions of a 20-year historic grazing treatment conducted in Kansas, United States of America. Simulated scenarios were a factorial of 2 grazer types (na\u00efve and selective) and 3 stocking densities (high, medium, low). Na\u00efve grazers represented model behavior before our modifications. Selective grazers selected forage species based on crude protein content, digestibility, and anti-quality factors. We found that the new selective grazing algorithm resulted in a change in grazer diet quality, nutrient excretion, and standing vegetation residue. The difference between selective and na\u00efve grazers varied over the course of the grazing season, with greatest differences occurring early in the year. C3 grasses were generally preferred in the spring, after which time C4 grasses were preferred until autumn. Simulated diet quality was relatively insensitive to stocking density, although stocking density did impact standing vegetation residue. Urinary and fecal N excretion varied seasonally and interacted with weather-induced plant water stress. The revised model\u2019s ability to simulate differences in vegetation residue, diet quality, and nutrient excretion provide necessary building blocks to use or improve the model for the simulation of animal production, sediment erosion, water runoff, N and P runoff, and soil C accretion. The model\u2019s performance might be improved by tracking individual plant components (e.g. leaves, stems, seeds, mast), albeit at the cost of greater input requirements. Keywords Selective grazing Stocking density Nutrient management Biomass Water stress APEX 1 Introduction Agricultural managers and policymakers monitor flows of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) because of their impact on productivity and their potential to cause environmental harm, such as the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico (White et al., 2014). Nutrient flows in agricultural systems are affected by weather, plant species, and management (Rotz et al., 2005), among other factors. Grazing adds a layer of complexity to nutrient cycling not found in farming systems that lack animals, because the chemical forms of nutrients are transformed by grazers. Herbivore management can also impact grazing land biomass productivity and litter cover, which influence water infiltration capacity (Fraser and Stone, 2016), runoff (Hart and Frasier, 2003), and nutrient return to soil through decomposition and mineralization (Shariff et al., 1994). Grazing lands occupy \u223c40% of Earth\u2019s terrestrial landmass (FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), 2005) and store approximately 10% of global soil carbon (Nosberger et al., 2000). Grassland management influences flows of N and P (Heyburn et al., 2017) and can also increase or decrease quantities of soil organic carbon (Conant et al., 2017), an essential component of healthy soil and a key piece of global carbon cycling. Agricultural models, like APEX (Gassman et al., 2010; Fig. 1 ;https://epicapex.tamu.edu), allow scientists and policy-makers to develop \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios with different management practices to simulate management\u2019s impact on productivity and the environment. Since 2003, the APEX model has been used in this capacity by the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) within the United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). APEX is a deterministic, process-based model that simulates soil processes, plant growth, agricultural management, and environmental outcomes. A strength of APEX over the closely related model, EPIC (Williams et al., 1984), is that APEX can simulate spatial extents ranging from field patches to small watersheds. For grazing applications, this means that APEX could be used to simulate spatial plant-herbivore dynamics at pasture, ranch, or small watershed scales. However, simulating agricultural systems that include grazers presents a unique set of challenges not faced when simulating cropland (Jones et al., 2017), including the simulation of biologically diverse vegetation, plant-animal interaction, nutrient transfers (Snow et al., 2014), and the longer time frames needed to simulate perennial herbaceous and woody species (Jones et al., 2017). The APEX model\u2019s ability to simulate prairie plant growth was recently improved (Zilverberg et al., 2017) so that the NRCS could use APEX to simulate grazing land as well as cropland. However, the model\u2019s simulation of plant-herbivore interactions remained simplistic, and thus needed improvement to better simulate conservation practices involving grazing management. Domestic and wild grazers select a diet from among the choices found in their environment. Diet selection is the result of a complex interaction of animal and environment (Stuth, 1991; Provenza et al., 2003). It has long been recognized that preference for a plant species commonly changes throughout the year (e.g., Dyksterhuis, 1948; Senft et al., 1985; Stuth, 1991), as the plant\u2019s concentration of nutrients changes, its digestibility changes, its chemical constituents change, and even as its physical structure changes. When grazers continually select preferred plant species while ignoring non-preferred species, they can shift the competitive balance of those plant species in their environment. For instance, differences in stocking rates in the Great Plains of North America create different vegetation communities (Launchbaugh, 1967; Hanson et al., 1978; Porensky et al., 2016). Subsequently, grazers\u2019 diet choices are limited to the plant species present in the altered vegetative community. Diet intake can also be altered due to changes in biomass availability resulting from grazing, thus constraining future selectivity and/or selection of lower preference species (Walker, 1993) Rangeland models commonly include features to allow selective grazing. For example, the Savanna model (Coughenour, 1993) allows the user to rank plant species according to preference by each grazer species. EDYS (Coldren et al., 2011) goes a step further by also subdividing plant species by plant parts. The Sustainable Grazing System model (Johnson et al., 2003) assigns preference parameters to individual species as well as leaf vs. stem within a species (B. Cullen, personal communication). PHYGROW (Stuth et al., 2003b), allows the user to assign a preference class (preferred, desirable, undesirable, or non-consumed) rather than a numerical ranking to each plant part (leaf vs. wood) and growth stage (rapid, dormant, and dead) of each plant species, for each grazer animal species. GPFARM-Range assigns preference values to plant functional groups (Andales et al., 2005). Blackburn and Kothmann (1991) developed a model that incorporated nitrogen concentration, digestibility, and anti-quality factors of the plant species into a single equation to determine its desirability. Originally a crop model, APEX lacked simulation of selective grazing; its grazers consumed plants in equal proportion to their environmental abundance. To address shortcomings in APEX\u2019s handling of selective grazing and nutrient cycling related to grazing, we made several updates to the model. The purpose of this article is to describe those changes, demonstrate the impact of those changes under various scenarios, and identify the model\u2019s sensitivity to changing environmental and management conditions. We hypothesize that, 1) our model updates will more accurately depict seasonality of grazing preferences for certain plant species as compared to older versions of APEX, 2) simulated selectivity will decrease as stocking density increases, 3) preferred plant species will have less standing mass at the end of the grazing season when grazed by selective grazers rather than na\u00efve grazers, 4) at the end of the grazing season, total residue and total standing mass will not differ between selective and na\u00efve grazers for a given stocking rate, and 5) excretion of N & P will vary with season and environmental conditions. 2 Updates made to the model The APEX (Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender) model is designed to simulate the impacts of agricultural management on whole farms and small watersheds. It uses a daily time step and is primarily deterministic. The model\u2019s major components were described by Gassman et al. (2010) and are represented in Fig. 1. To enhance plant-animal interactions in APEX, we began by requiring additional input specifications at the plant and animal levels. These will be described, followed by several sections detailing the plant-animal interaction. Initial efforts have focused on beef cattle production because this is the dominant type of animal production on U.S. grazing lands and because of the detailed information available. However, the design remains flexible to allow anticipated expansion for other types of grazers. 2.1 Vegetation specifications Previous versions of APEX included nitrogen concentration ([N]) of standing live and dead plant species, so it was a simple matter to calculate crude protein (CP) of forage as 6.25 * [N]. However, APEX did not include measures of digestibility or energy content of forages. Thus, we added the ability to simulate total digestible nutrients (TDN), which ranges from 0 to 100. To estimate TDN, the user enters a maximum and a minimum TDN value for each forage. The model simulates changes in TDN on a daily basis using a linear equation that decreases from the maximum to the minimum according to the plant\u2019s maturity. For example, suppose a species requires 1400 heat units to reach maturity, has accumulated 1000 heat units in the current year, and has maximum and minimum TDN values of 80 and 50, respectively. Its current TDN would be: 80 - (1000/1400) * (80-50) = 58.6. 2.2 Grazer specifications A grazer specification file, which includes all of the grazer types that can be used in a simulation, was developed for the updated model. As with crop and forage species, the file comes with preloaded default values, but these can be changed by the user. Users can also create new grazers. Grazers are defined, in part, by their full body weight (FBW, kg) and an option for how to calculate daily dry matter intake (DMI, kg). In this study, we restrict our use to APEX\u2019s simple intake option, which assumes that grazers are neither gaining nor losing body weight and that daily dry matter forage intake is a percentage of body weight: [1] DMI = PB * FBW where PB is percentage of body weight defined by the user in the grazer input file. Grazers are also described by their thresholds for preferred, desirable, and undesirable forage, as well as their tolerance for forage anti-quality factors. These are described in detail in section 2.5. In the previous version of APEX (APEX 1501), only one herd could graze an area at a given time. This restriction has been removed, so that an unlimited number of herds can graze an area at the same time. Each herd is composed of homogeneous individuals, except for a cow-calf herd, which includes both cows and calves at certain times of the year. Each grazer also has a stocking density (ha animal\u22121) and grazing threshold (kg ha\u22121). When standing forage, including both live and dead, passes below this threshold, the grazer ceases grazing. Optionally, the user can choose to have deficits of intake demand filled with hay. Because each grazer has a unique threshold, it is possible to allow one herd to continue grazing while another herd is fed hay or rotates to a different subarea. When plant growth brings standing forage above the grazing threshold, grazing of a subarea resumes if grazers are present; hay consumption is reduced accordingly. 2.3 Water intake The quantity of water consumed is the sum of free water intake (drinking water) and water contained in the forage or feed consumed. Free water (FW, liters) is calculated as a function of heat (Ball et al., 1999), using: [2] FW = 0.076 * FBW0.7086 * TX0.7146 where TX is 2.0 or the maximum daily temperature (\u2070C), whichever is greater. Water content (WC) of standing dead vegetation was assumed to be 10%. Water content of standing live vegetation follows an s-shaped curve, decreasing from 75% water content at emergence to 25% water content at maturity. 2.4 Excretion of urine and feces All forage consumed is assumed to be digested or excreted. The portion of ingested forage that is digestible is defined by TDN. Thus, the dry weight of feces is: [3] FECES = DMI * (1\u2212(TDN/100)) where TDN ranges from 0 to 100. The quantity of urinary water produced is a fixed percentage of water consumption based on the work of Paquay et al., 1970a, b) and Betteridge and Andrewes (1986): [4] Urinary water = 0.31 * (WF + FW), where WF is the volume of water in forage consumed, in liters. APEX simulates the cycling of N and P. For grazing animals, most nutrients are either excreted in feces and urine or contained in animal products, such as weight gain or milk. Small amounts of nutrients may be lost via other avenues, such as hair fall and saliva, but these are insignificant for purposes of this simulation. Therefore we ignore these other losses and conserve N and P within the system by using equation 5: [5] nutrient excreted = nutrient intake \u2013 nutrient in products. For animals at homeostasis, nutrient in products = 0, and thus all N and P consumed are excreted in feces or urine. Excreted P (PE) is assumed to be partitioned among urine (PU) and feces (PF) as follows, based on Karn, 2001 review of the literature: [6] PU = 0.04 * PE [7] PF = 0.96 * PE. The fraction of N that is excreted (NE) in urine rather than feces increases with dietary CP concentration (DCP, %). We employed an equation developed by Waldrip et al. (2013) to adjust the fraction of N excreted in urine (FNU) with changes in DCP: [8] FNU = 1.8 * DCP + 28.8. Then, total urinary N (NU) and fecal N (NF) are given by: [9] NU = NE * FNU [10] NF = NE \u2212 NU where NE is total N excreted. Urinary and fecal N and P are returned to the soil surface in mineral and organic forms (Table S1). Urinary N is treated as mineral N because although urinary N is primarily urea, it is quickly converted to ammonium in the soil (Bussink and Oenema, 1998). The concentration of C in urine is simulated as 43% of the concentration of mineral N in urine, following the elemental proportions of urea. The concentration of C in feces is a constant 35% of the fecal dry weight. 2.5 Diet selection The most biologically important and computationally intensive improvement to APEX grazing was the implementation of selective grazing. In previous versions, APEX grazers had indiscriminately consumed standing forage in equal proportion to its fraction of the total standing mass. That is to say, if the standing live mass of a particular grass species composed 30% of the total mass of standing live and dead vegetation, it also composed 30% of every grazer\u2019s diet. Differential forage preference, the \u201cmeasure of relative intake of alternative forages\u201d (Allen et al., 2011) was lacking. The revised version adopts the general approach and empirical equations of the PHYGROW model (Stuth et al., 2003b). PHYGROW has been used for more than a decade to simulate anticipated forage shortages (Stuth et al., 2003a, 2005; Angerer, 2012). In PHYGROW and the revised version of APEX, the preference by a certain grazer for a certain unit of vegetation on a given day is classified in one of four categories: 1) Preferred, 2) Desirable, 3) Undesirable, or 4) Non-consumed. These categories are the same as those used by the NRCS, Bureau of Land Management, and United States Forest Service when developing an Ecological Site Description (ESD), as well as PHYGROW. However, both PHYGROW and ESD\u2019s use the additional categories of Emergency and Toxic. Because these categories only apply to extreme situations, and because APEX does not simulate the effects of toxic forage consumption, the Emergency and Toxic categories were not included in APEX for purposes of simplification. For the NRCS, the unit of vegetation is the plant species, which, when supported by direct observation and/or literature, may further be divided into plant parts (leaves, stems, twigs, fruit/mast). For PHYGROW, each species has 10 potential units of vegetation for which a preference class must be defined: four herbaceous growth stages, four woody growth stages, herbaceous litter, and woody litter. Thus, PHYGROW simulations require inputting a number of plant-animal matrices, one for each grazer, that define the preference of that grazer for each of the plant species and its 10 potential growth and litter stages. The EDYS model (Coldren et al., 2011) takes a similar approach, but includes as many preference categories as there are plant species. Thus, both PHYGROW and EDYS require that a user input large plant-animal preference matrices. The mathematical model described by Senft (1989) requires assigning preference parameters for each plant species or plant community. This approach is \u201cvalid across different mixes of the same species\u201d but requires re-recalculation of a parameter when species are added or subtracted from the list (Senft, 1989; p. 299). APEX takes a different approach to assigning preference classes. This approach seeks to limit the number of user inputs required, while remaining general enough to apply to many ecosystems with few or no changes required to input parameters. Standing N (g m\u22122) of a plant community has been shown to be correlated with grazing preference (Senft et al., 1985). On a daily basis, APEX calculates a forage quality (Qgf) for each combination of forage (f) and grazer (g) based on nitrogen concentration, total digestible nutrients, and forage anti-quality factors, based on the approach of Blackburn and Kothman (1991). APEX adds a fourth factor not included by Blackburn and Kothman (1991), the grazer\u2019s tolerance to forage anti-quality factors: [11] Qgf = Minimum(0.032, N concentration [g g\u22121]) * Minimum(0.9, TDN [g g\u22121]) * Minimum(1, 1 + Grazer anti-quality tolerance - Anti-quality of forage) where the grazer anti-quality tolerance ranges from 0 (no tolerance) to 1 (unaffected by anti-quality factors) and forage anti-quality also ranges from 0 (no anti-quality factors) to 1 (extreme anti-quality factors). Anti-quality factors may be chemical (e.g., tannins) or physical (e.g., spines). Qgf is calculated separately for standing live and standing dead of each forage. Then, the Relative Qgf (RQgf) of each live and dead forage is calculated as: [12] RQgf = Qgf/Maximum(Qgf) where Maximum(Qgf) is the maximum Qgf value of all forages for a particular grazer. Each grazer in APEX has three RQg thresholds that define when forages pass from Preferred to Desirable, from Desirable to Undesirable, and from Undesirable to Non-consumed. For instance, a grazer with RQg thresholds of 0.15, 0.60, and 0.95 would consider all forages with RQgf > (1.0 \u2212 0.15) to be Preferred, those from (1.0 \u2212 0.60) to (1.0 \u2212 0.15) to be Desirable, those from (1.0 \u2212 0.95) to (1.0 \u2212 0.60) to be Undesirable, and those <(1.0 \u2212 0.95) to be Non-consumed. The same thresholds are used for all forage species. APEX maintains separate pools of standing live and dead forage for each forage species, each with its own RQgf; therefore, live and dead biomass of the same species can simultaneously be in different preference classes. Litter (plant material lying on the ground) is not consumed by grazers in APEX. Except to distinguish between living and dead biomass, APEX does not maintain separate pools of standing biomass. That is to say, it does not distinguish between leaf, stem, or woody biomass. In APEX, Preferred forages are consumed in greater proportion than their contribution to the total standing mass. Undesirable forages are consumed in smaller proportion than they occur in the total standing mass. The proportional consumption of Desirable species depends upon other forages available. The equations were derived by Quirk and Stuth (1995): [13] PFRACg = 1 \u2212 e\u22123.65 * PF gi / TF gi [14] UFRACg = 0.031971 * e2.89 * UF gi / TF gi [15] DFRACg = 1.0 \u2212 UFRACg \u2212 PFRACg where g refers to the grazer, i refers to the day, PFRAC refers to the fraction of the diet that is Preferred, PF is the quantity (kg ha\u22121) of Preferred forage, TF is the sum of all standing live and dead forage (kg ha\u22121), UFRAC is the fraction of the diet that is Undesirable, UF is the quantity of Undesirable forage (kg ha\u22121), and DFRAC is the fraction of the diet that is Desirable. If there are more than one species in the same preference class, they will be consumed in their relative proportions. For example, if species \u201cA\u201d (500 kg ha\u22121) and species \u201cB\u201d (750 kg ha\u22121) are both Preferred forages, PFracg = 80%, and DMI is 10 kg, the grazer will consume 8 kg of preferred forage. Of the 8 kg, 3.2 kg will come from \u201cA\u201d and 4.8 kg from \u201cB.\u201d Because both PFRAC and DFRAC range between 0 and 1 but sum to less than 1, an animal\u2019s diet is always guaranteed to contain all forages classified as Preferred, Desirable, or Undesirable, assuming there is enough forage to meet the grazing threshold. Thus, a mixed diet is achieved but the results are deterministic. Spatial simulation of grazing is possible when simulating more than one subarea, but a herd in the model can only graze one subarea per day. Thus, simulating vegetation \u201cpatchiness\u201d and spatial selectivity of grazing stations at the sub-paddock level is currently not possible with APEX. When multiple grazers demand the same plant species and life class (live or dead) in greater proportion than its availability, APEX executes a conflict resolution algorithm. Consumption of the species and life class demanded is proportionally reduced for each grazer such that all available is consumed. Then, to make up the grazers\u2019 demand deficit, each grazer consumes remaining species in proportion to their fraction in the standing mass\u2014that is to say, na\u00efvely. This na\u00efve grazing is used for conflict resolution because it requires less computation than required by executing preferential grazing an unknown number of times, and because the amount of the grazers\u2019 diet affected would typically be small over the course of a simulation. 3 Sensitivity analysis To test the sensitivity of the new features added to APEX, we simulated plant-animal interactions at Hays, Kansas, USA (38.87 N, 99.31 W). This site corresponds to the Loamy Upland ecological site in Major Land Resource Area 73 (USDA NRCS (United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service), 2006). A long-term grazing experiment at Hays was described by Launchbaugh (1957), 1967) and the different vegetation communities were simulated by Zilverberg et al. (2017). Mean annual precipitation from 1936 to 1965 was 586 mm, of which 79% fell from April through September (NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), 2015). Mean annual temperatures for the period were: annual maximum, 42 C; daily mean, 12 C; and annual minimum, \u221224 C (NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), 2015). Pastures were grazed by yearling steers or heifers from May 1 to Oct. 1 or Nov. 1, except when grazing was terminated early due to lack of forage (Launchbaugh, 1967). We simulated the Hays site using the same input soil (Harney silt loam), time period (1936\u20131965), and historic weather (NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), 2015) as Zilverberg et al. (2017). We used the same input vegetation as the light grazing treatment from Zilverberg et al. (2017), which included two perennial C4 grasses [blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides)], one perennial C3 grass [western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii)], an annual C3 grass [Japanese brome (Bromus arvensis)], and a perennial forb [western ragweed (Ambrosia psylostachia)]. Vegetative species were based on Launchbaugh, 1967 measurements. All grasses were given values of 0 for anti-quality factors. Ambrosia psylostachia was simulated with a 0.7 anti-quality factor at emergence and 0.9 at maturity. To demonstrate the degree of selectivity introduced by the model improvements, we simulated two different grazer types: 1) \u201cna\u00efve\u201d grazers like those of previous versions of APEX, and 2) \u201cselective\u201d grazers that demonstrated preference for specific forages. The selective grazers were yearling steers weighing 313 kg throughout each grazing season. We used a value of 2.5% for DMI. The hay-feeding option was not used. We applied three different stocking densities (0.5, 0.7 or 1.25 animal ha\u22121) to the vegetation from the historic light grazing treatment (Launchbaugh, 1967) to test our hypothesis that selectivity would decrease as stocking density increased. Grazers and stocking densities were applied in a factorial arrangement, such that we had 6 total scenarios (2 grazers \u00d7 3 densities). The model was run once for each scenario. Each simulation included the years 1936 through 1965. We report the final 20 years of each simulation, which correspond to the 20 years of the historic grazing experiment (1946\u20131965). To evaluate selectivity of simulated grazers, we used Vanderploeg and Scavia, 1979 electivity index, E*, which Lechowicz (1982) recommended from among a suite of electivity indices. The equation is: [16] Wi = (ri/pi)/(\u2211 ri / pi) [17] E*i = [Wi \u2212 (1/n)]/[Wi + (1/n)] where r is the quantity of forage consumed (kg ha\u22121), p is the quantity of forage available (kg ha\u22121), and n is the number of forages. We calculated a single E* for each forage species, including both standing live and standing dead mass. E* was calculated on a daily basis for the duration of the simulation. We report the mean daily value of E* for each forage, and interpret larger E* values as indicators of greater preference. To further demonstrate the impact, or lack thereof, of selective grazing, stocking density, and weather on environmental variables, we also report the following for each scenario: DMI by plant species; water consumption; total urinary and fecal N & P; and end of grazing season standing live, dead, and surface residue. Finally, to demonstrate the variation in nutrient cycling caused by the interaction of model updates and environment, we evaluated urinary and fecal N excretion on the 3rd day of each month from May through Sep. of each of the 20 simulated years at the moderate stocking density, using selective grazers. On each day, we developed a simple linear regression relating a dependent variable, urinary N excreted (kg animal\u22121) or fecal N excreted (kg animal\u22121), to a dependent variable, water stress. Water stress was the mean water stress value of the five forage species. Water stress values range from 0 (extreme stress) to 1 (no stress). We report the r2 of each regression and the p-value of an F-test of the regression. 4 Results of sensitivity analysis 4.1 Intake of na\u00efve and selective grazers as affected by stocking density Daily dry matter intake was held constant for na\u00efve grazers (representing older versions of APEX) and selective grazers (demonstrating new features) in order to simplify interpretation of results, but intake varied by stocking density and plant species (Fig. 2\u20133 ). In a few years, there was insufficient forage to meet grazer demand near the end of the season at the highest stocking density; this is reflected in a slightly lower mean intake in late August, September, and October (Fig. 2). Selective grazers demonstrated seasonal changes in preference for plant species, supporting our first hypothesis. Selective grazers\u2019 preference for the C4 perennial grasses endured most of the year at all stocking densities; preference for other species was more variable throughout the grazing season (Fig. 3\u20134). Contrary to our second hypothesis, selectivity was relatively unaffected by stocking density (Fig. 4). Free water consumption followed seasonal temperature patterns for both na\u00efve and selective grazers (Fig. S1). A consequence of selective grazing was that the selective grazers maintained a higher diet quality than the na\u00efve grazers for most of the season, whether measured as concentration of nitrogen or digestibility (Fig. 5 ). The difference in diet quality between the grazer types was greatest early in the grazing season; across all stocking rates, selective grazers choose a diet that averaged 70% TDN and 11.3% CP through July 15, compared with 68% TDN and 9.6% CP by na\u00efve grazers. After July 15, diets were similar in digestibility (60% for both types of grazers) and CP (6.6% for selective; 6.2% for na\u00efve; Fig. 5). 4.2 Nutrient excretion Simulation results supported our fifth hypothesis, that excretion of N & P would vary with season and environmental conditions. Quantity of nitrogen excretion reflected dietary differences between selective and na\u00efve grazers, as well as seasonal changes in nitrogen consumption (Fig. 6 ). The percentage of total nitrogen excretion that was excreted in urine followed the same pattern as the total quantity, ranging from nearly 60% for selective grazers in early spring to less than 40% for selective and na\u00efve grazers in mid summer (Fig. 7 ). Excretion of phosphorus in urine was minimal (Fig. S2). Excretion of phosphorus in feces generally declined over the course of the grazing season and varied more for selective grazers than na\u00efve grazers (Fig. 6). Phosphorus excretion was generally greater for selective grazers than na\u00efve grazers (Fig. 6). Year-to-year variation in daily urinary and fecal N excretion (kg animal\u22121; Fig. 8\u20139 ) on the 3rd day of the month was relatively high in some months (i.e., May, June) compared to others (i.e., July, Aug., Sep.). Urinary and fecal N excretion increased when plants were less stressed in June and July (p < 0.01), but the same relationship was weaker in May (p = 0.09 for urinary N and 0.02 for fecal N), and not significant (p > 0.10) in Aug. or Sep. (Fig. 8\u20139). 4.3 Forage residue At the end of the grazing season, mass of standing dead plant residue was less for selective grazers than for na\u00efve grazers at all stocking densities, whereas biomass of standing live was greater for selective than na\u00efve grazers at all stocking densities (Fig. 10 ). This counterintuitive result occurred because selective grazers left more living biomass of the forb A. psylostachia and less of the C4 grasses B. dactyloides and B. gracilis at the end of the grazing season (Fig. 10). However, when standing live and standing dead residue were summed together and averaged across stocking rates, there was virtually no difference between na\u00efve (969 kg ha\u22121) and selective grazers (945 kg ha\u22121). Likewise, flat residue (i.e., litter) was virtually the same for na\u00efve (9.5 kg ha\u22121) and selective grazers (8.5 kg ha\u22121; Fig. 10), supporting our fourth hypothesis. Biomass of standing live, standing dead, and flat residue decreased as stocking density increased (Fig. 10). Grazer type interacted with plant species in determining the quantity of standing live and standing dead biomass remaining at the end of the grazing season (Fig. 10). In support of our third hypothesis, selective grazers left disproportionately more A. psylostachia and B. arvensis and disproportionately less of the perennial grasses (B. dactyloides, B. gracilis, and P. smithii) than did na\u00efve grazers. The effects on B. dactyloides, B. gracilis, and A. psylostachia were exaggerated by stocking density. That is to say, differences were greatest when stocking densities were greatest (Fig. 10). 5 Discussion 5.1 Selective grazing Upgrading the APEX model to allow selective grazing caused changes in simulated intake of individual plant species (Fig. 2\u20133). This change started a chain reaction which affected dietary quality (Fig. 5), the quantity of nutrients excreted (Fig. 6, S2), the form of nutrients excreted (Fig. 7), and residue left in the pasture at the end of the grazing season (Fig. 10). Changes in diet quality and nutrient cycling could affect long-term productivity and profitability. The ability to better simulate changes in nutrient excretion caused by selective grazing also has broader implications for improved modeling of livestock systems. For instance, increased excretion of nitrogen by selective grazers changes the chemical form of this nutrient from primarily organic forms found in plants to urea in urine, impacting its availability to plants and susceptibility to loss from the agricultural system (Cameron et al., 2013). Therefore, models that do not provide for selective grazing could misrepresent nitrogen losses. Relative to na\u00efve grazers, selective grazers avoided B. arvensis during the early grazing season, but increased preference for this species as autumn approached. The simulated increase in preference with the approach of autumn was due to the decline in quality of other forages, which improved the relative palatability of the senesced B. arvensis. This cool season annual is generally recognized as a poor forage, although it likely would have been among the preferred forages if the simulated growing season had begun earlier than 1 May. As it was, this early growing forage had already declined significantly in quality by 1 May. In the field, we have observed a preference for the seeds of B. arvensis when it reaches maturity at the end of spring in some years, but the model did not capture this dynamic because it does not allow for grazing of individual plant parts. The other cool season grass, the perennial P. smithii, was the preferred forage at the beginning of the grazing season (Fig. 4), but preference for this perennial declined quickly as it approached maturity in late spring. Preference for P. smithii slowly rebounded from midsummer onward, as small amounts of regrowth became available. In the cool autumn temperatures at the close of the grazing season, P. smithii was once again the preferred forage (Fig. 4). At the beginning of the grazing season, grazers were indifferent to the C4 grasses, B. dactyloides and B. gracilis, indicated by both species having E* values near 0 (Fig. 4). However, preference for these species quickly increased and remained high throughout the grazing season. This can be attributed to their lesser degree of maturity at the outset of summer relative to the C3 grasses, and the relatively high forage quality of their senesced forage in late summer and early autumn. This result agreed with expectations based on anecdotal field observations. Preference for the perennial forb, A. psylostachia, was initially low in spring, when much of its standing mass was the previous year\u2019s senescent growth and it was competing with relatively high quality perennial grasses. As summer approached and the grasses reached maturity, relative quality of the slowly-maturing A. psylostachia improved somewhat. However, as summer progressed and A. psylostachia continued to increase in maturity, its E* declined until the beginning of autumn, when most forage had senesced. Overall, the preference for A. psylostachia was relatively low, given its high CP and digestibility values. These positive factors were more than offset by high input values for anti-quality factors in the forage. Generally speaking, simulation results accurately represented grazer preferences expected from field observations. It was not surprising that selective grazers chose a higher quality diet than na\u00efve grazers before 15 July (Fig. 5). However, the similarity in diet quality after 15 July was unanticipated. This was likely the consequence of all forages being relatively mature and there being little difference in quality among the 5 forage choices. In addition to weaknesses already mentioned, the model lacks mechanisms for simulating specific secondary compounds (e.g. alkaloids, saponins, tannins) found in forage as well as the past experience of individual animals, both of which influence foraging decisions (Villalba et al., 2015). For instance, Lyman et al. (2012) observed that cattle increased foraging on plants containing high concentrations of alkaloids after first grazing on forages with high concentrations of saponins, but APEX cannot currently simulate this complex behavior. Likewise, APEX\u2019s approach to simulating toxins is to reduce the desirability of a particular forage by including an \u201canti-quality\u201d parameter, but the model does not include thresholds at which consumption of the toxin limits intake due to a satiation effect, as described by Provenza (2003). Another area where the complex reality of grazing is simplified by the APEX model is in the spatial aspects of grazing. Large herbivores exhibit preferences for specific locations, such as near a water source, on gentle slopes, and in portions of the landscape known to be nutrient-rich (Bailey et al., 1996). Through the use of multiple subareas, APEX could be used to simulate different vegetation communities, soils, and slopes within a single pasture, but it does not yet include a mechanism for grazers to prefer, for instance, the B. gracilis that is growing on a 1% slope over the B. gracilis that is growing on a 30% slope. In addition, APEX operates at a spatial scale that does not permit the small scale dynamics of grazing at individual plant or feeding station levels. While it is technically feasible to add to APEX more complex grazing behavior, such as preference based on slopes, toxin satiation, and complementary effects of secondary compounds, such enhancements must be weighed against the price paid in model complexity and demands on the user to provide valid input data. For simulations whose objective is to evaluate relatively large-scale scale environmental (e.g. erosion) and production (e.g. grazing days ha\u22121) consequences, simulation of dietary toxin levels is probably unnecessary in most cases. 5.2 Stocking density Stocking density had little apparent effect on preference by grazers (Fig. 4), diet quality (Fig. 5), or nutrient excretion (Fig. 6). The minimal impact on selectivity was somewhat surprising, because we expected a high stocking density to reduce the amount of high quality forage available within a grazing season, forcing consumption of less preferred forages. The lack of this effect may have been caused by non-extreme stocking densities\u2014even under the highest stocking density, grazers were able to meet their full forage demand in most years. In addition, one of the three preferred species, B. gracilis, B. dactyloides, or P. smithii was usually available throughout the year. Long-term heavy stocking at this site caused most forages to disappear other than B. dactyloides, B. gracilis, and a small remnant population of P. smithii (Launchbaugh, 1967). All three are considered preferred species, but do not produce large quantities of biomass, particularly B. dactyloides and B. gracilis. Thus, although stocking density affected plant species composition in the historic field study, it changed aboveground biomass productivity more than it changed the availability of preferred forage. APEX simulations begin each year with the same plant populations. If APEX incorporated simulation of changing plant populations from one year to the next, some of these long-term dynamics might be captured, but would probably have little effect on diet quality at this site and during this grazing period (1 May to 1 Oct.), given the site\u2019s assemblage of palatable grasses that are also fairly grazing tolerant. The effect of stocking density on diet quality was also somewhat surprising. The heaviest stocking densities had slightly higher digestibility and CP concentration in the spring. This was the result of interaction between grazers and plant growth\u2014plants that were grazed produced regrowth. In the model, this is represented by a lesser overall stage of maturity in grazed species. Thus, heavier stocking kept plants at an earlier stage of development, on average. As with impact of stocking density on species selectivity, the result might have been different under a more extreme stocking density. That is to say, if forage supply of preferred forage was inadequate to meet demand, animals would be forced to eat more low quality (less preferred) forage during a particular grazing season, as long as sufficient quantities of less preferred forages were available. Lower digestibility and higher passage rate could limit intake. At the most extreme stocking densities, forage supply could be exhausted to the extent that forage intake was less than demand. Because nutrient excretion is directly tied to diet quality, excretion of nutrients followed intake of nutrients on an animal\u22121 basis. On an area basis (ha\u22121), both intake (Fig. 2) and excretion (data not shown) increased proportionately with stocking density. 6 Conclusions Upgrading the APEX model by incorporating selective grazing resulted in a change in species selection by grazers, overall diet quality, nutrient excretion, and standing vegetation residue. The differences between selective and na\u00efve grazers with respect to the aforementioned variables changed over the course of the grazing season, with greatest differences occurring early in the year. Generally speaking, diet preference followed expectations based on literature values; a C3 grass was preferred in the spring until it reached maturity, after which time C4 grasses were preferred. In autumn, the C3 perennial was once again the preferred forage. The model did not capture the short-lived preference for mature seeds of a C3 annual grass that was observed in some years in the field because APEX remains unable to distinguish grazers\u2019 preferences for different plant parts (e.g., leaves, stems, seeds, mast). This is a cost of minimizing user input requirements. Simulated diet quality was relatively insensitive to stocking density, although stocking density did impact standing vegetation residue. Urinary and fecal N excretion varied seasonally and interacted with weather-induced plant water stress. The revised model\u2019s ability to simulate differences in vegetation residue, diet quality, and nutrient excretion provide necessary building blocks to use or improve the model for the simulation of animal production, sediment erosion, water runoff, N and P runoff, and soil C accretion.

To determine the sensitivity of these changes on nutrient flows, vegetation responses, and grazer diet, we simulated the conditions of a 20-year historic grazing treatment conducted in Kansas, United States of America. Simulated scenarios were a factorial of 2 grazer types (na\u00efve and selective) and 3 stocking densities (high, medium, low). Na\u00efve grazers represented model behavior before our modifications. Selective grazers selected forage species based on crude protein content, digestibility, and anti-quality factors. We found that the new selective grazing algorithm resulted in a change in grazer diet quality, nutrient excretion, and standing vegetation residue. The difference between selective and na\u00efve grazers varied over the course of the grazing season, with greatest differences occurring early in the year. C3 grasses were generally preferred in the spring, after which time C4 grasses were preferred until autumn. Simulated diet quality was relatively insensitive to stocking density, although stocking density did impact standing vegetation residue. Urinary and fecal N excretion varied seasonally and interacted with weather-induced plant water stress. The revised model\u2019s ability to simulate differences in vegetation residue, diet quality, and nutrient excretion provide necessary building blocks to use or improve the model for the simulation of animal production, sediment erosion, water runoff, N and P runoff, and soil C accretion. The model\u2019s performance might be improved by tracking individual plant components (e.g. leaves, stems, seeds, mast), albeit at the cost of greater input requirements.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2018-12-24", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304380018303302", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zilverberg, Cody J."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Angerer, Jay"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Williams, Jimmy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Metz, Loretta J."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Harmoney, Keith"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304380018303302"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380018303302"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0304-3800(18)30330-2", "prism:volume": "390", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier B.V.", "dc:title": "Sensitivity of diet choices and environmental outcomes to a selective grazing algorithm", "prism:copyright": "\u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
