Abstract Run-time calibration, i.e. adjusting simulation results for field observations of model driving variables during run-time, may allow correcting for deviations between complex mechanistic simulation model results and actual field conditions. Leaf area index (LAI) and canopy nitrogen contents (LeafNWt) are the most important driving variables for these models, as they govern light interception and photosynthetic production capacity of the crop. Remote sensing may provide (spatial) data from which such information can be estimated. How, when and at what frequency such additional information is integrated in the simulation process may have various effects on the simulations. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of different run-time calibration scenarios for final grain yield (FGY) simulations in order to optimize remote sensing image (RS) acquisition. The PlantSys model was calibrated on LAI and LeafNWt for maize in France and used to simulate maize crop growth in the Argentina and the USA, for which non-destructive estimates of LAI and leaf chlorophyll contents were acquired by optical measurement techniques. Leaf chlorophyll data were used to estimate LeafNWt. Due to its structure, the PlantSys model was more susceptible to run-time calibration with LeafNWt than with LAI. Run-time calibration with LAI showed the largest effect on FGY before and around flowering, and could mainly be related to maintenance respiration costs. Run-time calibration with LeafNWt showed the largest effect on FGY at and after flowering and could mainly be related to the change in effective radiation interception due to change in leaf life. The accuracy of LAI estimates showed a major effect on FGY for underestimations but was small in absolute sense. The accuracy of LeafNWt estimates had significant impact at all crop development stages, but was the strongest after flowering where crop growth and nitrogen uptake are less able to recuperate from changes in LeafNWt. In absolute sense, the effect on FGY was as strong as the accuracy of the LeafNWt estimates when applied in the early reproductive stages. Based on these results it was concluded that remotely sensed in-field variability of LAI and LeafNWt is valuable information that can be used to spatially differentiate model simulations. Run-time calibration at sub-field level may lead to more accurate simulation results for whole fields. Keywords Simulation model Run-time calibration Remote sensing LAI Nitrogen Maize 1 Introduction Complex mechanistic crop growth simulation models are highly data-demanding and have to be calibrated locally to give accurate and reliable simulation results. Even if these requirements are met, simulation results may deviate from actual field observations for a variety of reasons. Especially when input data are difficult to measure accurately or expensive and laborious to collect, they are easily replaced by expert knowledge, inter- or extrapolated data and/or approximations that give reasonable simulation results, but may still deviate from actual field conditions. Run-time calibration, i.e. adjusting simulation results on the basis of field observations of model driving variables during simulation, allows corrections of such deviations. Such additional information about the crop\u2013soil system may come from classical field sampling methods, or may be derived from other techniques, such as remote sensing observations that would also directly reveal in-field variability of certain crop and soil characteristics in one overview. With a variable degree of success and at different spatial resolutions, remote sensing has been used to estimate crop and soil characteristics (Thenkabail et al., 2000), such as leaf area index (Clevers, 1989; Bouman, 1992), biomass (Turner et al., 2002), chlorophyll contents (Ma et al., 1996; Jago et al., 1999; Jongschaap and Booij, 2004), and evapotranspiration (Bastiaanssen et al., 2000). Best results are described for hyper-spectral imagery, however, these data are not always available, or are too expensive for use at high temporal resolution. Vegetation indices are often derived from observations in the visible domain and for satellite and airborne platforms cloud cover may interfere. Furthermore, high resolution and hyperspectral satellite sensors may have a low overpass frequency, further reducing the chance of obtaining images of the desired objects at regular intervals. Cloud cover is a minor problem for airborne observations that can take place upon request, but frequent flights may be restricted by environmental regulations. Observation frequency, interval, timing and accuracy of the data used in run-time calibration influence simulation results differentially. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of different run-time calibration scenarios on simulated final grain yield (FGY), to support optimization of remote sensing image acquisition and for predicting the effects of sub-optimal run-time calibration sets. Run-time calibration was performed with the PlantSys simulation model (Jongschaap, 1996; Jongschaap et al., 2002), applying five sequential optical sensing estimates (RS) in the course of the growing season of leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content. Leaf chlorophyll contents were used to calculate canopy nitrogen contents (LeafNWt). PlantSys was calibrated for maize growth in France (Jongschaap et al., 2002) and used for maize growth simulations in Argentina and the USA, for which estimates of LAI and leaf chlorophyll were acquired by non-destructive optical measurements techniques. The effects were analyzed of number of integrated RS observations (1\u20135) for run-time calibration, as well as their timing in the growing season, and of estimation accuracy of the input variables (95, 90, 75 and 60%) for run-time calibration on simulated FGYs. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Field experiments For model calibration, a field experiment with maize (Zea mays L.) was executed in 1999 at Avignon-Montfavet, France at 43\u00b057\u2032N and 4\u00b05\u2032E. Fertilizer (15-15-15) at 500kgha\u22121 was applied on 13 March 1999 (DoY 72), i.e. 75kgha\u22121 of the elements N, P and K. Variety DK-604 was sown at 0.8m between rows (oriented north\u2013south) and 0.115m between plants on 10 May 1999 (DoY 130) and emerged at a density of 9.32plantsm\u22122. In June and July 1999 the maize was irrigated (at a rate of 20mm) once a week and in August 1999 twice a week to restrict growth reduction due to drought stress. Plants were sampled every 5\u20137 days (18 times between 27 May and 7 October 1999) for determination of fresh and dry weight of leaves, stems and grains. Leaf area index (m2 m\u22122) was recorded just before sampling with LAI-2000 equipment (LI-COR Inc., USA). SPAD-meter (Minolta, USA) readings were taken on June 28 (DoY 178), July 23 (DoY 206) and September 16 (DoY 269). A SPAD-meter records leaf transmittance of an induced light beam in two wavelengths (\u00b1430 and \u00b1750nm). A direct relation between SPAD-meter readings and leaf nitrogen contents (LeafNWt, kgha\u22121 leaf) was used (Eq. (1); r 2 =0.92; Blackmer et al., 1994). (1) LeafNWt = \u2212 1.0244 + 0.0469 SPAD Additional experimental data were retrieved from maize experiments, originally designed to relate remote sensing observations to field observations, carried out under similar settings in 1997 and 1998 in \u2018Blue Earth\u2019 Minnesota (43\u00b045\u2032N, 94\u00b016\u2032W) in the USA, and in Pergamino (34\u00b007\u2032S, 60\u00b009\u2032W) and Pehuaro (36\u00b009\u2032S, 62\u00b058\u2032W) in Argentina. From these trials, information was available on planting and harvest dates, maize cultivars, fertilizer application (dates and rates), irrigation (dates and rates), and some information on soil characteristics. These data are further referred to as the \u2018EU Croma database\u2019, named after the project through which these data were made available (Croma, 2002). Five experimental sites from \u2018Blue Earth\u2019 (BLE), eight sites from Pergamino (PG) and six sites from Pehuaro (PH) provided data on leaf area index and chlorophyll contents at different crop development stages. Leaf SPAD measurements (Minolta) were related to leaf chlorophyll contents (LeafChl; \u03bcmolm\u22122 leaf; Eq. (2); r 2 =0.96; Markwell et al., 1995) and then converted to leaf nitrogen contents (LeafNWt, kgha\u22121 leaf; Eq. (3); r 2 =0.83; Ercoli et al., 1993). This two-step approach was needed because original SPAD values were no longer available in the EU Croma database. As a result, LeafNWt estimates may have been less accurate than LeafNWt estimates in the Avignon dataset. (2) LeafChl = 10 SPA D 0.265 (3) LeafNWt = \u2212 2.797 + 0.0188 LeafChl In this study, average values and standard deviations per plot and per observation date were generated. To study the effect of different run-time calibration frequencies and timing in the growing season, five observation dates were selected: two in the vegetative phase; one around tasseling/flowering; and two in the reproductive phase (Table 1 ). 2.2 Simulation model PlantSys 1.0 is a mechanistic simulation model (Jongschaap et al., 2002), consisting of algorithms based on knowledge of the underlying physical, physiological and biochemical processes that are described in individual modules that can, if required, be replaced by modules with different complexity. Plantsys 1.0 is a daily time-step model, and combines the Rotask simulation model (Jongschaap, 1996) and the crop growth and development approach of Yin et al. (2001) and Yin and van Laar (2005). PlantSys 1.0 is written in Fortran90, and runs in the Fortran Simulation Environment (Version 4) developed by van Kraalingen (1995). For fallow or field crop rotation systems, the model quantifies water fluxes (precipitation, irrigation, run-off, soil evaporation, transpiration and drainage) and nitrogen fluxes (soil organic nitrogen flows, i.e. mineralization/immobilisation, mineralization from crop residues, (in-)organic fertilisation, wet deposition, leaching and root nitrogen uptake by mass flow and diffusion). Light interception and thermal heat accumulation govern crop growth and development, respectively. Crop nitrogen contents may vary as a result of variations in nitrogen availability, resulting from mineralization, immobilization and fertiliser applications. Management decisions refer to ploughing (date, depth), incorporation of organic fertiliser (date, rate, type), and application of inorganic fertiliser (date, rate, type), sowing (rate, depth), irrigation (date, rate) and harvest (date, method). Crops currently included in the model are wheat, sugar beet, potato, barley, rape-seed and maize. For the current study, simulations were performed for maize only. Five categories of input data were used in the model: 1) Control data: Start day and year of simulation, end day and year of simulation, location, output variables. 2) Environmental data, i.e. meteorological input from local weather stations: Daily values of radiation, minimum and maximum temperature, vapour pressure, wind speed and precipitation and nitrogen concentration in precipitation. 3) Crop data: Crop type, initial (at emergence) values for LAI and organ dry weights, minimum, optimum and maximum nitrogen concentrations in various crop organs, temperature sums for phenological development stages (emergence, vegetative phase, reproductive phase), base temperatures for phenological development rates, maximum rooting depth and extinction coefficients for radiation. 4) Soil data: Soil moisture contents at specific suction (to specify soil moisture availability for different processes, such as uptake by plant roots and evaporation), soil organic matter pools (stable and labile), initial carbon and organic nitrogen contents, bulk density, initial inorganic nitrogen content. 5) Management data: Decision variables on ploughing, sowing/planting, organic and inorganic fertiliser application, irrigation and harvesting. Potential leaf photosynthesis rates are modelled with interactive effects of intercepted photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), CO2 levels, canopy nitrogen contents and canopy temperatures (Farquhar et al., 1980; Yin and van Laar, 2005). Potential leaf transpiration rates are coupled with potential photosynthesis rates via the Penman\u2013Monteith equation (Monteith, 1973; Yin and van Laar, 2005). Actual transpiration rates depend on the crop's ability to transpire water from the soil that enters the plant through the roots. Actual leaf photosynthesis rates are proportional to actual/potential transpiration rates. The intercepted PAR i depends on the incoming PAR0 and the extinction of PAR in the canopy depending on LAI according to Eq. (4), with k l =0.65 as PAR extinction coefficient for maize. (4) PA R i = PA R 0 ( 1 \u2212 e \u2212 k L LAI ) In Eq. (4), the effective (green) LAI results from leaf growth and leaf senescence processes. A vertical nitrogen distribution between a minimum leaf nitrogen concentration deeper in the canopy and a nitrogen extinction coefficient (k n =0.36; Jongschaap et al., 2002) determine which part of the LAI is effective for light interception. Any \u2018ineffective\u2019 LAI is directed towards the senescence pool (Yin et al., 2000; Yin and van Laar, 2005). This marks the importance of using LAI and LeafNWt for model run-time calibration for the Plantsys model. The same approach for PAR interception is used in various well-known models, e.g. APSIM (McCown et al., 1996), CERES (Tsuji et al., 1998; Eitzinger et al., 2004), DAISY (Svendsen et al., 1995), DSSAT (Porter and Jones, 1998; Gijsman et al., 2002), OPUS (Wegehenkel and Mirschel, 2005), STEP (Tracol et al., 2006), STICS (Beaujouan et al., 2001; Brisson et al., 2002), SUCROS (van Laar et al., 1997; van Ittersum et al., 2003) and WOFOST (Supit et al., 1994; Eitzinger et al., 2004). Output of the PlantSys model can be selected from all variables in the separate process modules. For the current study, final grain yield (kgha\u22121) was selected as dynamic crop growth simulation models are mostly used for yield predictions. 2.3 Model sensitivity analysis and model calibration The sensitivity analysis was tailored to the objective of predicting more accurate values over the growing season for leaf area index (m2 m\u22122), aerial biomass dry matter (ShootWt, kgha\u22121), canopy nitrogen contents (LeafNWt, kgha\u22121) and grain dry matter (GrainWt, kgha\u22121), for which field observations were available. In addition, two other variables are considered important, final grain yield (FGY, kgha\u22121) and total nitrogen uptake (TNUpt, kgha\u22121). As the EU Croma database contains values of leaf chlorophyll concentration (\u03bcgcm\u22122), canopy nitrogen content was derived from its chlorophyll content (Eq. (3); Markwell et al., 1995). Sensitivity or responsiveness was expressed as the \u2018elasticity\u2019 of output parameters: it is the change in the value of the output parameter per unit change in value of the input parameter, both expressed in percentages (Eq. (5)). Larger absolute values of the \u2018elasticity\u2019 indicate that model outcomes are more susceptible to changes in the input parameters. All model input parameters were varied by \u221210 and +10% (err=10%) and the elasticity of the selected model output parameters was calculated. The most sensitive input parameters were entered into the calibration procedure that consisted of an optimization procedure to minimize the deviation between simulation results and field measurements of leaf area index, grain weight and final grain weight (Hillyer et al., 2003). Values of the sensitive model input parameters were varied randomly over their biologically plausible range (BPR) until the combination with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) was found. After calibration on the detailed dataset of Avignon (1999), calibration was continued on the EU Croma database (for Argentina and the USA) to establish cultivar-specific values for the phenological characteristics base temperature (TempBase, \u00b0C), optimum temperature (TempOptim, \u00b0C), Temperature sum for the vegetative phase (TempSumVeg, degree-days) and temperature sum for the reproductive phase (TempSumGen, degree-days). Meteorological data from (nearby) weather stations were used to calculate temperature sums between sowing, emergence, flowering and maturity dates. 2.4 Run-time calibration procedures The model variables LAI and LeafNWt were used in run-time calibration, the most important drivers for dry matter production in the PlantSys model. Both variables influence interception of incoming radiation and hence photosynthesis rates and biomass production. During run-time calibration, simulated values of LAI and LeafNWt were replaced by estimates derived from optical measurement techniques, at maximally five dates during the growing season. Three run-time calibration aspects (A\u2013C) were considered in the analysis. \u2022 Aspect A: Number of remote sensing observations that was integrated. Run-time calibration was performed with 1\u20135 estimates for LAI and LeafNWt. \u2022 Aspect B: Timing of the run-time calibrations by varying the observation dates integrated in the run-time calibration procedure. All 32 possible combinations for 5 remote sensing dates were tested (Table 1). \u2022 Aspect C: The effect of under- and overestimation (5, 10, 25 and 40%) of LAI and LeafNWt that are used in the run-time calibration procedure. To evaluate the value of a specific remote sensing date (target date) in the run-time calibration procedure, the results of the scenarios were associated with weight factors that accounted for the number of remote sensing dates that were integrated, and for the distance between the target observation date and other observation dates in the specific scenario. An example may clarify the weight factor assignment: for target remote sensing date 1 (early vegetative stage), the scenario where only 1 remote sensing image was used (at date 1, obviously) obtained weigh factor 1.00. A scenario with N remote sensing observations (including the target date), obtained a weight factor of 1/N in the calculations. Additionally, the distance of the supplemental remote sensing dates (close by, or further away from the target date) was accounted for: scenarios with remote sensing dates next to the target date (at distance 1) obtained a weigh factor 1/2; at distance 2 it was 1/4; at distance 3 it was 1/8 and at distance 4 it was 1/16. Eventually, the cumulative effects were divided by the cumulative weight factors in order to average the impact of each remote sensing scenario per target date. As the PlantSys model was not designed to simulate the effect of disturbances (such as grazing, mowing, cutting or partial harvesting), a number of other model variables were adjusted in association with LAI adjustment: LeafWt, to maintain specific leaf weight (m2 leafg\u22121 leaf); StemWt, to maintain the leaf/stem ratio (gleafg\u22121 stem) and RootWt, to maintain the shoot/root ratio (gshootg\u22121 root). This approach was suggested by Boegh et al. (2004) and successfully applied by Jongschaap (2006). 3 Scenario simulations The PlantSys model was run for 32 remote sensing date combinations (frequencies), for 20 (synthetic) accuracy level combinations (ranging from \u221240 to +40%), for 3 calibration variables (LAI, LeafNWt and LAI+LeafNWt) and for a wide varieties of environmental conditions (18 plots in Argentina and the USA), resulting in 34,560 simulation runs. The output variable FGY was used to calculate E FGY (Eq. (5)) and its standard deviation. Standard deviation is calculated in the classical way, as the square root of the average squared deviation from the mean. Smaller standard deviations therefore imply that, in general, results are closer to the mean (less spread) and more stable. Larger (absolute) E FGY values indicate that model outcomes are more affected than at smaller (absolute) E FGY values. For the analysis of run-time calibration frequency (and timing), the effects were averaged over all synthetic accuracy scenarios (0, 5, 10, 25 and 40%). (5) E FGY = FG Y + err \u2212 FG Y \u2212 err FG Y err = 0 100 2 err With E FGY which is the elasticity (\u2013; unit less); FGYerr is the final grain yield (kgha\u22121) at accuracy level err (%) for remote sensing estimates of LAI and/or LeafNWt and err is the (synthetic) error in remote sensing estimate (0, 5, 10, 25 or 40%). For analysis of the underestimates (\u2212err) and overestimates (+err) in LAI and LeafNWt used in run-time calibration at different crop development stages, FGY results were compared with those from simulations where LAI and LeafNWt were accurately estimated (err=0). 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Model sensitivity analysis and calibration Table 2 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis using Eq. (5) (with err=10%). The model variables LAI (m2 m\u22122), LeafNWt (kgha\u22121), ShootWt (kgha\u22121) and GrainWt (kgha\u22121) were most sensitive to variations in soil moisture characteristics and in phenological characteristics. Soil moisture characteristics affect moisture availability to the crop, which is linearly related to dry matter production and phenological characteristics affect the duration of the vegetative and reproductive phases. These input parameters were either measured at the location, or could be estimated from secondary data for each site and cultivar, by taking into account soil texture, organic matter contents, emergence dates, flowering dates, maturity dates and meteorological data. The most sensitive input parameters (Table 3 ) were varied over their biologically plausible range (BPR) and were calibrated to field observations for Avignon (Fr). Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate simulated model results with field observations for Avignon (calibration) and Argentina/USA (validation). Both, LAI simulations (Fig. 1) and LeafNWt simulations (Fig. 2) gave satisfactory results with high correlation coefficients (r 2) and acceptable root mean square errors (RMSE). In the datasets, the standard deviations for field observations of LAI range from 0.2 to 0.7m2 m\u22122 and for approximations of LeafNWt from 0.5 to 5.0kgha\u22121. In general, LeafNWt seems to be slightly underestimated in the model, which may be due to the fact that the approximation between SPAD meter readings and LeafNWt (Eq. (1); Blackmer et al., 1994) could not be calibrated on the dataset, or that vertical nitrogen distribution may not be fully accounted for in leaf chlorophyll readings (Vleeshouwers and Jongschaap, 2001; Jongschaap and Booij, 2004). This study put emphasis on the relative effect of run-time calibration methods rather than considering absolute values. Therefore, these standard deviations will not have an important impact on the outcome of this study. 4.2 Run-time calibration frequency The frequency of remote sensing observations (1\u20135) of LAI and LeafNWt used in run-time calibration showed a distinct effect on E FGY (Fig. 3 ). LeafNWt calibrations showed a much stronger effect on E FGY than LAI calibrations and standard deviations for E FGY declined with increased remote sensing frequency. Run-time calibration for both, LAI and LeafNWt were positively correlated with E FGY. Run-time calibration on LAI showed a linear decline in E FGY with increasing remote sensing frequency, whereas run-time calibration on LeafNWt showed an increase in E FGY, but following the \u2018laws of diminishing returns\u2019. Increasing LeafNWt extends leaf life, which results in a prolonged period of light interception, especially in the last part (reproductive phase) of the maize growth cycle, and thus in higher grain yield. Higher LAI does not necessarily translates into higher production in the PlantSys model, as leaf nitrogen content and the vertical nitrogen distribution determine where in the canopy the incoming radiation is effectively intercepted. In the majority of the simulated cases, a change in LAI did not affect the light interception significantly, but it did influence the average amount of crop biomass that had to be maintained by the crop. A reduction of leaf biomass with a small penalty on light interception may result in more carbohydrates that are available for grain yield formation as fewer carbohydrates are needed for crop maintenance respiration. Likewise, an increase in leaf biomass showed, on average, no significant change in light interception, but increased the amount of carbohydrates that were respired through maintenance respiration. As a result, fewer carbohydrates were available for grain yield formation, which is expressed by the negative effect of LAI increase on E FGY. Calibrating both LAI and LeafNWt at the same time gave about the same results as a run-time calibration of LeafNWt alone. Between the variables, LeafNWt calibration has the largest effect on E FGY and therefore, run-time calibration with LAI+LeafNWt is omitted from further analyses. 4.3 Run-time calibration timing and accuracy This study also investigated the timing of run-time calibration (or choice of calibration date in the growing season) with LAI and LeafNWt. Results showed different remote sensing acquisition moments for realizing maximum effect on E FGY (Fig. 4 ). Run-time calibration with LAI maximally affected E FGY during the late vegetative stages and during tasseling/flowering, whereas run-time calibration with LeafNWt maximally affected E FGY during tasseling/flowering and the early reproductive stages. This means that the accuracy of the remote sensing estimates for LAI should be high in crop stages V7\u2013V9 and V9\u2013VT if these are used for run-time calibration. The highest accuracy for LeafNWt estimations is required in crop stages R1\u2013R2\u2013R3 and R4\u2013R5 if these are used for run-time calibration. The E FGY response curve of Fig. 4 showed an optimum (minimum or maximum, as run-time calibration takes place on driving variables that have a negative (LAI) or positive (LeafNWt) effect on simulated FGY) between the first and the last remote sensing image. The small effects in the early vegetative phase (V5\u2013V7) are explained by the fact that they relate to small absolute values of crop variables. Furthermore, crop performance in the early growth phases had relatively little effect on grain yield. Run-time calibration effects increase as the calibration date is shifted forwards until adjustment takes place too late to appreciably affect grain yield and eventually E FGY approaches 0. LeafNWt calibrations showed the largest effect on E FGY after tasseling/flowering (R1\u2013R2\u2013R3). Higher LeafNWt in this period increases light interception because of higher leaf nitrogen contents. Moreover, higher LeafNWt delays leaf senescence, as during the grain filling period, when nitrogen is translocated from vegetative organs to the grain, higher LeafNWt allows more withdrawal from the leaves without affecting their performance. Nitrogen uptake during this period is limited, because of low soil nitrogen levels. The accuracy (0, 5, 10, 25 and 40%) of the LAI and LeafNWt estimates used in run-time calibration differentially affects simulated FGY when applied at different crop development stages. For LAI, overestimated values in the beginning of the growth period result in lower FGY, and if applied after tasseling/flowering (R1\u2013R2\u2013R3), to slightly higher FGY (Fig. 5 ). Only severe underestimates of LAI (>25%) affect FGY significantly, because of reduced maintenance respiration costs and limited effects on light interception. The effect of run-time calibration with LAI (Fig. 5) is smaller than for run-time calibration with LeafNWt (Fig. 6 ). Underestimation of LeafNWt has a relatively stronger (negative) effect on simulated FGY than overestimation (positive). Surplus nitrogen may not be fully expressed in higher grain yield due to sink limitations. The crop can recover from nitrogen shortage, if it occurs in the early stages of crop development, but that is much more difficult, if it is imposed at later stages. The results in Figs. 5 and 6 show that the variability in LAI and LeafNWt applied at different crop development stages would result in differences in simulated FGY. For the PlantSys model, this might be significant for all LeafNWt observations and for LAI observations deviating more than 25% of the mean. These results enable to differentiate simulation runs for areas that are assumed to be homogeneous, such as a single crop on a single field with uniform management. The remote sensing observations may expose within-field variability in crop performance as a result of abiotic stress and/or biotic interference (such as pests and diseases). The variability in crop performance due to biotic stresses often fall outside the model boundaries, whereas abiotic stresses at sub-plot level, for instance the (un-)availability of water and nutrients, are often disregarded for practical reasons, such as the costs and time requirements for soil sampling. Accurate methods have been reported for the quantitative assessment of LAI and LeafNWt from remote sensing observations obtained from different platforms (Jago et al., 1999; Broge and Leblanc, 2000; Thenkabail et al., 2000; Broge and Mortensen, 2002; Jongschaap and Booij, 2004). At an appropriate spatial and spectral resolution, these methodologies can be used to observe in-field variability in LAI and LeafNWt, that might be the result of soil processes and stresses not incorporated in the model. By using these data for run-time calibration of a mechanistic simulation model, they allow spatially differentiating the model, which might result in more accurate predictions of FGY. For such an application, remote sensing pixels that belong to a specific agricultural field should be classified in such a way that simulated FGY will give significantly different values. Classification should be done by quantitative assessment of LAI and LeafNWt. The results of our study indicate that pixels with an LAI deviating more than 25% of the mean, and pixels with LeafNWt deviating more than 10% from the mean, should be grouped and used for run-time calibration at sub-field level, especially at the early reproductive stage (R1\u2013R2\u2013R3). 5 Conclusions The most important conclusions from our analysis of the effects of different run-time calibration scenarios of a mechanistic simulation model with LAI and LeafNWt, obtained from remote sensing observations, on simulated final grain yield of maize, are: \u2022 Depending on the major controlling variable for radiation interception in the model, LAI or LeafNWt should be used for run-time calibration. The effect of the two variables on simulated final grain yield is different. \u2022 A positive correlation was found between remote sensing frequency and the effect on simulated final grain yield. Run-time calibration on LAI negatively affects FGY with a maximum elasticity of \u22120.15. The negative effect is the result of the change in maintenance respiration costs that is stronger than the change in radiation interception. For calibration on LeafNWt the effect follows the \u2018law of diminishing returns\u2019, with a maximum elasticity of 0.60. Remote sensing frequency has a negative correlation with the variability in simulated final grain yield, i.e. higher observation frequency leads to more stable results. \u2022 If a time-series of remote sensing images is not affordable for estimation of LAI and/or LeafNWt, preference should be given to acquiring images around the start of the reproductive phase as run-time calibration during that time interval has the strongest influence on simulated final grain yield. \u2022 If the accuracy of LAI or LeafNWt estimates (represented as err in this study) is interpreted as two-dimensional variability in the LAI or LeafNWt in a remote sensing image, and when used in run-time calibration, it results in different simulated final grain yield in a spatial grid. This result indicates that spatial assessment of a point-based simulation model is possible.

Leaf area index (LAI) and canopy nitrogen contents (LeafNWt) are the most important driving variables for these models, as they govern light interception and photosynthetic production capacity of the crop. Remote sensing may provide (spatial) data from which such information can be estimated. How, when and at what frequency such additional information is integrated in the simulation process may have various effects on the simulations. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of different run-time calibration scenarios for final grain yield (FGY) simulations in order to optimize remote sensing image (RS) acquisition. The PlantSys model was calibrated on LAI and LeafNWt for maize in France and used to simulate maize crop growth in the Argentina and the USA, for which non-destructive estimates of LAI and leaf chlorophyll contents were acquired by optical measurement techniques. Leaf chlorophyll data were used to estimate LeafNWt. Due to its structure, the PlantSys model was more susceptible to run-time calibration with LeafNWt than with LAI. Run-time calibration with LAI showed the largest effect on FGY before and around flowering, and could mainly be related to maintenance respiration costs. Run-time calibration with LeafNWt showed the largest effect on FGY at and after flowering and could mainly be related to the change in effective radiation interception due to change in leaf life. The accuracy of LAI estimates showed a major effect on FGY for underestimations but was small in absolute sense. The accuracy of LeafNWt estimates had significant impact at all crop development stages, but was the strongest after flowering where crop growth and nitrogen uptake are less able to recuperate from changes in LeafNWt. In absolute sense, the effect on FGY was as strong as the accuracy of the LeafNWt estimates when applied in the early reproductive stages. Based on these results it was concluded that remotely sensed in-field variability of LAI and LeafNWt is valuable information that can be used to spatially differentiate model simulations. Run-time calibration at sub-field level may lead to more accurate simulation results for whole fields.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2007-01-10", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304380006003450", "dc:creator": {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Jongschaap, Raymond E.E."}, "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304380006003450"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380006003450"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0304-3800(06)00345-0", "prism:volume": "200", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier B.V.", "dc:title": "Sensitivity of a crop growth simulation model to variation in LAI and canopy nitrogen used for run-time calibration", "prism:copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.
