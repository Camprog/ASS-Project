Abstract Diverging junctions are an important type of bottlenecks, which can reduce capacities and initiate and propagate traffic congestion in a road network. In this paper, we propose a kinematic wave theory for modeling dynamics of non-cooperative diverging traffic, in which traffic dynamics of vehicles to one direction are assumed to be independent of those to other directions instantaneously. During a short time interval, the kinematic wave model of diverging traffic is decoupled into a number of nonlinear resonant systems. From analytical solutions to the Riemann problem of a decoupled system, a new definition of partial traffic demand is introduced, so that diverging flows can be easily computed with the supply\u2013demand method. Then a Cell Transmission Model is proposed to solve the kinematic wave model of diverging traffic by taking into account of the interactions among different traffic streams. Simulation results demonstrate that vehicles follow the First-In-First-Out principle in the long run, and the model converges when we decrease the cell and time-step sizes. In addition, it is shown that traffic streams to different directions segregate in a selfish manner, and the total throughput of a diverging junction is not maximized as in existing diverge models. In the future, more theoretical and empirical studies are needed for a better understanding of this and other diverge models. Keywords Non-cooperative diverging traffic Kinematic wave models Nonlinear resonant systems Partial traffic demand First-In-First-Out principle Cell Transmission Model 1 Introduction Diverges have been well recognized as a major type of bottlenecks (Daganzo, 1999; Daganzo et al., 1999), where congestion of one downstream branch can propagate to the upstream branch and further blocks vehicles traveling to other directions. In Daganzo (1996), it was shown that queues from downstream freeways can reduce off-ramp flows and lead to total gridlock of a beltway network; in Jin and Zhang (2005) and Jin (2009), the interactions between merging and diverging bottlenecks were identified as the cause of oscillatory traffic patterns in a simple road network. In Cassidy et al. (2002), it was shown that stop-and-go traffic on the exit lane can slow down passing vehicles and create an active bottleneck near an off-ramp. In Ahn et al. (2010), observations and theoretical analyses demonstrated that the magnitude of traffic oscillations tends to grow when they pass a diverging off-ramp. To mitigate the bottleneck effect of diverging bottlenecks has been the goal of many traffic control and management strategies. In Li et al. (2009) and G\u00fcnther et al. (2012), strategies to remove queues on off-ramps were proposed to increase mainline freeways\u2019 throughput. In Papageorgiou and Kotsialos (2002) and Cassidy (2003), it was argued that, by alleviating traffic congestion on mainline freeways, well-designed ramp metering algorithms can avoid the starvation of off-ramps and increase outflows of a network. In addition, congestion dynamics at diverging junctions are important for emergency evacuations (Sheffi et al., 1982) and route guidance (Papageorgiou, 1990). Observations of diverging traffic (Mu\u00f1oz and Daganzo, 2000, 2002) have shown that vehicles to different downstream branches tend to segregate themselves at a point, called the actual diverging point, as far as 2km upstream of the physical diverging point. In addition, traffic upstream of the actual diverging point is in the so-called \u201c1-pipe\u201d regime in the sense that vehicles that appear at the same time and location have the same speed even they have different destinations; while between the actual and physical diverging points traffic is in a \u201c2-pipe\u201d regime, since vehicles to different directions are separated and travel independently. In certain cases, however, the actual and physical diverging points may be the same (Newell, 1999). Although it is an important and interesting problem to determine the location of an actual diverging point, here we only intend to study traffic dynamics at an actual diverging point or simply a highway diverge; i.e., we want to know, under certain traffic conditions, how much traffic will flow into each downstream branch. In the literature, microscopic (Hidas, 2005) and higher-order continuum models (Liu et al., 1996) have been proposed for diverging traffic flows. However, they are too complicated to be mathematically tractable. Due to its simplicity in representation and efficiency in computation, the kinematic wave theory developed by Lighthill and Whitham (1955) and Richards (1956) has played an important role in understanding traffic dynamics on road networks. Within the framework of the kinematic wave theory, there have been two major lines of research on diverging traffic flow models. In the first line of research, the effect of diverging traffic to the mainline freeway is incorporated by considering an off-ramp as a sink (Kuhne and Michalopoulos, 1992). In these models, however, only a side of the interaction between the diverging traffic and the main highway traffic, i.e., the impact of diverging traffic to the mainline traffic, is taken into account. In addition, the characteristics of sinks are not trivial to obtain. In contrast, in the second line of research, the complete dynamics at diverges are studied by treating each branch equally. When vehicles do not have predefined routes and can choose any downstream branches at a diverge during evacuation periods, Holden and Risebro (1995) determined the flow to each branch by solving an optimization problem, and Jin and Zhang (2003b) proposed a distribution scheme based on the definitions of traffic supply and demand. For more general situations when vehicles have predefined route choices, within the framework of Cell Transmission Models, Daganzo (1995) and Lebacque (1996) proposed the so-called supply\u2013demand method for computing traffic flows through a diverge. In this method, each branch is partitioned into a number of cells, and a duration of time is discretized into time steps. Then a diverge connects an upstream cell and a number of downstream cells, and the flow to a downstream cell during a time period is assumed to be proportional to the fraction of vehicles in the upstream cell that wish to travel to this downstream cell. In addition, the flows to the downstream cells are assumed to reach their maxima subject to the constraint of traffic demand of the upstream cell and supplies of the downstream cells. In Jin (2010), kinematic waves arising from several diverge models based on supply\u2013demand method, in which vehicles can have predefined routes or not, were analyzed. However, existing kinematic wave models of diverging traffic are usually based on the assumption that the total flux through a diverge is maximized but do not provide any insights into how traffic streams segregate from each other. In this paper, we intend to propose a scheme for instantaneous decoupling of traffic streams at a diverge. First we partition each branch into a number of cells and discretize a duration of time into time steps. Further in a (short) time step, 1 The length of this \u201cshort\u201d time step \u0394t, theoretically, can be infinitely small. 1 we compute the in-flow to a downstream branch by holding traffic conditions of vehicles to the other destinations constant in the upstream cell and, after obtaining all flows, update traffic conditions in all the upstream and downstream cells. We can see that, in this theory, dynamics of traffic traveling to different destinations are first decoupled during a short time period and then combined together in the long run. With this decoupling scheme, we can obtain a hyperbolic system of conservation laws for traffic to each downstream branch, which is independent of the systems corresponding to the other downstream branches. In this sense, a traffic stream attempts to maximize its throughput regardless of the dynamics of other traffic streams, and the diverging behavior is non-cooperative instantaneously. Moreover, we will show that the decoupled systems are nonlinear resonant systems in the sense of Isaacson and Temple (1992) and can be solved by combinations of shock, rarefaction, and standing waves. Here, these waves are considered instantaneous since they only exist in a short time interval, and waves corresponding to different downstream branches interact with each other at the end of each time interval. Thus, after a long time, the asymptotic kinematic waves arising from diverging traffic could be totally different from the instantaneous waves. In this paper, we will focus on the instantaneous waves arising from each branch, and interactions among these waves and asymptotic kinematic waves in diverge networks are subject to future studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, with a new definition of upstream partial demands, boundary fluxes can still be calculated with the supply\u2013demand method. Mathematically, we present a new decoupling approach to solve complicated traffic dynamics at diverging junctions. To the best of our knowledge, this decoupling approach is the first of its kind in solving network kinematic wave models. Physically, we propose a new macroscopic diverging rule, in which vehicles to different directions segregate from each other in a selfish manner. This rule is different from that in Daganzo (1995) and Lebacque (1996), in which vehicles to different directions try to collaborate with each other so as to maximize the total throughput. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we first formulate a path-based kinematic wave theory of diverges, which can be considered as 2\u00d72 systems of hyperbolic conservation laws with coupled and discontinuous fundamental diagrams, and introduce the instantaneous kinematic wave theory for dynamics of diverging traffic. In Section 3, we solve in detail for the instantaneous kinematic waves. In Section 4, we present a new definition of traffic demand for diverging vehicles and the supply\u2013demand method based on this new definition and compare the new model with existing ones. In Section 5, we carry out simulations of the new model for two cases and discuss convergence and other properties of the model. In Section 6, we make our conclusions and propose some follow-up research. 2 A kinematic wave theory for diverges As we know, in a traffic stream, traffic dynamics can be affected by such characteristics as vehicle types and destinations and drivers\u2019 behaviors. Here vehicles of the same characteristics are considered to belong to a commodity. In this study we are only interested in the impact of vehicles\u2019 destinations on traffic dynamics at a highway diverge. Therefore, for a diverge with D downstream branches and one upstream branch, we can differentiate vehicles into D commodities. Here we label the upstream link by 0, and downstream links by 1,\u2026, D. Here we consider an ideal diverge: on the upstream branch, traffic is considered in 1-pipe regime in the sense of Daganzo (1997); once through the diverge, vehicles completely segregate. Therefore, we have a D-commodity flow on the upstream link and a single-commodity flow on each downstream link, and traffic dynamics on a road network with a diverge comprise three parts: dynamics of the single-commodity flow on each downstream branch, dynamics of the D-commodity flow on the upstream branch, and dynamics at the diverge. In the following part, after reviewing the kinematic wave models of single-commodity and D-commodity traffic, we will focus on the study of traffic dynamics at the diverge. 2.1 The kinematic wave theory of single-commodity traffic flow For dynamics of single-commodity traffic on a downstream link i (i =1,\u2026, D), the seminal LWR (Lighthill and Whitham, 1955; Richards, 1956) kinematic wave theory can be applied. In the LWR model for traffic flow on a long crowded road, two equations are used to describe traffic dynamics of aggregate quantities such as traffic density \u03c1 i , flow-rate q i and travel speed v i : (1a) Traffic conservation : \u2202 \u03c1 i \u2202 t + \u2202 q i \u2202 x = 0 , (1b) Fundamental diagram : q i = Q i ( a , \u03c1 i ) . In (1b), a(x) is an inhomogeneity factor depending on road characteristics such as the number of lanes at x. Since q i = \u03c1 i v i , we also have a speed\u2013density relation on link i: v i = V i (a, \u03c1 i )= Q i (a, \u03c1 i )/\u03c1 i ; for vehicular traffic, generally, travel speed is non-increasing, and the equilibrium flow-density relation is assumed to be concave. From (1a) and (1b), the LWR model can be written as (2) \u2202 \u03c1 i \u2202 t + \u2202 \u03c1 i V i ( a , \u03c1 i ) \u2202 x = 0 . When the road is homogeneous; i.e., a(x) is constant, the LWR model is called homogeneous; otherwise, when a(x) is dependent on location, (2) is called an inhomogeneous LWR model. The homogeneous LWR model is nothing but a scalar conservation law and has been well studied both analytically and numerically. It is solved by combinations of shock and expansion (rarefaction) waves. In contrast, the inhomogeneous LWR model (2) can be considered as a nonlinear resonant system and has an additional type of kinematic waves-standing waves, which initiate and stay at the inhomogeneity (Jin and Zhang, 2003a). Therefore, for a single-commodity flow on a road branch, traffic dynamics can be considered as the evolution of a combination of shock, rarefaction, and standing waves. 2.2 The kinematic wave theory of multi-commodity traffic flow For traffic on the upstream link 0, it is assumed that vehicles with different destinations have no differences in dynamics; i.e., the speed\u2013density relation is independent of commodities. In addition, we assume that all lanes are the same and can be used by all commodities. That is, we have single-class and single-lane-group traffic on the upstream link. Let \u03c1 i (x, t), v i (x, t), and q i (x, t) (i =1,\u2026, D) denote, at place x on link 0 and time t, the density, speed, and flow-rate of commodity i, respectively. In contrast, \u03c1 0(x, t), v 0(x, t), and q 0(x, t) are the aggregate density, speed, and flow-rate. Then we have (with (x, t) suppressed hereafter) \u03c1 0 = \u2211 i = 1 D \u03c1 i , v 0 = v i = V 0 ( a , \u03c1 0 ) , i = 1 , \u2026 , D , q 0 = \u2211 i = 1 D q i , where q 0 = \u03c1 0 v 0, q i = \u03c1 i v i (i =1,\u2026, D), V 0(a, \u03c1 0) is the aggregate speed\u2013density relation. We also call this kind of multi-commodity traffic as additive. In additive traffic, the flow of each commodity is called a partial flow and the flow containing all commodities the total flow. Therefore, in additive traffic, dynamics of each partial flow on the upstream link can be written as (3) \u2202 \u03c1 i \u2202 t + \u2202 \u03c1 i V 0 ( a , \u03c1 0 ) \u2202 x = 0 , i = 1 , \u2026 , D , which is a D \u00d7 D system of hyperbolic conservation laws with D equations and D unknown variables. Note that these D equations are coupled through the aggregate speed\u2013density relation, and the flux functions \u03c1 i V 0(a, \u03c1 0) could be discontinuous, caused by the inhomogeneity factor a(x). Moreover, (3) can be viewed as a Temple system (Temple, 1982), for which the aggregate traffic dynamics can be described by the (inhomogeneous) LWR model and is still solved by a combination of shock waves, rarefaction waves, and/or standing waves, and traffic dynamics of a commodity have a similar pattern. By introducing the fraction of vehicles of commodity i, \u03be i = \u03c1 i /\u03c1 0, which satisfies \u2211 i = 1 D \u03be i = 1 , Lebacque (1996) showed that traffic dynamics of additive traffic can also be written as (4a) ( \u03c1 0 ) t + ( \u03c1 0 V 0 ( a , \u03c1 0 ) ) x = 0 , (4b) ( \u03be i ) t + V 0 ( a , \u03c1 0 ) ( \u03be i ) x = 0 , i = 1 , \u2026 , D - 1 . We can see that the fractions travel in the same speed as vehicles. This shows that the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle is guaranteed in the kinematic wave theory of additive traffic (Lebacque, 1996). 2.3 A kinematic wave theory of diverging traffic In this subsection we combine the single-commodity model for the downstream branches (Section 2.1) and the multi-commodity model for the upstream branch (Section 2.2) into a model for the diverging traffic. For partial flow i (i =1,\u2026, D), we introduce a coordinate x i and set the diverging point at x i =0 and vehicles travel in the positive direction of x i -axis. Thus, x i <0 for the upstream link and x i >0 for the downstream link. Then by combining (3) and (2) we can have the following path-based kinematic wave model of diverging traffic flow: (i =1,\u2026, D) (5a) \u2202 \u03c1 i \u2202 t + \u2202 \u03c1 i U i ( x i , a ( x i ) , \u03c1 1 , \u2026 , \u03c1 D ) \u2202 x i = 0 , which can be considered a D \u00d7 D system of hyperbolic conservation laws. In the new system, the flux functions, i.e., the fundamental diagrams, are discontinuous since the corresponding speed\u2013density relations are discontinuous: (i =1,\u2026, D) (5b) U i ( x i , a ( x i ) , \u03c1 1 , \u2026 , \u03c1 D ) = V 0 ( x i , a ( x i ) , \u03c1 1 + \u22ef + \u03c1 D ) , x i < 0 , V i ( x i , a ( x i ) , \u03c1 i ) , x i > 0 . In a sense, the kinematic wave model, (5), can be considered as an extended Temple system of non-strictly hyperbolic conservation laws on a network. For x i <0 or x i >0, (5) becomes the LWR model for a link and can be solved both analytically and numerically. The remaining task to solve traffic dynamics at x i =0, where traffic streams on all links are coupled together. In Daganzo (1995), (5) is numerically solved by the Godunov method, in which links are discretized into cells and a time duration is divided into a number of time steps. At each time step, a cell\u2019s demand and supply are defined as its maximum sending and receiving flow-rates, respectively; the boundary fluxes through the diverge are calculated from the upstream cell\u2019s demand, turning proportions, and downstream cells\u2019 supplies by assuming that vehicles follow the FIFO principle and the total throughput is maximized. In contrast, in Lebacque (1996), partial demands in the cell upstream to the diverge are defined, and the flux to each downstream cell equals the minimum of the corresponding partial demand and the downstream supply. In Jin (2010), it was shown that Lebacque\u2019s diverge model is consistent with Daganzo\u2019s in the continuous solutions; that is, in both models, vehicles\u2019 macroscopic diverging behaviors are assumed to follow the FIFO and maximum throughput rules. In Holden and Risebro (1995) and Coclite et al. (2005), (5) was solved analytically, but with entropy conditions, for which the underlying diverging rules are not well understood. Even though the boundary flux functions in Daganzo (1995) and Lebacque (1996) and the entropy conditions in Holden and Risebro (1995) and Coclite et al. (2005) are sufficient to determine unique solutions to (5), it is not clear how the diverge models are derived from different diverging rules. Since in reality drivers may diverge in different manners, which can lead to more realistic patterns in the formation, propagation, and dissipation of queues in the network, it is worthwhile to look into the underlying segregation mechanism of different commodities, which could lead to better diverge models. In this study, we propose a discrete kinematic wave theory, in which a new mechanism is proposed for traffic segregation in a diverge network. Here we partition each branch into a number of cells of length \u0394 x, discretize the time duration into time steps of length \u0394t, and assume that the aggregate and partial traffic densities are constant in each cell at a time step. The discretization of space\u2013time plane in this model is required to satisfy the CFL condition (Courant et al., 1928), which guarantees that the flows through the diverge are only dependent on traffic densities in the adjacent cells and are independent of traffic conditions farther upstream or downstream. Connected to the diverge with D downstream branches are an upstream cell and D downstream cells, denoted as downstream cell i (i =1,\u2026, D). Assume that, at t =0, partial densities in the upstream cell are \u03c1 i L and the aggregate density \u03c1 L = \u2211 i = 1 D \u03c1 i L , and density in downstream cell i is \u03c1 i R . Then from t =0 to t =\u0394t, we assume that traffic dynamics of different commodities are independent. That is, when solving (5) for commodity i during [0, \u0394t], we hold partial densities of vehicles of the other commodities in the upstream cell constant during this time interval. That is, \u03c1 j L , where j =1,\u2026, D and j \u2260 i, are all constant during the time interval. To simplify the notations, we rewrite \u03c1 i as \u03c1 and the total traffic densities of other commodities as k. Since k is held constant during the time interval [0, \u0394t], and k =0 in downstream cell i, (5) can be re-written as: (6) \u03c1 t + ( \u03c1 V ( a ( x ) , \u03c1 + k ) ) x = 0 , with the following initial traffic conditions (7) \u03c1 = \u03c1 L x < 0 , \u03c1 R x > 0 ; t = 0 , k = k L x < 0 , 0 x > 0 ; t \u2208 [ 0 , \u0394 t ] . Here we extend our x-axis to both positive and negative infinity since, with the CFL condition, the traffic dynamics only depend on the conditions above. Thus, (6) with (7) is a description of traffic dynamics of commodity i during a short time interval. This new model will be shown to be solved by instantaneous kinematic waves in the following section. 3 The instantaneous kinematic waves In this section, we discuss the instantaneous kinematic waves of (6) with initial conditions (7). Note that the model is valid only during a short time interval, and the instantaneous kinematic waves arising from traffic streams to different directions interact with each other in the upstream link. For the purpose of exposition, we here assume that both the upstream and downstream branches share the same speed\u2013density relation; i.e., we exclude the road characteristics a(x) in (6). We also assume that q is concave and v non-increasing in \u03c1 \u2208[0, \u03c1 j ], where \u03c1 j is the jam density for the whole link. With modifications, the results here are applicable to the case when the upstream and downstream branches have different characteristics. Since we assume that k is time independent, we have another conservation equation: k t =0. Therefore (6) with (7) can be rewritten as a 2\u00d72 system: (8) \u03c1 t + ( \u03c1 V ( \u03c1 + k ) ) x = 0 , k t = 0 , together with initial conditions (9) \u03c1 ( x , t = 0 ) = \u03c1 L x < 0 , \u03c1 R x > 0 , k ( x , t = 0 ) = k L x < 0 , 0 x > 0 . Next, we will show that (8) is a nonlinear resonant system studied by Isaacson and Temple (1992). Consequently, we can use their technique to solve this system, which describes traffic dynamics of one commodity during a short time period. Note that here we do not restrict our time domain to be [0, \u0394t]. This is because (8) with (9) has self-similar solutions, which means that the flow f(x =0, t) is constant for any time t >0. 3.1 The properties of (8) as a nonlinear resonant system Denote the state U =(k, \u03c1), the flux vector F(U)=(0, \u03c1V(\u03c1 + k)), (8) can be written as a hyperbolic system of conservation laws: (10) U t + F ( U ) x = 0 , where x \u2208(\u2212\u221e, \u221e), t \u2a7e0. This system can be written in the following form of a quasi-linear system (11) U t + \u2202 F ( U ) U x = 0 , where the Jacobian matrix \u2202F(U) is (12) \u2202 F = 0 0 \u03c1 V \u2032 ( \u03c1 + k ) V ( \u03c1 + k ) + \u03c1 V \u2032 ( \u03c1 + k ) . Thus the two eigenvalues of \u2202F(U) are \u03bb 0 = 0 , \u03bb 1 = V ( \u03c1 + k ) + \u03c1 V \u2032 ( \u03c1 + k ) , and their corresponding right eigenvectors are R \u2192 0 = V ( \u03c1 + k ) + \u03c1 V \u2032 ( \u03c1 + k ) - \u03c1 V \u2032 ( \u03c1 + k ) , R \u2192 1 = 0 1 . System (10) is a non-strictly hyperbolic system, since it may happen that for some U \u2217 (13) \u03bb 0 ( U \u2217 ) = \u03bb 1 ( U \u2217 ) = 0 . When (13) is satisfied, we say that traffic state U \u2217 is partially critical. If denoting the partial fundamental diagram as Q ( \u03c1 ; k ) = \u03c1 V ( \u03c1 + k ) , we can define other partial quantities of the commodity that we are interested in, partial capacity Q max(k) and partial critical density \u03b3(k), as follows: (14) Q ( \u03c1 ; k ) \u2a7d Q max ( k ) , \u2200 \u03c1 \u2208 [ 0 , \u03c1 j - k ] , (15) Q max ( k ) = Q ( \u03b3 ( k ) ; k ) . Since V\u2032\u2a7d0 and d 2(\u03c1V(\u03c1))/d\u03c1 2 <0, we have \u2202 2 Q ( \u03c1 ; k ) \u2202 \u03c1 2 < 0 , \u2202 Q ( \u03c1 ; k ) \u2202 k \u2a7d 0 . Therefore, Q max(k) and \u03b3(k) are unique for given k \u2208[0, \u03c1 j ]. Thus the partially critical state U \u2217 =(k \u2217, \u03c1 \u2217)=(k \u2217, \u03b3(k \u2217)) for given k \u2217. We call the collection of all partially critical states, \u0393 ={U \u2217\u2223k \u2208[0, \u03c1 j ]}, the transition curve. Moreover, at a partially critical state U \u2217, (8) is genuinely nonlinear; i.e., (16) \u2202 \u2202 \u03c1 \u03bb 1 ( U \u2217 ) = \u2202 2 \u2202 \u03c1 2 ( \u03c1 V ( \u03c1 + k ) ) < 0 , since q = \u03c1V(\u03c1 + k) is concave in \u03c1, and \u2202F(U) is nondegenerate; i.e., (17) \u2202 \u2202 k ( \u03c1 \u2217 V ( \u03c1 \u2217 + k \u2217 ) ) = \u03c1 \u2217 V \u2032 ( \u03c1 \u2217 + k \u2217 ) = - V ( \u03c1 \u2217 + k \u2217 ) < 0 . With conditions (13)\u2013(17) satisfied, (8) is a nonlinear resonant system in the sense of Isaacson and Temple (1992), and it is guaranteed that, in a neighborhood of the state U \u2217, the Riemann problem for (8) with (9) has a unique solution with a canonical structure. 3.2 The instantaneous kinematic waves of (8) with (9) The Riemann problem for (8) with initial conditions (9) is solved by two families of basic waves, associated with the two eigenvalues. The 0-waves with wave speed \u03bb 0 =0, also called standing waves, are the integral curves of R \u2192 0 in U-space, and therefore are given by Q(\u03c1; k)=const. Similarly, the 1-waves with wave speed \u03bb 1(U) are integral curves of R \u2192 1 in U-space, and are given by k =const. As shown in Fig. 1 , the 0-curve is concave and tangent to the 1-curve at the critical state U \u2217; states left to the transition wave \u0393(k) are under-critical (UC), and over-critical (OC) right to the transition wave. Isaacson and Temple (1992) showed that wave solutions to the Riemann problem are formed by no more than three basic waves, including standing waves, shock waves, and rarefaction waves, and these waves satisfy two entropy conditions: Lax\u2019s entropy condition (Lax, 1972), i.e., that these waves increase their wave speeds from left (upstream) to right (downstream), and an additional condition that an UC state and an OC state cannot be connected by a standing wave. With these conditions, wave solutions exist and are unique: when U L is UC, wave solutions in U-space are shown in Fig. 2 , and in Fig. 4 when U L is OC. Note that the solutions can also be categorized according to whether \u03c1 R is OC or UC. Also recall that U R always lies on k =0. In the remaining part of this subsection, we will discuss the Riemann solutions of (8) with (9), and compute the boundary flux q(x =0, t). 1. When U L is UC; i.e., \u03c1 L < \u03b3(k L ), we denote the intersection between Q(U L ) and k =0 by \u03c1 1 and \u03c1 2, where \u03c1 1 \u2a7d \u03b3(0)\u2a7d \u03c1 2. Hence, we obtain three types of solutions when \u03c1 R \u2208[0, \u03c1 1], (\u03c1 1, \u03c1 2), or [\u03c1 2, \u03c1 j ] as shown in Fig. 2. Type 1 When \u03c1 R \u2208[0, \u03c1 1]; i.e., Q(\u03c1 R ; 0)\u2a7d Q(U L ) and U R is UC, the wave solutions to the Riemann problem consist of two basic waves with the intermediate state, U 1 =(\u03c1 1, 0): the left wave (U L , U 1) is a standing wave, and the right wave (U 1, U R ) is a rarefaction wave with a characteristic velocity \u03bb 1(U)>0. As shown in Fig. 3 , the boundary flux q(x =0, t >0)= Q(U L ). Type 2 When \u03c1 R \u2208(\u03c1 1, \u03c1 2); i.e., Q(\u03c1 R ; 0)> Q(U L ), the wave solutions to the Riemann problem consist of two basic waves with the intermediate state, U 1 =(\u03c1 1, 0): the left wave (U L , U 1) is a standing wave, and the right wave (U 1, U R ) is a shock wave with a positive wave speed s(U 1, U R )=(Q(\u03c1 R ; 0)\u2212 Q(U L ))/(\u03c1 R \u2212 \u03c1 1). In this case, the boundary flux q(x =0, t >0)= Q(U L ). Note that the kinematic wave solutions of Types 2 to 3 are similar to that in Fig. 3 and omitted. Type 3 When \u03c1 R \u2208[\u03c1 2, \u03c1 j ]; i.e., Q(\u03c1 R ; 0)\u2a7d Q(U L ) and U R is OC, the wave solutions to the Riemann problem consist of two basic waves with the intermediate state, U 1 =(\u03c1 1, \u03c1 L ) and Q(U 1)= Q(\u03c1 R ; 0): the left wave (U L , U 1) is a shock wave with a negative wave speed s(U L , U 1)=(Q(U L )\u2212 Q(U 1))/(\u03c1 L \u2212 \u03c1 1), and the right wave (U 1, U R ) is a standing wave. In this case, the boundary flux q(x =0, t >0)= Q(U R ). 2. When U L is OC; i.e., \u03c1 L > \u03b3(k L ), we define U \u2217 by U \u2217 \u2208 \u0393(k) and k \u2217 = k L . Therefore, Q(U \u2217) is the partial capacity Q max(k L ). Denoting the intersection between Q(\u03c1;k)= Q(U L ) and (\u03c1 \u2a7e \u03b3(0), k =0) by \u03c1 0 and the intersections between Q(\u03c1;k)= Q(U \u2217) and k =0 by \u03c1 1 and \u03c1 2, where \u03c1 1 \u2a7d \u03b3(0)\u2a7d \u03c1 2, we can obtain four types of solutions when \u03c1 R \u2208[0, \u03c1 1], (\u03c1 1, \u03c1 2), [\u03c1 2, \u03c1 0], or (\u03c1 0, \u03c1 j ], as shown in Fig. 4 . Type 4 When \u03c1 R \u2208[0, \u03c1 1]; i.e., Q(\u03c1 R ; 0)\u2a7d Q(U \u2217) and U R is UC, the wave solutions to the Riemann problem consist of three basic waves with two intermediate states, U \u2217 and U 1, where Q(U 1)= Q(U \u2217) and k 1 =0: the left wave (U L , U \u2217) is a rarefaction wave with a non-positive characteristic velocity, the center wave (U \u2217, U 1) is a standing wave, and the right wave (U 1, U R ) is a rarefaction wave with a positive characteristic velocity. As shown in Fig. 5 , the boundary flux q(x =0, t >0)= Q(U \u2217)= Q max(k L ). Type 5 When \u03c1 R \u2208(\u03c1 1, \u03c1 2); i.e., Q(\u03c1 R ; 0)> Q(U \u2217), the wave solutions to the Riemann problem consist of three basic waves with two intermediate states, U \u2217 and U 1, where Q(U 1)= Q(U \u2217) and k 1 =0: the left wave (U L , U \u2217) is a rarefaction wave with a non-positive characteristic velocity, the center wave (U \u2217, U 1) is a standing wave, and the right wave (U 1, U R ) is a shock wave with a positive speed. In this case, the boundary flux q(x =0, t >0)= Q(U \u2217)= Q max(k L ). Note that the kinematic wave solutions of Types 5 to 7 are similar to that in Fig. 3 and omitted. Type 6 When \u03c1 R \u2208[\u03c1 2, \u03c1 0]; i.e., Q(U L )\u2a7d Q(\u03c1 R ; 0)\u2a7d Q(U \u2217) and U R is OC, the wave solutions to the Riemann problem consist of two basic waves with the intermediate state U 1, where Q(U 1)= Q(U R ) and k 1 = k L : the left wave (U L , U 1) is a rarefaction wave with a negative characteristic velocity, and the right wave (U 1, U R ) is a standing wave. In this case, the boundary flux q(x =0, t >0)= Q(U R ). Type 7 When \u03c1 R \u2208(\u03c1 0, \u03c1 j ]; i.e., Q(\u03c1 R ; 0)< Q(U L ) and U R is OC, the wave solutions to the Riemann problem consist of two basic waves with the intermediate state U 1, where Q(U 1)= Q(U R ) and k 1 = k L : the left wave (U L , U 1) is a shock wave with a negative speed, and the right wave (U 1, U R ) is a standing wave. In this case, the boundary flux q(x =0, t >0)= Q(U R ). 4 The supply\u2013demand method with a new definition of traffic demand Based on the Riemann solutions in the previous section, we summarize solutions of the boundary flux q(x =0, t >0) in Table 1 . We introduce a new definition of partial traffic demand for commodity 1 in the upstream link as (18) D ( \u03c1 L ; k L ) = Q ( U L ) U L is UC Q max ( k L ) otherwise = min { \u03c1 L , \u03b3 ( k L ) } V ( min { \u03c1 L , \u03b3 ( k L ) } + k L ) , where \u03b3(k L ) is defined as the critical density for k L such that \u03c1V(\u03c1 + k L )\u2a7d \u03b3(k L ) V(\u03b3(k L )+ k L )= Q max(k L ) for any \u03c1 \u2208[0, \u03c1 j \u2212 k L ]. Thus \u03b3(0) and Q max(0) are the critical density and capacity of total traffic. Then the boundary flux q(x =0, t >0) in Table 1 can be computed by (19) q ( x = 0 , t > 0 ) = min { D ( \u03c1 L ; k L ) , S 1 ( \u03c1 R ; 0 ) } , where the supply of the downstream link, S 1, is the same as in Daganzo (1995) and Lebacque (1996); i.e., (20) S 1 ( \u03c1 R ; 0 ) = Q ( U R ) U R is OC Q max ( 0 ) otherwise = max { \u03c1 R , \u03b3 ( 0 ) } V ( max { \u03c1 R , \u03b3 ( 0 ) } ) , The validity of (19) can be verified for all types of solutions in Table 1. That is, it yields the same boundary flux as in analytical solutions to the Riemann problem of (8) with (9). For other commodities, the supply\u2013demand method (19) can be similarly derived. Moreover, it can be easily extended to the more complicated cases when the upstream and downstream branches have different fundamental diagrams and other road characteristics. In the literature, there are two diverge models based on the supply\u2013demand method. In Lebacque\u2019s diverge model (Lebacque, 1996), the boundary flux of commodity 1 is given by (21) q ( x = 0 , t > 0 ) = min { D 1 ( \u03c1 L ; k L ) , S 1 ( \u03c1 R ; 0 ) } , where the partial demand of commodity 1, D 1(\u03c1 L ; k L ), is defined as (22) D 1 ( \u03c1 L ; k L ) = \u03c1 L \u03c1 L + k L min { \u03c1 L + k L , \u03b3 ( 0 ) } V ( min { \u03c1 L + k L , \u03b3 ( 0 ) } ) . In Daganzo\u2019s diverge model (Daganzo, 1995), the boundary flux of commodity 1 is given by (23) q ( x = 0 , t > 0 ) = min D 1 ( \u03c1 L ; k L ) , S 1 ( \u03c1 R ; 0 ) , \u03c1 L k L S 2 ( k R ; 0 ) , where S 2(k R ; 0) can be defined similarly to (20). Both Lebacque\u2019s and Daganzo\u2019s diverge models use the same partial demand, which is proportional to the commodity proportion \u03c1 L /(\u03c1 L + k L ). But Daganzo\u2019s model considers supply constraints imposed by both downstream links, but Lebacque\u2019s only considers the supply constraint imposed by one downstream link. It can be shown that Daganzo\u2019s diverge model satisfies the FIFO principle, since the flux to downstream link 1 is proportional to the proportion of commodity 1 vehicles, and the total throughput of a diverging junction is maximized. In contrast, Lebacque\u2019s diverge model does not satisfy the FIFO principle. In Jin (2010), however, it was proved that the two models become equivalent when we shrink both the cell size \u0394x and the time step size \u0394t. That is, Lebacque\u2019s model violates the FIFO principle only in a short time interval and obeys it in the long run. The new diverge model, (19), is similar to (21) in the sense that it only considers the supply constraint imposed by downstream link 1. Thus we expect that the former also violates the FIFO principle during \u0394t. However, we also expect the new model converges when we decrease the cell size and the time-step size. That is, in the continuous counterpart of the new diverge model, traffic also follows the FIFO principle. These results could be proved with the same technique as in Jin (2010), but the proof is beyond the scope of this research. 5 Numerical simulations In this section, we will numerically study traffic dynamics in a small diverging network consisting of two downstream links and one upstream link: the lengths of three links are the same, L =1500m; the upstream link is labeled link 0, and the two downstream links labeled 1 and 2. They all have one lane. The simulation starts from t =0 and ends at t =1500s. Here we denote the densities of commodities 1 and 2 by \u03c1 and k, respectively. We use the triangular fundamental diagram for total traffic (Munjal et al., 1971; Haberman, 1977; Newell, 1993): V ( z ) = min v f , 1 \u03c4 1 z - 1 z j , Q ( z ; 0 ) = min v f z , 1 \u03c4 1 - z z j , where the total density z \u2208[0, z j ], and z j is the jam density per lane. Here we choose the following parameters: the free flow speed v f =30m/s, the jam density of a single lane z j =1/7veh/m/lane, and the time-gap \u03c4 =1.6s. Then the kinematic wave model of two-commodity traffic flow in the network can be written as \u2202 \u03c1 \u2202 t + \u2202 \u03c1 V ( \u03c1 + k ) \u2202 x = 0 , \u2202 k \u2202 t + \u2202 kV ( \u03c1 + k ) \u2202 y = 0 , where x \u2208[\u2212 L, L] is the coordinate of commodity 1 on links 0 and 1, and y \u2208[\u2212 L, L] the coordinate of commodity 2 on links 0 and 2. Here x and y overlap on the upstream link 0. Note that \u03c1(y)=0 for y \u2208(0, L], and k(x)=0 for x \u2208(0, L]. Since the critical density is \u03b3 ( 0 ) = 1 1 + \u03c4 v f z j z j , the total demand and supply functions are D ( \u03c1 ; 0 ) = Q ( min { \u03c1 , \u03b3 ( 0 ) } ; 0 ) , S ( \u03c1 ; 0 ) = Q ( max { \u03c1 , \u03b3 ( 0 ) } ; 0 ) . In addition, we have the following partial flow-density relation Q ( \u03c1 ; k ) = \u03c1 min v f , 1 \u03c4 1 \u03c1 + k - 1 z j , from which we have the partial critical density \u03b3 ( k ) = max \u03b3 ( 0 ) - k , z j k - k . Thus the partial demand in (18) is D ( \u03c1 ; k ) = Q ( min { \u03c1 , \u03b3 ( k ) } ; k ) . The quantities in k can be similarly defined. In the following simulations, we partition each link into M cells and the time interval into N steps, with N/M =1/30 always; e.g., if M =50 and N =1500, the cell length is \u0394x =30m, and the length of each time step \u0394t =1 s. Thus the CFL condition number v f \u0394 t \u0394 x = 1 . We denote traffic densities of commodities 1 and 2 at time step n by \u03c1 m n and k m n (m =1,\u2026,2M, n =0,\u2026, N), respectively. We introduce a dummy cell m =0 at the origin and a dummy cell m =2M +1 at each destination and denote traffic demands and supplies of commodity 1 by \u03b4 m n ( m = 0 , \u2026 , 2 M ) and \u03c3 m n ( m = 1 , \u2026 , 2 M + 1 ) and those of commodity 2 by d m n ( m = 0 , \u2026 , 2 M ) and s m n ( m = 1 , \u2026 , 2 M + 1 ) . In our simulations, demands in the origin cell and supplies in the destination cells are given as boundary conditions. For m =1,\u2026,2M, we calculate traffic demands and supplies of commodity 1 as follows: \u03b4 m n = \u03c1 m n \u03c1 m n + k m n D \u03c1 m n + k m n ; 0 , m = 1 , \u2026 , M - 1 , D \u03c1 m n ; k m n , m = M , D \u03c1 m n ; 0 , m = M + 1 , \u2026 , 2 M , \u03c3 m n = \u03c1 m - 1 n \u03c1 m - 1 n + k m - 1 n S \u03c1 m n + k m n ; 0 , m = 1 , \u2026 , M , S \u03c1 m n ; 0 , m = M + 1 , \u2026 , 2 M . Note that the partial supply in cell m is determined by the commodity proportion in the upstream cell m \u22121. Similarly, we calculate traffic demands and supplies of commodity 2 as follows: d m n = k m n \u03c1 m n + k m n D \u03c1 m n + k m n ; 0 , m = 1 , \u2026 , M - 1 , D k m n ; \u03c1 m n , m = M , D k m n ; 0 , m = M + 1 , \u2026 , 2 M , s m n = k m - 1 n \u03c1 m - 1 n + k m - 1 n S \u03c1 m n + k m n ; 0 , m = 1 , \u2026 , M , S k m n ; 0 , m = M + 1 , \u2026 , 2 M . We can see that only the formulas of partial demands, \u03b4 M n and d M n , in the cell M upstream to the diverge are different from those in Lebacque (1996), where they are calculated in the same way as \u03b4 m n and d m n (m < M), respectively. In addition, we denote the boundary flow-rates of commodities 1 and 2 from time step n to time step n +1 by \u03d5 m n and f m n ( m = 0 , \u2026 , 2 M , n = 0 , \u2026 , N - 1 ) , respectively. Here \u03d5 m n and \u03d5 m + 1 n are the upstream and downstream boundary fluxes of cell m for commodity 1, respectively; similarly, f m n and f m + 1 n are the upstream and downstream boundary fluxes of cell m for commodity 2, respectively. Then the boundary fluxes can be calculated from supply\u2013demand methods as follows: \u03d5 m n = min \u03b4 m n , \u03c3 m + 1 n , m = 0 , \u2026 , 2 M , f m n = min d m n , s m + 1 n , m = 0 , \u2026 , 2 M . Furthermore we apply the first-order Godunov method (Godunov, 1959) to obtain the following Cell Transmission Model, in which the traffic conditions are updated for each cell based on traffic conservation (m =1,\u2026,2M): (24a) \u03c1 m n + 1 = \u03c1 m n + \u0394 t \u0394 x \u03d5 m - 1 n - \u03d5 m n , (24b) k m n + 1 = k m n + \u0394 t \u0394 x f m - 1 n - f m n . 5.1 Simulation I: A general case In this simulation, we study a general case of diverging traffic. Initially, the upstream branch carries a constant congested flow with a traffic density 0.7z j =100veh/km and the proportion of vehicles traveling to downstream branch 1 is 80%; downstream link 1 is empty; traffic density on downstream link 2 is 0.7z j =100veh/km. In addition, we impose the Neumann boundary conditions on the boundary of this diverging network; i.e., the spatial derivatives of traffic densities at the boundary are set to be zero. With M =50 and N =1500, we obtain simulation results as shown in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6a illustrates the evolution of traffic on the upstream link 0: at time t =0\u03c4, traffic density is uniformly at z A =0.7z j ; after the beginning of the diverging process, traffic immediately upstream of the diverging point reaches a new state z B =0.2038z j , which keeps propagating on the upstream link; as a result, an expansion wave forms and travels upstream. Fig. 6b shows the evolution of traffic on downstream link 1: initially, this link is empty; after t =0, traffic immediately downstream of the diverging point reaches state \u03c1 C =0.0929z j ; along with the propagation of \u03c1 C on this link, another expansion wave forms and travels downstream; after around 200, the traffic density on this link is uniformly \u03c1 C . Fig. 6c presents the evolution of traffic on downstream link 2: initially, the traffic density is k A =0.7z j ; after vehicles start to diverge at t =0, traffic immediately downstream of the diverging point reaches k D =0.0232z j ; then a shock wave forms and travels downstream at a constant speed s =0.9101m/s. The expansion waves and the shock wave observed on the three branches can be shown on the z \u2212 q plane as in Fig. 6d, in which line AB represents the expansion wave on the upstream link 0, line OC represents the expansion wave on downstream link 1, and line DA represents the shock wave on downstream link 2, whose slope gives the shock wave speed. In this case, even though the downstream link 2 is initially congested, it does not block the upstream link since the proportion of vehicles traveling to this link is relatively small at 20%. As shown in Fig. 6, at the diverging point, asymptotically there are three traffic states, represented by B, C, and D in Fig. 6d. The flow rates at these states are q B =0.9121v f \u03b3(0), q C =0.7297v f \u03b3(0), and q D =0.1824v f \u03b3(0) respectively. Here v f \u03b3(0) is the capacity of a single lane. We can see that q B = q C + q D . Note that q B is the outflow of link 0, q C inflow to link 1, and q D inflow to link 2. Thus traffic is conserved at the diverge. Furthermore, q C /q B =80%, which is the proportion of commodity 1 vehicles on the upstream link traveling to link 1. Therefore, this is consistent with the FIFO principle that diverging flows are proportionally determined by the composition of traffic on the upstream link (Papageorgiou, 1990). This property of diverging flows guarantees that the composition of vehicles on the upstream link never changes as observed in our simulation. In contrast, if we use the diverge models by Daganzo or Lebacque, the asymptotic throughput at the diverging junction will be the same as the capacity, v f \u03b3(0). However, the throughput in the new diverge model equals q B =0.9121v f \u03b3(0), which represents about a 9% drop in the capacity. Therefore, the selfish diverging behaviors in the new model lead to reduced network capacities, and the maximum throughput rule is not observed. 5.2 Simulation II: An extreme case In this subsection, an extreme case is studied. Initially, like in the previous simulation, the upstream branch carries a constant flow with traffic density 0.7z j =100veh/km, the proportion of vehicles on the upstream link traveling to downstream branch 1 is 80%, and downstream link 1 is empty. However, traffic on downstream link 2 is jammed with a density z j =143 veh/km. Still, we impose the Neumann boundary conditions on the boundary of the diverging network and have the same discretization to the three links and the time duration: M =50 and N =1500. Simulation results are shown in Fig. 7 . In this simulation, traffic density on link 2 is uniformly z j as expected and not shown. Fig. 7a demonstrates traffic evolution on the upstream link 0: initially traffic density is z A =0.7z j ; after the beginning of the diverging process, traffic density immediately upstream of the diverging point reaches the jammed density z B = z j ; then jammed traffic propagates upstream as a back-traveling shock wave at a speed s =\u22124.3750m/s. Fig. 7b shows traffic dynamics on link 1. In this figure, we can observe small spikes of density, which travel downstream and shrink along time. After around t =400s, link 1 is almost empty again. Fig. 7d presents traffic states on the diverging network on the z \u2212 q plane. Here line AB represents the shock wave on the upstream link, and its slope gives the shock wave speed. From these figures, we can see that, if a downstream link is blocked, the upstream link will be blocked, and the other downstream link (s) will become empty, as expected. However, the spikes in Fig. 7b suggests that a small number of vehicles still get out of the upstream link at the very beginning. Although this phenomenon seems interesting, it is due to numerical errors caused by the finite number of cells, and are expected to disappear if we partition the links into fine enough cells. That is, as the Lebacque diverge model, this new model only violates the FIFO principle locally. 5.3 A convergence test In this subsection, we examine the convergence of the discrete diverge model, (24), under the same initial and boundary conditions as in Section 5.1. But we use six different sets of cell and time-step sizes: \u0394 x c = 60 2 c - 1 m, and \u0394 t c = 2 2 c - 1 s for c =1,\u2026,6. For each c, we denote the solutions of \u03c1(x, t) and k(x, t) at t =100 s by \u03c1 m c and k m c ( m = 1 , \u2026 , 50 \u00b7 2 c - 1 ) , respectively. We define two difference vectors between the solutions for c and c +1 by (m =1,\u2026,50\u00b72 c\u22121) \u03f5 m c = 1 2 \u03c1 2 m - 1 c + 1 + \u03c1 2 m c + 1 - \u03c1 m c , e m c = 1 2 k 2 m - 1 c + 1 + k 2 m c + 1 - k m c . Then we can calculate the aggregate error with respect to L 2-norm as E c = \u2211 m = 1 50 \u00b7 2 c - 1 \u03f5 m c 2 + e m c 2 100 \u00b7 2 c - 1 , from which we can compute the convergence rate of the discrete diverge model: (25) r c = log 2 E c E c + 1 . As shown in Table 2 , the convergence rates are always positive. If we denote r \u00af as the average rate of convergence, then r \u00af \u2248 0.25 . Thus, the computational errors in \u03c1(x, 100) and k(x, 100) are in the order of ( \u0394 x ) r \u00af (LeVeque, 2007), which converges to zero when we decrease the cell size. Therefore the discrete diverge model converges under given initial and boundary conditions. 6 Discussions In this paper, we introduced a new approach to modeling diverging traffic dynamics, in which traffic streams are segregated from each other through instantaneous decoupling during a short time interval. We presented analytical solutions to the instantaneous kinematic wave model and found that these solutions are consistent with the supply\u2013demand method if the traffic demand is modified accordingly. With numerical simulations, we asserted that this model satisfies three important properties: (1) the complete diverge model converges when we decrease the time-step size, (2) diverging flow to a downstream link is proportional to the fraction of vehicles traveling to this link, and (3) the upstream link is blocked after a downstream link is blocked. Thus the new diverge model is well-defined, and diverging traffic follows the First-In-First-Out rule in the new model. The instantaneous kinematic wave theory of diverging traffic is different from existing models since it provides more details on diverging traffic dynamics and sheds more light at the aggregate level how vehicles segregate themselves at a diverge. In addition, in the new model, each traffic stream attempts to maximize its own partial demand instantaneously. This corresponds to non-cooperative diverging behaviors of different traffic streams. As a result, it was found that the total boundary flux is not maximized. In contrast, existing diverge models are based on cooperative diverging behaviors and lead to optimal throughput. In the future, we will be interested in analyzing the magnitude of capacity reduction caused by such non-cooperative diverging behaviors. However, such an analysis has to be based on solutions to the complete diverge model and is beyond the scope of this study. We will also be interested in calibrating and validating this and other diverge models with observed data. The first task is to determine the location of an actual diverging point and how it is related to travelers\u2019 behaviors, the geometry of a diverge, and traffic conditions. Such a study is helpful for determining whether the FIFO principle is satisfied. Further, in order to determine whether traffic streams segregate in a cooperative manner or not, we need to find a diverging junction, where the downstream branches are free, and the upstream link has a sufficiently high demand, so that we can examine whether the total throughput is smaller than the capacity. However, many of available data sets are not applicable for such studies. For example, in the data sets for traffic on I-80 and I-101 by the NGSIM project (Federal Highway Administration, 2006), the segregation process was not captured, since exiting vehicles would switch to the shoulder lane way before they reach the off-ramp.

In this paper, we propose a kinematic wave theory for modeling dynamics of non-cooperative diverging traffic, in which traffic dynamics of vehicles to one direction are assumed to be independent of those to other directions instantaneously. During a short time interval, the kinematic wave model of diverging traffic is decoupled into a number of nonlinear resonant systems. From analytical solutions to the Riemann problem of a decoupled system, a new definition of partial traffic demand is introduced, so that diverging flows can be easily computed with the supply\u2013demand method. Then a Cell Transmission Model is proposed to solve the kinematic wave model of diverging traffic by taking into account of the interactions among different traffic streams. Simulation results demonstrate that vehicles follow the First-In-First-Out principle in the long run, and the model converges when we decrease the cell and time-step sizes. In addition, it is shown that traffic streams to different directions segregate in a selfish manner, and the total throughput of a diverging junction is not maximized as in existing diverge models.
