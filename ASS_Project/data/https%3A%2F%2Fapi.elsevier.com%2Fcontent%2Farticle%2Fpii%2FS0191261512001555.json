Abstract Using a stochastic cellular automaton model for urban traffic flow, we study and compare Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (MFDs) of arterial road networks governed by different types of adaptive traffic signal systems, under various boundary conditions. In particular, we simulate realistic signal systems that include signal linking and adaptive cycle times, and compare their performance against a highly adaptive system of self-organizing traffic signals which is designed to uniformly distribute the network density. We find that for networks with time-independent boundary conditions, well-defined stationary MFDs are observed, whose shape depends on the particular signal system used, and also on the level of heterogeneity in the system. We find that the spatial heterogeneity of both density and flow provide important indicators of network performance. We also study networks with time-dependent boundary conditions, containing morning and afternoon peaks. In this case, intricate hysteresis loops are observed in the MFDs which are strongly correlated with the density heterogeneity. Our results show that the MFD of the self-organizing traffic signals lies above the MFD for the realistic systems, suggesting that by adaptively homogenizing the network density, overall better performance and higher capacity can be achieved. Keywords Macroscopic fundamental diagram Traffic signal system Simulation 1 Introduction A central goal of traffic science is the formulation of appropriate macroscopic variables characterizing and relating demand and performance of road infrastructure. On the level of a single street (or freeway), the fundamental diagram (FD), introduced by Greenshields (1935), expresses flow as a function of density. Fundamental diagrams for a single link are generically unimodal, describing a free-flow regime at low densities and a congested regime at high densities. 1 Even in this simplest of cases, however, it is typically found experimentally that significant scatter is observed in flow-density relations of congested links; see Kerner (1998). 1 It is far from clear, however, to what extent such simple relations should extend to more complex systems such as urban road networks. Early studies in this direction date back at least to Godfrey (1969). The first convincing empirical evidence that congested urban networks can display simple relationships between network-aggregated demand and performance was presented in Geroliminis and Daganzo (2007, 2008). These works clearly indicate the existence of a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) in the city of Yokohama, relating network-aggregated production and accumulation. 2 The production and accumulation are surrogates for the flow and density, and are more readily measured in empirical trials. 2 Analytical theories attempting to explain the existence of MFDs have been developed by Daganzo and Geroliminis (2008) and Helbing (2009), and match the Yokohama data quite well. The discussion in Daganzo and Geroliminis (2008) analyzes the effects on MFDs of applying different signal timings, by treating traffic signals as exogenous capacity constraints. One of the main aims of the current work is to study and compare MFDs in networks governed by different types of adaptive traffic signal systems. Given the existence of MFDs, it is natural to ask under what conditions should they be observed? In previous work on MFDs, Daganzo and Geroliminis (2008) postulate sufficient regularity conditions under which MFDs should be expected to exist, including slow-varying and distributed demand, and homogeneous network infrastructure. Helbing (2009) argues that the details of MFD curves should be expected to depend not only on the aggregated density, but also on the spatial density distribution. Taking these observations further, Mazloumian et al. (2010) argue that the aggregated flow should in fact be a function of both the aggregated density and also its spatial variation. Geroliminis and Sun (2011b) demonstrate using empirical data that while strict homogeneity of traffic states is not necessary to observe a well-defined MFD, the spatial distribution of density is indeed a key quantity. In this work we study the spatial heterogeneity of both density and flow, and demonstrate how their behavior can be used as predictors of network performance. In particular, we discuss the relationship between the time evolution of spatial heterogeneity and hysteresis. Hysteresis has been observed and studied in freeway networks in Geroliminis and Sun (2011a). While hysteresis was not observed in Geroliminis and Daganzo (2008), a careful empirical study of MFDs in the city of Toulouse was undertaken by Buisson and Ladier (2009), in which hysteresis effects were clearly observed. A theoretical explanation of the clockwise hysteresis loops found in Buisson and Ladier (2009) was presented in Gayah and Daganzo (2011), by treating the network as a dynamical system and performing a stability analysis. This analysis, which assumed homogeneous loading of the network, suggested that clockwise hysteresis loops should be typical, while anticlockwise hysteresis loops should be rare. If the constraint of homogeneous loading is relaxed however, different behavior can arise. For example, for networks corresponding to commuter corridors, i.e. portions of an arterial network wedged between a strong source (e.g. a residential area) and a strong sink (e.g. the central business district), the input/output rates on the boundary may be significantly higher than in the bulk of the network. Other situations where such behavior might arise include arterial networks in the presence of perimeter control. We observe from our simulations that for such systems both clockwise and anticlockwise hysteresis loops can generically appear, and we show that these observations can be explained using a modified version of the model presented in Gayah and Daganzo (2011). Our simulations utilize a stochastic cellular automaton (CA) model, introduced by de Gier et al. (2011). This model is mesoscopic, in the sense that although individual vehicles are modeled, fine-grained details of individual driver behavior are deliberately treated in a course-grained, statistical, manner. While details of vehicular motion through intersections are deliberately ignored, realistic signal phasing at intersections is included in the model. In fact, the model was specifically designed to provide a simple and fast way to study arbitrary traffic signal systems, on arbitrary networks. Using this CA model we study the existence and shape of MFDs for three specific traffic signal systems, using both time-dependent and time-independent boundary conditions. In particular, we simulate variants of the SCATS 3 Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System 3 traffic signal system, which is currently employed by numerous road authorities worldwide, including in Sydney and Melbourne. In order to study the effect of increased adaptivity on MFDs, we then compare these results for SCATS with the highly-adaptive (idealized) self-organizing traffic lights (SOTL) system, originally introduced for Manhattan lattices by Gershenson (2005), and then generalized to arbitrary networks in de Gier et al. (2011). In particular, the version of SOTL that we study is specifically designed to minimize the spatial heterogeneity of the density within the network. Ji and Geroliminis (2012) have recently addressed the question of how to decompose road networks into subnetworks so that each subnetwork has a well-defined MFD, while Daganzo (2007) and Haddad and Geroliminis (2012) have studied how to optimize the control of flows between such subnetworks. SOTL can be viewed as a possible mechanism for adaptively homogenizing the density distributions within subnetworks. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the CA model introduced in de Gier et al. (2011), and define the network parameters we use for the simulations in this paper. Section 3 then defines the macroscopic quantities of interest in terms of observables of the CA model. In Section 4, we describe the three traffic signal systems that we study in our simulations, each of which has a different level of adaptivity. Then Sections 5 and 6 respectively describe the results of our simulations using time-independent and time-dependent boundary conditions. Section 6.3 discusses a modified version of the two-bin model in which the two bins are no longer assumed to be identical. Finally, Section 7 concludes with a discussion. 2 Cellular automata model We briefly outline the cellular automata model used in our simulations, which we refer to as the NetNaSch model. For a comprehensive description of the model see de Gier et al. (2011). Cellular automata (CA) are models which are discrete in time, space and state variables, whose dynamical rules are local. The NetNaSch model represents a road network by a directed graph, in which the nodes represent intersections and the links represent streets. With each link is associated an ordered list of lanes, and each lane is a simple one-dimensional stochastic CA obeying a (slight generalization of) the Nagel\u2013Schreckenberg (NaSch) dynamics; see Nagel and Schreckenberg (1992). In addition, vehicles may move between neighboring lanes via simple lane-changing rules. Thus, the dynamics along each given link is essentially a standard CA freeway model, albeit with input and output rates that are determined dynamically by the rest of the network. The NetNaSch model intentionally avoids modeling the detailed motion of vehicles as they move through intersections; the underlying assumption being that the actual time a vehicle physically spends in an intersection is unimportant compared to the time spent on the inbound link waiting to traverse the intersection. This course-grained approach allows the model to be easily applied to networks of arbitrary topology, using any choice of desired signal phasing. In order to mimic origin\u2013destination behavior, the NetNaSch model demands that each vehicle makes a random decision about which link it wants to turn into at the approaching intersection. More precisely, for each node n, we assign to each ordered pair (l, l\u2032), where l is an inlink and l\u2032 an outlink of n, the probability p T(l \u2192 l\u2032) that a vehicle on l wants to turn into l\u2032 when it reaches n. The turning decision is made when the vehicle first enters l, since its choice of which link to turn into at the approaching intersection should influence its dynamics as it travels along l. In particular, it influences the vehicle\u2019s choice of when to change lanes. In order to guarantee the robustness of the model, however, we do allow for drivers to adaptively change their turning decisions when faced with very high levels of congestion. This enables the model to avoid becoming frozen in pathological states of gridlock caused by drivers adhering strictly to their turning decisions. Specifically, suppose that a vehicle is queued at an intersection in a lane that is consistent with its current turning decision, but that the vehicle has waited through more than n G green signals without being able to clear the intersection, due to spillback on the link onto which it wishes to turn. In this instance, the NetNaSch model allows the vehicle to remake its random turning decision. We set n G =6 in the simulations in this work. The NetNaSch model can be used with a variety of boundary conditions. In this paper we use open boundary conditions, and so the density in the network is not controlled directly. Instead, at each time step, vehicles enter and exit the network stochastically, according to prescribed input/output rates. We call in- and output at the boundary of the network exogenous, while internal sources/sinks are called endogenous, for example representing parking garages. In general, both exogenous and endogenous input and output are allowed. A boundary link is a link which has one of its two endpoints within the network, and one external to the network. Boundary links are classified as either boundary inlinks, if their to-node belongs to the network, or boundary outlinks, if their from-node belongs to the network. A bulk link is a link whose endpoints are both contained in the chosen network. In the NetNaSch model, each lane \u03bb of each boundary inlink is assigned an input probability \u03b1 \u03bb : at each discrete time step a new vehicle is inserted into the first cell of lane \u03bb with probability \u03b1 \u03bb . Likewise, each lane \u03bb of each boundary outlink is assigned output probability \u03b2 \u03bb , which determines the probability that a vehicle wishing to exit the network from the last cell of lane \u03bb at a given time step actually be allowed to do so. The collections {\u03b1 \u03bb }, {\u03b2 \u03bb } therefore specify the exogenous input/output of the network, i.e. they describe the level of demand imposed on the network by its environment. Intuitively, one can view \u03b1 \u03bb as being the density of an external reservoir of vehicles being fed into boundary lane \u03bb. And likewise, one can view (1\u2212 \u03b2 \u03bb ) as being the density of an external sink being fed vehicles by boundary out-lane \u03bb. Indeed, for the 1-lane NaSch freeway model, where the reservoir and sink can be thought of as on- and off-ramps, these interpretations are quite realistic. As discussed in Section 3, the boundary links are not considered to be part of our network, in the sense that we do not include their densities and flows in our network aggregated values. Instead, the boundary links are simply viewed as buffers allowing a realistic way to couple the bulk network to its external environment. A practical issue that must be decided upon is how long to make the boundary links. There is no unique best answer to this question; a detailed discussion of the pros and cons of different possibilities is presented in de Gier et al. (2011). For the simulations discussed in the present work, we simply set the length of the boundary links equal to the length of the bulk links. One advantage of this approach is that spillback caused by over-saturation on boundary outlinks is modeled dynamically, in a realistic way. In addition to these exogenous inputs/outputs, each lane of each bulk link is assigned an input probability \u03b3 \u03bb , and an output probability \u03b4 \u03bb , which determine the rate of input and output from internal sources and sinks. Intuitively, one can view these internal sources and sinks as parking garages, for example. Then \u03b3 \u03bb is the probability that at a given time step, a vehicle will leave the parking garage and enter the network, while \u03b4 \u03bb is the probability that a vehicle passing such a parking garage will leave the network to enter the parking garage. For the simulations discussed in the present work, the internal sources and sinks were located near the middle of the lane, with the sink occurring before the source. For simplicity, we refer to the collection of all exogenous and endogenous inflow and outflow rates as the \u201cboundary conditions\u201d for the network, despite the fact that the endogenous rates are actually properties of the bulk. In principle then, the boundary conditions for a network are specified by the collections {\u03b1 \u03bb :\u03bb is a lane of an inlink}, {\u03b2 \u03bb :\u03bb is a lane of an outlink}, {\u03b3 \u03bb :\u03bb is a lane of a bulk link} and {\u03b4 \u03bb :\u03bb is a lane of a bulk link}. For a given network, one could conceive of varying all of these parameters independently, from 0 to 1, and studying the resulting distributions of flow and density. In order to meaningfully investigate MFDs however, we instead vary the \u03b1 \u03bb , \u03b2 \u03bb , \u03b3 \u03bb and \u03b4 \u03bb in a given systematic manner, corresponding to a reasonable demand scenario for an arterial network. We discuss several such scenarios in Section 2.4. We emphasize that the values of \u03b1 \u03bb , \u03b2 \u03bb , \u03b3 \u03bb and \u03b4 \u03bb can vary with time. We now summarize the details of the specific network and input parameters simulated in the present study. 2.1 Links and lanes According to the NaSch model, the speed v of each vehicle can take one of v max +1 allowed integer values v =0,1,2,\u2026, v max. Taking the length of a cell to be 7.5m, corresponding to the typical space occupied by each vehicle in a jam, and the duration of each time step to be 1s, suggests v max =3 is a reasonable choice for an urban network. I.e., each vehicle can move 0, 1, 2 or 3 cells per time step in such a CA model, depending on local traffic conditions. These are the values used in our simulations. In addition, the NaSch model (and consequently the NetNaSch model) includes, at each time step and for each vehicle, a random unit deceleration which is applied with probability p noise. By setting p noise so that it is 0.5 when the current vehicle speed is v max, and 0.2 otherwise we obtain an average free-flow speed of approximately 60km/h, which is typical of an arterial network. See the discussion in de Gier et al. (2011) for further details. The particular network we simulated in this study consists of a regular 8\u00d78 square grid. Each link in the network has two lanes plus an additional right-turning lane. 4 Vehicles drive on the left side of the road in Australia. 4 Fig. 1 shows a typical intersection in detail. With the exception of Section 5.1.5, the length of each bulk and boundary link was set to 750m, corresponding to 100 cells, and the length of each turning lane was set to 120m. This choice of link length corresponds to the distance between signalized intersections in an arterial network, and is typical of arterial road networks in predominantly suburban cities such as Melbourne. 2.2 Phases Each node was given the same four phases: a north/south phase, an east/west turning phase, an east/west phase and a north/south turning phase. See Fig. 2 . This fixed ordering of phases was applied to our simulations of SCATS. Note that the phase in Fig. 2a is not necessarily the first phase of the cycle; for SCATS with signal linking this is determined by the linking protocol as described in Section 4.1. 2.3 Turning probabilities In all our simulations, each link was assigned the same turning probability of p T for left and right turns, implying a probability 1\u22122 p T of continuing straight ahead. The probability p T was set to 0.1 for the majority of our simulations. For comparison, in Section 5.1.4 we discuss simulations using p T =0.15, 0.2. 2.4 Boundary conditions We consider a number of representative scenarios for the boundary conditions, which we summarize as follows. I. Time-independent. All input and output rates are constant in time. Two main variations were studied. (a) Isotropic. The same value of \u03b1 is applied to all inlinks, the same value of \u03b2 to all outlinks, and the same values of \u03b3 and \u03b4 to all bulk links. To obtain MFDs, the values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 were varied while the values of \u03b3 and \u03b4 were held constant. (b) Anisotropic. The value of \u03b1 on the west boundary is twice as large as on the other three boundaries, and likewise \u03b2 is only half as large on the east boundary. This sets up a west-to-east anisotropy in the demand imposed on the network. The endogenous sources and sinks were ignored in this case, i.e. (\u03b3, \u03b4)=(0,0). II. Time-dependent. In this case the boundary conditions are isotropic, but the values of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4 are time-dependent. The values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 were changed every 30min, and the network was simulated for 20h. For each of the three signal systems, the profiles of \u03b1 and \u03b2 were reverse-engineered to produce time series for the density profiles that resemble the empirical data for Yokohama presented in Geroliminis and Daganzo (2008). In each case, the peak densities were chosen so as to drive the MFD into the high-density regime during loading, and then allow it to relax back to the stationary low-density curve during recovery. Two extreme cases were studied. (a) Boundary Loading. Vehicles can enter and exit the network only via boundary links. I.e. \u03b3 and \u03b4 are strictly zero. (b) Uniform Loading. We allow vehicles to be loaded and unloaded uniformly throughout the network by setting \u03b3 = \u03b1 and \u03b4 = \u03b2. In the time-independent cases we compute MFDs by varying the exogenous demand, for a number of fixed choices of endogenous demand. This corresponds in some sense to viewing the endogenous demand as an inherent part of the network, comparable to the choice of signal system, etc., and studying how the network responds to different levels of external demand. Systems with low endogenous demand correspond to \u201ccommuter corridors\u201d; portions of the arterial network wedged between a strong source (e.g. a residential area) and a strong sink (e.g. the central business district). Higher values of (\u03b3, \u03b4) correspond to introducing shopping centers and parking garages, etc. into the bulk of the network. In the time-dependent case, in addition to the two extreme cases of boundary loading and uniform loading, we also studied a number of intermediate scenarios, in which the strength of the endogenous demand was non-zero but less than the exogenous demand. The resulting behavior of these systems was intermediate between the two extremes (a) and (b) and so for the purposes of illustration it suffices to focus on boundary and bulk loading. Finally, we note that Buisson and Ladier (2009) present a careful discussion of possible sources of network heterogeneity in empirical studies of MFDs, including the position of detectors, types of roads, and traffic signals. We deliberately study symmetric square-lattice networks for which all links are equivalent and all nodes are equivalent. 3 Observables We define the density, \u03c1 l (k), of link l at the kth time step of a simulation to be the fraction of all cells on l which are occupied at that instant. The flow, J \u03bb (k), of lane \u03bb during the kth time step is simply the indicator for the event that a vehicle crosses the boundary between a fixed pair of neighboring cells during the kth update. 5 In our simulations, the flow is measured 2v max cells from the upstream node of the link. 5 The flow J l (k) on link l at the kth time step is then simply the sum of the J \u03bb (k) over all lanes \u03bb in link l. We emphasize that since our model is stochastic, the observables \u03c1 l (k) and J l (k) are random variables. Since we are interested in the dynamics on the order of traffic cycles, rather than iterations of our model, we bin the instantaneous link flow and density into bins of size b, using b =5min in our simulations. In a slight abuse of notation, we define (1) \u03c1 l ( t ) \u2254 1 b \u2211 k = ( t - 1 ) b + 1 kb \u03c1 l ( k ) and J l ( t ) = 1 b \u2211 k = ( t - 1 ) b + 1 kb J l ( k ) , where the physical time t is measured in intervals of b =5min. Let us denote the set of all bulk links in the network by \u039b. We emphasize that the boundary links in the NetNaSch model are not considered to be part of the network, and serve only as an effective means of connecting the bulk to the external environment. From the link observables (1), we then define the following macroscopic network-aggregated observables: (2) \u03c1 ( t ) \u2254 1 | \u039b | \u2211 l \u2208 \u039b \u03c1 l ( t ) , h \u03c1 ( t ) \u2254 1 | \u039b | \u2211 l \u2208 \u039b [ \u03c1 l ( t ) - \u03c1 ( t ) ] 2 , J ( t ) \u2254 1 | \u039b | \u2211 l \u2208 \u039b J l ( t ) , h J ( t ) \u2254 1 | \u039b | \u2211 l \u2208 \u039b [ J l ( t ) - J ( t ) ] 2 . Again, we emphasize that these macroscopic observables are random variables in our model, although by aggregating the data over both time and space the fluctuations of these macroscopic observables will be significantly suppressed relative to the original instantaneous link observables. The quantities J(t) and \u03c1(t) are the network-aggregated flow and density. We refer to the quantities h \u03c1 (t) and h J (t) as the heterogeneity (spatial variability) of the density and flow respectively, since they give a measure of the extent to which the spatial distribution of the link-level observables differ from the corresponding network-aggregated values. Note that the heterogeneities achieve their lower bound of 0 only when the corresponding link observables are all equal. A fundamental question to be studied via our simulations is the extent to which \u03c1(t) and/or h \u03c1 (t) determine the value of J(t). The statement that an invariant MFD exists implies that J(t) should be a function of \u03c1(t) alone. However, recent work by Mazloumian et al. (2010) and Geroliminis and Sun (2011b) suggest that h \u03c1 (t) is also an important indicator of network performance. Our simulations confirm this. In fact, we find that both h \u03c1 (t) and h J (t) provide valuable indicators of network performance. 3.1 Statistics For each distinct choice of traffic signal system and boundary conditions, we performed n independent simulations (with n ranging between 10 and 30), in order to estimate the expected values of the network-aggregated quantities defined in (2). For a given observable X(t), if we denote its realization in the ith run by X (i)(t) then we compute (3) X ( t ) \u00af = 1 n \u2211 i = 1 n X ( i ) ( t ) , (4) err ( X ( t ) \u00af ) = 1 n ( n - 1 ) \u2211 i = 1 n [ X ( i ) ( t ) - X ( t ) \u00af ] 2 , where X ( t ) \u00af is the natural estimator for the expected value of X(t) and err ( X ( t ) \u00af ) is its standard error. 3.2 Physical units The density, \u03c1 l , gives the fractional occupation of the link l, relative to the maximum physically possible density, \u03f1 max. Consequently, \u03c1 l is a dimensionless quantity lying in the interval [0,1]. Taking the length of a cell in the NetNaSch model to be 7.5m, as discussed in Section 2.1, gives a maximum density of \u03f1 max =400/3\u2248133veh/km. To obtain densities in physical units of veh/km, therefore, the dimensionless densities \u03c1 l can be multiplied by \u03f1 max =133. The network aggregated density, \u03c1, and its heterogeneity, h \u03c1 , have the same dimensions as \u03c1 l and the same conversions apply. Taking the duration of each time step in the NetNaSch model to be 1s, as discussed in Section 2.1, implies that the flow J l on link l is measured in units of veh/s. We emphasize that the link flows we measure are not normalized by the number of lanes, which in all cases is 2. The network aggregated flow, J, and its heterogeneity, h J , have the same dimensions as J l . 4 Traffic signal systems We simulate and study the existence of MFDs in networks using three distinct traffic signal systems: SCATS-L: A model of SCATS with linking and adaptive cycle lengths. SCATS-F: A \u201cfree\u201d version of SCATS-L, with no signal linking. SOTL: Self-organizing traffic lights. The SCATS traffic signal system, which controls the traffic signals in numerous cities around the world, uses knowledge of the recent state of traffic to choose appropriate values of three key signal parameters: cycle length, split time, and linking offset. At each intersection it can adaptively adjust both the total cycle length, and the fraction (split) of the cycle given to each particular phase. In addition, it can coordinate (link) the traffic signals of several consecutive nodes along a predetermined route by introducing fixed offsets between the starting times of specific phases, thereby creating a green wave. Both the SCATS-L and SCATS-F models are special cases of our general SCATS model, which we outline in Section 4.1. As a benchmark with which to compare the SCATS-like traffic signal systems, we also considered the highly-adaptive self-organizing traffic lights (SOTL) system (see de Gier et al. (2011)). The SOTL system is based on the simple principle that each node (intersection) should choose its current phase to be the phase which currently has the highest demand. Unlike SCATS, no direct coordination is enforced between the signals at neighboring nodes, however such coordination is often seen to arise via self-organization, since neighboring nodes do indirectly communicate with each other via the levels of traffic that they accept and release. The particular version of SOTL that we study here uses density as the demand metric, and it therefore strives to adaptively minimize the network\u2019s density heterogeneity. The details of the SOTL system are summarized in Section 4.2. 4.1 SCATS The SCATS control system adaptively controls three key signal parameters: linking offset, cycle length and split time. We discuss below how our model of SCATS chooses each of these parameters. 4.1.1 Linking A subsystem in a SCATS network is a group of nodes which all share a common cycle length. If a node does not belong to any subsystem, we call it a non-subsystem node. Within each subsystem, we appoint a unique master node m and a number of slave nodes s. Fig. 3 illustrates an 8 by 8 network with eight subsystems, each consisting of one master node and six slave nodes. To implement linking, each node is assigned a special phase P \u2217 , which is its linked phase. If the linked phase P m \u2217 of the master node m starts at time t then P s \u2217 of the slave node starts at time t + T s , where T s is the offset. Ideally, the linking offset should be chosen based on the distance L between m and s, and the instantaneous local space-mean speed. In practice, actual implementations of SCATS tend to operate with fixed offsets during a given period of the day (for example morning peak hour). In our simulations we therefore use a fixed linking speed v \u00af = 54 km / h , which is just slightly less than the average free-flow speed of about 60km/h, see Section 2.1. 4.1.2 Cycle length and split plan SCATS chooses the unique cycle length within a subsystem based on the local traffic conditions in the neighborhood of the master node, as quantified by the Degree of Saturation (DoS). Every time a master node is about to restart its cycle, the cycle length is adjusted adaptively based on recent measured values of the DoS. In our model of SCATS, the cycle length is selected based on the volume ratio. For an inlink l and phase P the volume ratio is defined to be (5) R ( l , P ) = 1 N ( l , P ) V ( l , P ) S ( P ) , where V ( l , P ) is the measured traffic volume out of inlink l during phase P , and S ( P ) is P \u2019s current split time. The quantity N ( l , P ) denotes a fixed benchmark volume for the link and phase, measured in vehicles per second. 6 In our simulations N ( l , P ) was set to 1veh/s for all phases. 6 If the volume ratio was large during the previous cycle, then the cycle length is increased by a fixed amount. Conversely, if green time was wasted during the previous cycle, the cycle length is decreased. The key underlying strategy is to attempt to keep the volume ratio within the range [0.85,0.95]. Once the cycle length is determined, the split of a phase is taken to be proportional to its traffic volume during the previous cycle. The specific details of cycle length and split time selection are discussed more fully in Appendix A.1. 4.1.3 Versions of SCATS Based on the model of SCATS outlined above, we considered two variants: SCATS-L and SCATS-F. The first variant, SCATS-L, operates on the linked network shown in Fig. 3. By contrast, SCATS-F operates on the network where no subsystems or linking are imposed, so that each node chooses its own cycle length and split time plan according to its local traffic state, independently of its neighbors. 4.2 SOTL The third signal system we study is the self-organizing traffic lights (SOTL) system described in de Gier et al. (2011). While SCATS-L and SCATS-F are adaptive in their cycle length and split time selections, they both maintain a fixed cyclic ordering of each node\u2019s phases. By contrast, the SOTL system is acyclic, and is designed so that at each phase change, the phase which currently has highest demand is selected. This procedure is applied independently to each node. Suppose we agree on a suitable demand function d ( P ) which quantifies the demand of each phase P of each given node. Phases with large values of d ( P ) should be candidates for being the next choice of the active phase. However, one should also keep track of the time \u03c4 ( P ) that each phase has been idle, since we do not want a given phase to remain idle for too long, unless it has strictly zero demand. The key idea behind SOTL is to compute a threshold function, \u03ba ( P ) , for each phase P , which depends on both the phase\u2019s idle time and demand function, and when \u03ba ( P ) reaches a predetermined threshold value, \u03ba ( P ) > \u03b8 , we consider making P the active phase. For a detailed general discussion of the SOTL methodology, see de Gier et al. (2011). In the simulations performed in the current work, the demand d ( P ) of phase P was simply chosen to be the total number of vehicles over all its inlinks, and the threshold function was (6) \u03ba ( P ) = d ( P ) \u03c4 ( P ) \u2211 P \u2032 d ( P \u2032 ) , This particular choice for the demand function implies that SOTL attempts, at each instant of time, to adaptively minimize the network\u2019s density heterogeneity. We used a threshold value of \u03b8 =5. A precise algorithmic description of SOTL is given in Algorithm 2 in Appendix A.2. 5 Simulations: time-independent boundary conditions We simulated the network described in Section 2, using the three different traffic signal systems described in Section 4, and measured the macroscopic observables defined in (2). In this section, we present the results for the time-independent boundary conditions defined in Section 2.4. We simulated each system for 10h, which ensured that stationarity was always reached. 5.1 Isotropic boundary conditions In this section, we present our results for simulations using the isotropic Boundary Condition (a). In this case, we have two free parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2, where \u03b1 is the input probability on each boundary inlink, and \u03b2 the output probability on each boundary outlink. Fixed values for the bulk input and output probabilities \u03b3 and \u03b4 were applied to all bulk links. Three different choices for the fixed values of (\u03b3, \u03b4) were simulated: (\u03b3, \u03b4)=(0,0), (0.05,0.1), (0.1,0.2). We note that in the isotropic case, the SCATS-L system is somewhat artificial, since there is no motivation for imposing linking if the demand is isotropic; we include SCATS-L here to enable comparisons with the results for the anisotropic network discussed in Section 5.2. 5.1.1 Zero \u03b3 and \u03b4 Fixing \u03b3 = \u03b4 =0, we simulated the network using a number of different values of \u03b1 and \u03b2, in order to obtain a range of values of the aggregated network density, ranging from very low to very high. We observed that, in all cases, the flow and density reach approximately stationary values by hours 5 or 6. For a given choice of traffic signals, the longest relaxation times were observed for flows close to capacity. For SOTL, stationarity was always achieved much faster than for SCATS (at comparable densities), typically by hours 3 or 4, which implies that the relaxation time of the network using SOTL is much smaller than when using SCATS. In Figs. 4 a\u2013c we plot J \u00af against \u03c1 \u00af for SCATS-F, SCATS-L, and SOTL respectively, at hours 1,2,\u2026,6 of the simulations. For each signal system, the low-density branch of the curves are essentially time-independent, as is the highly-oversaturated region of the congested branch. For intermediate values of density, approximately in the range [0.3,0.8], we see a time dependence in the early hours of the simulation, however we also clearly see that the J \u00af vs \u03c1 \u00af curves are converging to a well-defined stationary MFD as time increases. After approximately 6h of simulation, the J \u00af vs \u03c1 \u00af curves at all later times are essentially indistinguishable. We note that Mazloumian et al. (2010) observed similar time-dependent behavior during 3-hour simulations of their model, and they concluded that such time-dependence would likely persist at all later times. Fig. 4 would suggest however that such time-dependence is in fact transient, and, for all practical purposes, ceases to be observable after some finite time. It is conceivable that the behavior observed in Mazloumian et al. (2010) is an consequence of their use of periodic boundary conditions. From Fig. 4a and b, we can see that for both SCATS-F and SCATS-L, the instantaneous MFD curves appear to decrease monotonically with time towards their stationary limits. From Fig. 4c however, we notice that for SOTL the MFD at hour 1 lies below the limiting stationary curve. We shall return to a discussion of this transient behavior in Section 5.1.2. Fig. 4d shows a comparison of the stationary MFDs for the three traffic signal systems, SCATS-F, SCATS-L, and SOTL. In the low density regime, the performance of each system is quite similar. However, SOTL clearly allows the network to reach a higher capacity: SOTL achieves a maximum flow of approximately 0.43 at a density around 0.34, while SCATS-F and SCATS-L obtain maxima of approximately 0.39 at densities around 0.19. This represents a 10% increase in network capacity by using SOTL, compared with SCATS. We note that SCATS-F performs better than SCATS-L in the high density regime. This is in fact to be expected, since for an isotropic network, linking should at best be merely unhelpful, and at worst it will be counterproductive because it will reduce the system\u2019s adaptivity. We return to the comparison between SCATS-F and SCATS-L in Section 5.2. 5.1.2 Heterogeneity In order to gain insight into the underlying cause of the transient behavior displayed by the MFDs, we consider how the corresponding heterogeneity curves evolve with time. We begin by considering the density heterogeneity. In Fig. 5 a we plot h \u00af \u03c1 for SCATS-L at hours 1,2,\u2026,6. Geroliminis and Sun (2011b) find empirically that for a given network density, the flow should be lower when the density heterogeneity is higher. Comparison of Fig. 4b with Fig. 5a confirms this; if one observes the time evolutions of the MFD curve and h \u00af \u03c1 vs \u03c1 \u00af curve in the neighborhood of a given value of \u03c1 \u00af , there is a clear anticorrelation between the flow and the density heterogeneity. At moderate values of the density, h \u00af \u03c1 starts at low values early in the simulation, and then increases to a stationary curve at around hour 5 or 6. Conversely, the flow starts at relatively high values and decreases to its stationary value, again reaching stationarity at around hour 5 or 6. Similar behavior is observed for SCATS-F. If one considers the analogous plots for SOTL, Figs. 4c and 5c, at hours 3,\u2026,6, precisely the same behavior can be observed, although it is less pronounced. The most obvious feature in Figs. 4c and 5c, however, is the behavior of the instantaneous curves at hour 1 (and to a lesser extent, hour 2): for moderate values of density, the flow is below its stationary limit, while h \u00af \u03c1 is above its stationary limit. This again demonstrates the anticorrelation between the network flow and the density heterogeneity. In fact, the same type of behavior displayed by SOTL at hour 1 is also present in SCATS-L and SCATS-F, however it largely occurs before hour 1 in these cases. This type of behavior is presumably related to the fact that the simulations are started from a completely empty network, with vehicles only entering via the boundary. The general conclusion to be drawn from these observations is that while the transient behavior of the flow at a given density might be subtle (e.g. non-monotonic in time), at all times there is a strong anticorrelation between flow and density heterogeneity. We shall see in Section 6 that this relationship between the transient behavior of J and h \u03c1 plays an important role in understanding hysteresis in networks with time-dependent boundary conditions. As a practical observation, we note that h \u00af \u03c1 is considerably smaller when the network is governed by SOTL than when governed by SCATS-L, which is unsurprising given that SOTL is specifically designed to adaptively reduce the density heterogeneity. Given the previous observation that the SOTL MFD lies strictly above the SCATS-L MFD, this suggests that a methodology of adaptive density homogenization can provide a highly effective means of network control. The relationship between the transient behaviors of the flow and the flow heterogeneity is more complicated, however. We shall present a careful time series analysis of the cross correlations between h J and J elsewhere. However, the stationary behavior of the h \u00af J vs \u03c1 \u00af curves appear to contain a considerable amount of information. In particular, for all three signal systems studied, there appears to be a point of inflection in the stationary h \u00af J vs \u03c1 \u00af curve either at, or slightly before, the density \u03c1 c at which the network reaches capacity. Fig. 5b and d shows h \u00af J vs \u03c1 \u00af for SCATS-L and SOTL, respectively. For the case of SOTL there is in fact a long plateau, implying that for the majority of the free-flow regime the flow heterogeneity is independent of the network density in this case. 5.1.3 Effects of internal sources/sinks We now consider the effect of introducing non-zero values of the internal input and output probabilities, \u03b3 and \u03b4, which model endogenous sources/sinks such as parking garages. Fig. 6 a and b shows the MFDs for SCATS-L and SOTL produced by varying \u03b1 and \u03b2 for two distinct, non-zero, fixed values of (\u03b3,\u03b4), and compares them with the (\u03b3, \u03b4)=(0,0) case already discussed. The results for SCATS-F are intermediate between those of SCATS-L and SOTL. The first observation is simply that different values of (\u03b3, \u03b4) clearly produce different MFD curves as \u03b1 and \u03b2 are varied. This is to be expected, since the stronger the internal sources and sinks, the more homogeneous is the network; for sufficiently strong internal sources and sinks the effects of the boundary become essentially irrelevant. The second observation is that for both SCATS-L and SOTL, the MFDs are translated to the right (higher densities) as \u03b3 and \u03b4 increase. This is intuitively reasonable; for (\u03b3, \u03b4) strictly zero the links deep in the bulk of the network would be expected to have lower density than those near the boundary, implying that the aggregated network density should be lower. This scenario explains why the translation of the MFD is more pronounced for SCATS-L than for SOTL, since we have already seen in Fig. 5 that the heterogeneity of SCATS-L is much higher than that for SOTL. A final observation is that for SOTL the capacity is also marginally higher with non-zero \u03b3, \u03b4 than with zero \u03b3, \u03b4. For SCATS-L, there is considerably more statistical noise in the high density branch when simulating with non-zero \u03b3, \u03b4, and it is not clear to what extent the capacities change, if at all. Apart from these translations and rescalings, Fig. 6a and b shows that no qualitative change in the shapes of the stationary MFDs is introduced by applying non-zero internal sources/sinks. By contrast, we will see in Section 6 that when using time-dependent boundary conditions, the introduction of sufficiently strong internal sources and sinks can qualitatively affect the behavior of the network. 5.1.4 Turning probabilities We now briefly turn our attention to the impact on MFDs of varying the turning probabilities, again using isotropic boundary conditions (Boundary Condition (a)). Fig. 7 a\u2013c compares the MFDs produced for networks with turning probabilities p T =0.1, 0.15, 0.2, for SCATS-F, SCATS-L, and SOTL, respectively. While the low density branches are invariant with p T, it is clear that the high density branches become more rapidly decaying as p T increases. For both p T =0.15 and p T =0.2, there is a critical density \u03c1 j such that the flow remains constant for all \u03c1 \u00af > \u03c1 j . This value of \u03c1 j decreases as p T increases. Although it is not observable for p T =0.1, it is presumably present in principle but at a density higher than any we simulated. We note that even for \u03c1 \u00af > \u03c1 j , the flow is non-zero, so the network is not locked into a rigid gridlock. The value of this plateaued high-density flow can be seen to decrease as p T increases. On a practical level, we note that for p T =0.15 and p T =0.2 the capacities for SCATS-L and SCATS-F are again very close, and again both are lower than the corresponding capacity observed for SOTL. Fig. 7d shows the instantaneous MFDs at hours 1,2,\u2026,6 for a network governed by SCATS-F, with p T =0.2. The transient behavior is qualitatively the same as that shown in Fig. 4a for p T =0.1. The low density branch is stationary already by hour 1, while the high density branch decreases to its stationary limit, which is reached by hour 4 or 5. The extent to which the curves at hours 1 and 2 differ from their stationary limits is clearly much larger for p T =0.2 than observed for p T =0.1 however. Similar behavior was observed for SCATS-L and SOTL. 5.1.5 Link lengths As discussed in Section 2.1, in general, the networks we simulate have bulk links of length 750m, with right-turning lanes of length 120m. In this section we study the effect of varying the length of both the main lanes and the turning lanes. We begin by considering the effect of doubling the length of the turning lanes. In Fig. 8 a we compare the MFDs produced by a system governed by SOTL with turning probabilities p T =0.15, 0.20, with turning lanes of length 120m (denoted short TL) and 240m (denoted long TL). All other parameters are set as in Section 5.1.4. The data for the short TL system is in fact identical to that plotted in Fig. 7c; we repeat it here for ease of comparison with the long TL case. For both p T =0.15 and p T =0.2, we see that the systems with short and long turning lanes have identical behavior at very-low and very-high densities. This is to be expected; at very low densities both turning lanes will be relatively unoccupied, whereas at very high densities both turning lanes will suffer from spillback. At moderately high densities however, the MFD of the long TL system lies strictly above that of the short TL system. We conclude that for sufficiently large turning probabilities, increasing the length of turning lanes can produce a non-trivial increase in the network\u2019s MFD at moderately high densities. An analogous comparison of the long and short TL systems was also made with p T =0.1, however there was no observable difference in this case. This is intuitively reasonable; for fixed lane lengths, there should be a value of the turning probabilities below which the effect of congestion on the turning lanes is negligible compared to congestion on the main lanes. In such a case, increasing the length of the turning lane further does not modify the network\u2019s MFD. Our results show that this is already the case for p T =0.1 in the short TL network. We next considered the effect of decreasing the length of the bulk links, to a length relevant to urban downtown networks. In Fig. 8b we show the results of repeating the simulations presented in Fig. 4 using 210m bulk links. To facilitate comparison with Fig. 4d, we left the lengths of the turning lanes fixed. A comparison of Figs. 8b and 4d show a number of differences. Firstly, for each signal system, we observe that the value of the maximum flow is lower for the network with shorter links. For example, the maximum flow for SOTL drops from around 0.43 for the network with long bulk links to around 0.39. Such behavior is in agreement with theoretical predictions based on variational theory presented in Daganzo and Geroliminis (2008). In addition, for all three signal systems, the slope of the low-density branch of the MFD is larger in the system with long links. Conversely, the slope on the high-density branch is larger for the system with short links. For the system with short links, a steep drop in the MFD is clearly observed at density \u03c1 \u00af \u2248 0.5 . Beyond that density, the network becomes highly congested and the flow plateaus at a very small value, less than 0.05. Comparing the different signal systems, we see that again SOTL outperforms the SCATS systems. Furthermore, the relative improvement of SOTL over SCATS in the low-density branch of the MFD is significantly more pronounced for the system with short links. Finally, we note that in reality, networks with short links would likely also have shorter turning lanes. We therefore also repeated the simulations presented in Fig. 8b using turning lanes of length 45m. The relationship between the resulting MFDs and Fig. 8b are found to be similar to the scenario illustrated in Fig. 8a. In this case however, we observe that the MFD of the system with the shorter turning lanes lies strictly below that of the system with longer turning lanes, even at p T =0.1. This illustrates the converse of our observation above: for a given value of p T, the high-density branch of the MFD can be decreased by shortening the length of the turning lanes sufficiently. 5.2 Anisotropic boundary conditions In this section we present our results for simulations using Boundary Condition (b). In this case, we again have two free parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2, where \u03b1 is the input probability on each inlink on the west boundary, and \u03b2 the output probability on each outlink on the east boundary. All other boundary inlinks have input probability \u03b1/2 and all other boundary outlinks have output probability 2\u03b2. No internal sources or sinks are present (\u03b3 = \u03b4 =0) and the turning probability is p T =0.1. These boundary conditions imply that the demand in the west-to-east direction is twice that of other directions. In the presence of such anisotropy, applying linking with SCATS-L is a very natural thing to do, and our simulations of SCATS-L are linked in the west-to-east direction. In Fig. 9 a we plot a comparison of the stationary MFDs of the networks using SCATS-F, SCATS-L, and SOTL, corresponding to hour 6 of our simulations, by which time each system had reached approximate stationarity. The transient behavior prior to stationarity is qualitatively the same as described for the case of isotropic boundary conditions discussed in Section 5.1. The first observation is simply that for each signal system, well-defined stationary MFDs do exist in the presence of anisotropic boundary conditions. However, the shapes of the stationary curves are clearly quite different to those produced by isotropic boundary conditions as shown in Fig. 4. While in the isotropic case the MFDs are smooth curves which qualitatively resemble a typical single-link FD, the MFDs shown in Fig. 9a have a more intricate structure. In particular, for all three signal systems, the stationary MFD displays two steep drops in flow. The first of these occurs for \u03c1 \u00af \u2248 0.4 , and is most pronounced for SCATS. For SOTL, the location of this first drop is close to the density \u03c1 c which produces maximum flow, while for SCATS it occurs well beyond \u03c1 c. As observed in the isotropic case for p T =0.2, for densities above a critical value, \u03c1 j, an oversaturated regime with constant flow is obtained. Again, even for \u03c1 \u00af > \u03c1 j the flow remains non-zero, although it is very low. For all three signal systems, a second steep drop can be observed for \u03c1 \u00af \u2248 \u03c1 j . This drop is very sharp, even for SOTL. Some insight into this behavior can be obtained by comparing with the corresponding density heterogeneities in Fig. 9b. For all three signal systems, the location of the drop in the MFD near \u03c1 j coincides exactly with a cusp in the density heterogeneity. In addition, for SCATS-L and SCATS-F, the sharp drop in the MFD near \u03c1 \u00af \u2248 0.4 coincides exactly with a sharp rise in the density heterogeneity. In summary, we see that anisotropies in demand significantly affect the shape, but not the existence of the MFD curves. We now turn to a comparison of the different signal systems. We begin by comparing SCATS-L and SCATS-F. For networks with strongly anisotropic demand, one would intuitively expect signal linking to play a beneficial role. Indeed, if one focuses only on travel times along the peak (linked) direction, the SCATS-L system performs considerably better than SCATS-F in the low density regime. However, we see from Fig. 9a that the MFDs produced by SCATS-L and SCATS-F are very similar. Although SCATS-L provides improved performance for the links in the peak direction, this beneficial treatment of the linked subsystem occurs at the expense of the non-linked routes, and no clear net benefit is observable when using the network MFD as the performance metric. Finally, let us compare the performance of SOTL with that of the SCATS systems. At densities lower than 0.2 and higher than 0.4 all three systems perform similarly, although we note that at low densities SOTL has both higher network flows and lower travel times in the linked direction than either SCATS-L or SCATS-F. For moderate densities, however, we observe that SOTL has significantly higher network flow, and lower density heterogeneity, than either SCATS system. This suggests that a methodology of adaptive density homogenization can provide a more effective means of network control than signal linking, even in networks with inherently anisotropic demand. 6 Simulations: time-dependent boundary conditions 6.1 Simulations In the previous section, we applied time-independent boundary conditions, and observed that the system took up to 6h to reach stationarity. In real-world scenarios, however, traffic demand typically varies with time, and in practice a network may never actually reach stationarity. Understanding transient behavior of the network dynamics is therefore of significant practical importance. In this section we present our results for simulations using Boundary Condition II. of Section 2.4. We select appropriate values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 so that we can simulate the network traffic variation during a typical weekday. Specifically, we consider a 20h period, and enforce two peaks in the demand; one corresponding to the morning, the other to the afternoon. At each instant, the same value of \u03b1 (resp. \u03b2) is applied to each boundary inlink (resp. outlink), so the boundary conditions are isotropic. We consider two scenarios for the internal sources and sinks: \u03b3 = \u03b4 =0, in which case the demand is entirely driven by the boundary; and \u03b3 = \u03b1,\u03b4 = \u03b2, in which case the bulk input (output) occurs at the same rate as the boundary input (output). We refer to these two cases as boundary loading and uniform loading, respectively. Unlike the time-independent case discussed in the previous section, in the time-dependent case we find that varying the relative strength of the internal sources/sinks compared with the boundary demand can produce rather different qualitative behavior. For each of the three signal systems, and for both boundary and uniform loading, the peak densities were chosen so as to drive the MFD into the high-density regime during loading, and then allow it to relax back to the stationary low-density curve during recovery. The time series of the resulting network density and flow for SCATS-L are shown in Fig. 10 ; the corresponding profiles for SCATS-F and SOTL were very similar, although SOTL produced higher and sharper peaks in the density. Fig. 11 a, c, and e show the relationship between the density and flow for each of the three signal control systems studied, in the case of uniform loading, while Fig. 12 a, c, and e, show the analogous plots in the case of boundary loading. Each plot is in fact a parametric plot in the density-flow plane, parameterized by time. In each case, the density-flow curve obtained during the first 4h of the simulation coincides exactly with the corresponding stationary MFD. During this period, the network is initially empty, and as the density increases the flow increases until maximum flow is obtained. Throughout this period, the network remains uncongested, and no transient effects are observed. However, as the morning peak in demand is approached, which occurs at around hour 6 of the simulations, we see that the density-flow curves develop non-trivial time dependences, and hysteresis effects emerge. 6.2 Hysteresis Let us analyze the observed hysteresis patterns in more detail. We begin with the case of uniform loading. Fig. 11e shows the time evolution of the MFD for SOTL. The system reaches capacity at approximately hour 4, after which time flow decreases as density is further increased. This continues until around hour 6, when the first peak in demand is reached. After this point, density drops and flow begins to increase again until it again reaches capacity, at around hour 8. However the curve followed during this \u201crecovery\u201d process (hours 6\u20138) lies below the curve followed in the original \u201cloading\u201d process (hours 4\u20136). The MFD curve from hour 4 to hour 8 therefore defines a clockwise hysteresis loop. Similar behavior occurs at later times also. Indeed, we observe a further two clockwise hysteresis loops: from capacity, to low density, back to capacity (hours 8\u201312); from capacity, to high density, back to capacity (hours 12\u201316). Finally, the system recovers from capacity to the very low density regime (hours 16\u201320); this final recovery curve is initially below the initial loading curve (hours 0\u20134), but coincides with it at sufficiently low densities. Qualitatively similar behavior is also observed for SCATS-L and SCATS-F, although the size of the loops tend to be somewhat larger. Clockwise hysteresis loops were recently observed in an empirical study of MFDs in Toulouse, presented in Buisson and Ladier (2009), where it was argued that hysteresis is caused by spatial heterogeneity in network density. In Fig. 11b, d and f we show plots of the density heterogeneity, under uniform loading, for each of the three signal systems studied. In each case, the heterogeneity displays hysteretic behavior very similar to that observed in the corresponding MFD, but with opposite orientation; the MFDs in Fig. 11 all display clockwise hysteresis loops, while their corresponding heterogeneity plots display anticlockwise loops. This behavior is to be expected when loading is uniform; the level of density heterogeneity produced when a network is loading is governed predominantly by the locations of the sources, whereas the level of heterogeneity produced when the network recovers will depend not only on the locations of the sinks, but also on drivers\u2019 behavior as they disperse through the network towards those sinks. Therefore, whenever the spatial distribution of the sources is sufficiently uniform, one would expect that the heterogeneity of loading should be smaller than that of recovery. A recent study of the two-bin model presented in Gayah and Daganzo (2011), under the assumption of perfectly symmetric loading, provides a simple analytical explanation of this behavior. If the constraint of perfectly uniform loading is relaxed however, different behavior can arise. If loading is sufficiently non-uniform then density may in fact become more heterogeneously distributed in loading than in recovery, which would produce anticlockwise hysteresis loops in the MFD, rather than clockwise loops. To study this possibility, we have therefore simulated networks in which the boundary sources/sinks are stronger than the internal sources/sinks. Situations where such behavior might arise include commuter corridors as well as arterial networks in the presence of perimeter control, or gating. The most extreme example of such loading is when the strength of the internal sources and sinks is set identically to zero, corresponding to the profiles in Fig. 12. Consider Fig. 12e for the SOTL signal system. During the first 10h of the simulation corresponding to the lead-up to, and recovery from, the morning peak hour, we observe two distinct hysteresis loops. The first of these loops, which occurs at moderately high density, is traced out by the flow-density curve in an anticlockwise direction, as time evolves, while the second loop, occuring at low density, is traced out in a clockwise direction. As the density then increases again due to the afternoon peak, a second, larger, anticlockwise hysteresis loop is traced out at high densities. The low-density behavior is qualitatively similar to that observed for uniform loading, and the clockwise loops in the MFD again coincide with anticlockwise loops in the density heterogeneity, Fig. 12f; c.f. Fig. 11a and b for example. The behavior at moderately high density is the opposite of that observed for uniform loading, but it can again be understood from Fig. 12f as follows. An initially empty network is loaded just above its capacity, in a non-uniform manner which leaves some links very congested, with others still uncongested. After the morning peak (around hour 6), as the inflow drops and outflow increases, vehicles disperse through the network, and the density becomes more evenly distributed. Fig. 13 illustrates this effect by comparing the spatial density distibrutions during loading and recovery, at a fixed value of the network density, during the afternoon peak. We clearly observe that the center of the network is less congested than the boundary region during loading, whereas the distribution during recovery is reasonably uniform. These heterogeneity differences cause the anticlockwise loops seen in the MFD at high density. In Section 6.3 we show that this behavior can be predicted using a heterogeneous version of the two-bin model discussed in Gayah and Daganzo (2011). The two scenarios, boundary loading and uniform loading, can be considered opposite extremes; in practice, one would likely expect that the strength of the internal sources and sinks would be non-zero but smaller than the boundary rates. We therefore also simulated a scenario with \u03b3 = \u03b1/3 and \u03b4 = \u03b2/3. The results are intermediate between the uniform loading and boundary loading cases discussed above. In particular, for the SOTL system, we observe both anticlockwise and clockwise hysteresis at high density: anticlockwise hysteresis during hours 4\u20138 (as observed for boundary loading); and clockwise hysteresis during hours 12\u201316 (as observed for uniform loading). Finally, let us compare the behavior of the SOTL simulations with the corresponding simulations of SCATS. For both boundary loading and uniform loading, we again find that SOTL has lower values of density heterogeneity and higher capacities than both the SCATS systems. For the specific case of boundary loading, we note that while Fig. 12a and c display clockwise loops in the MFDs of SCATS-L and SCATS-F, as observed for SOTL, the anticlockwise loops appear to be absent. By zooming in on Fig. 12d, one finds that there is, in fact, a small clockwise hysteresis loop in the density heterogeneity plot for SCATS-L, at the start of the final recovery process, and similarly zooming in on Fig. 12c one observes a corresponding anticlockwise loop in the MFD. However the loops are comparable to the size of the error bars in the simulations and so their existence cannot be firmly established. The presence of strong anticlockwise loops for SOTL but not for SCATS can be understood as a consequence of SOTL\u2019s generally stronger ability to homogenize the network density. 6.3 Two-Bin model The two-bin model was introduced by Daganzo et al. (2011). It represents the interaction between two subnetworks, or bins, in a larger road network. A state of the system consists of the pair (\u03c1 1, \u03c1 2), and the expression for the flow J(\u00b7) in each bin is assumed to be given by the same triangular MFD, with capacity (\u03c1 c, J c) and jam density \u03c1 j. The dynamical evolution of the system is defined by the following system of ordinary differential equations (7a) d \u03c1 1 d t = a 1 - b 1 J ( \u03c1 1 ) + p 2 J ( \u03c1 2 ) - p 1 J ( \u03c1 1 ) L 1 , d \u03c1 2 d t = a 2 - b 2 J ( \u03c1 2 ) + p 1 J ( \u03c1 1 ) - p 2 J ( \u03c1 2 ) L 2 , for \u03c1 1, \u03c1 2 < \u03c1 j, and (7b) d \u03c1 1 dt = d \u03c1 2 dt = 0 if \u03c1 1 or \u03c1 2 = \u03c1 j . The model as stated in (7) has eight free parameters: a i , the rate of inflow into bin i; b i , the proportion of traffic flowing out of the network from bin i; p i , the proportion of traffic turning out of bin i into the other bin; L i , the total network length of bin i. The perfectly symmetric case, in which a 1 = a 2, b 1 = b 2, p 1 = p 2, and L 1 = L 2, was studied in detail by Gayah and Daganzo (2011). It was found that if hysteresis was observed in the aggregated MFD, it was typically oriented clockwise. The results for the uniform loading scenario studied in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 are in perfect agreement with these results. In this section, we consider instead a highly asymmetric case, in which a 2 = b 2 =0, and p 1 and p 2 are not necessarily equal. This can be viewed as a two-bin model of the boundary loading scenario studied in Sections 6.1 and 6.2. In this interpretation, bin 1 corresponds to the links adjacent to the boundary, while bin 2 corresponds to the remainder of the bulk links, see Fig. 3. This implies that L 1 is slightly smaller than L 2. The aggregated density and flow are then (8) \u03c1 = L 1 \u03c1 1 + L 2 \u03c1 2 L 1 + L 2 , J = L 1 J ( \u03c1 1 ) + L 2 J ( \u03c1 2 ) L 1 + L 2 . Fig. 14 a and b shows phase plots for the system (7) during loading and recovery, respectively, for a typical choice of the model parameters. The loading process has a 1 =0.1 and b 1 =0, while the recovery process has a 1 =0 and b 1 =0.1, so that no vehicles exit the network during loading, and no vehicles enter the network during recovery. In both cases p 1 =0.08 and p 2 =0.02. For the perfectly symmetric case studied by Gayah and Daganzo (2011), trajectories that begin on the line \u03c1 1 = \u03c1 2, remain on that line. We note that for the asymmetric system studied here, however, this is not the case. To illustrate the effect on the MFD of combining such loading and recovery processes, let us now consider the black trajectories shown in Fig. 14a and b. In Fig. 14a, the black trajectory starts with \u03c1 1 =0 and \u03c1 2 =0, which corresponds to the initial state of the boundary loading scenario simulated in Section 6.1. Suppose we stop the loading process at a finite time, denoted by the star in Fig. 14a, and then begin a recovery process. The resulting recovery trajectory is shown in black in Fig. 14b. The diamond (triangle) in Fig. 14a (Fig. 14b) shows the location at which maximum flow was attained on the black loading (recovery) trajectory. In Fig. 14c we show the trajectory in the \u03c1 \u2212 J plane resulting from combining these loading and recovery processes, superimposed on the underlying MFD of the model. There is a clearly visible anticlockwise hysteresis loop as the system recovers from high density, precisely as observed for the boundary loading scenario simulated in Section 6.1. Since the recovery path in Fig. 14b initially moves towards more balanced states, i.e. moves toward the diagonal, the higher flow during the initial stages of recovery can be seen as a consequence of lower heterogeneity, as observed in Section 6.2. Note that the location of the maximum flow during recovery occurs precisely at zero heterogeneity, \u03c1 1 = \u03c1 2. As the recovery trajectory continues further, Fig. 14b shows that the heterogeneity increases again, and the corresponding trajectory in the MFD then drops below the original loading curve and a clockwise hysteresis loop results. This combination of anticlockwise hysteresis loops at high density and clockwise loops at low density agrees exactly with the behavior observed in Fig. 12e. This behavior is quite generic, and similar MFD hysteresis is observed for any similar pairs of loading and recovery trajectories, whenever loading begins with \u03c1 2 \u226a \u03c1 c and ends with \u03c1 1 \u226b \u03c1 c. As a final observation, Fig. 14d shows an alternative loading process, for which all parameters are the same as Fig. 14a except that p 1 =0.12 is slightly higher. While the trajectories are qualitatively similar, it is apparent that even a small variation in the rate that vehicles from the boundary can enter the network can produce quite different loading trajectories, starting from a given initial state. One significant factor that would contribute to the effective value of p 1 in an actual arterial network is the type of traffic signal system used. From the perspective of the two-bin model, it is therefore unsurprising that different types of signal systems can have rather different levels of hysteresis in their MFDs. 7 Discussion We have studied Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (MFDs) on a square-lattice traffic network for a variety of traffic scenarios. In particular we have studied networks as a function of both anisotropy (directional bias) and uniformity (presence of bulk sinks and sources) in demand. We furthermore studied the impact of various turning probabilities, and we have studied these networks with three different traffic signal systems, SCATS-F, SCATS-L and SOTL. Our main findings include the following: \u2022 For time-independent demand, MFDs do exist even when demand is not uniform, but their shapes depend on the nature of the non-uniformity: \u2013 Systems with more uniformly distributed demand achieve similar capacities, but capacities occur at higher densities; \u2013 Systems subject to anisotropic exogenous demand display a steep drop in the flow just beyond the maximum of the MFD; \u2013 As turning rates increase, capacity and jamming occur at lower densities, capacity decreases, and the congested branch of the MFD decreases; \u2022 For time-dependent demand, MFDs show clear hysteresis which is strongly correlated with the spatial heterogeneity of the density. The qualitative behavior of this hysteresis is strongly dependent on the level of uniformity of loading and unloading; \u2022 The choice of traffic signal system plays a crucial role in determining a network\u2019s performance. The idealized control scheme SOTL, which is designed to uniformize the network density distribution, always results in a higher MFD compared to the commonly used SCATS system. SOTL increases the network capacity and produces higher flows in the congested regime. We finally remark that given the strong dependence of the choice of traffic signal system on the shape of the MFD, one can in principle use MFDs as a metric for comparing the performance of different traffic signal systems.

Appendix A Details of traffic signal control systems A.1 SCATS The strategy for adapting the cycle length C based on the volume ratio R, defined in (5), of a master node is presented as below. Algorithm 1 SCATS cycle length decision Case 1: if C = MIN & R >0.4, then C = STOPPER Case 2: if C = STOPPER & R <0.2, then C = MIN Case 3: if R >0.95, then C =min{C + STEP, MAX} Case 4: if R <0.85, then C =max{C \u2212 STEP, STOPPER} Otherwise: C remains unchanged. The parameters used in Algorithm 1 are set as follows: MIN: minimum cycle length 44s; STOPPER: stopper cycle length 64s; MAX: maximum cycle length 130s; STEP: fixed amount of increment/decrement 6s. Fig. A.15 illustrates the cycle length decision process implemented by Algorithm 1. The main strategy underlying the above algorithm is to attempt to keep the volume ratio within the range [0.85,0.95]. If the volume ratio was high during the previous cycle (over 0.95) the cycle length is increased by a fixed amount. Otherwise if green time was wasted on the previous cycle, signaled by R <0.85, the cycle length is decreased. The STOPPER is included to allow a steep increase in the cycle length due to a sudden increase in traffic volume, when the cycle length is at its minimum. The volume ratio of a master node, m, is given by (A.1) R ( m ) = R ( l \u2217 , P \u2217 ) , where l \u2217 is the unique inlink flowing in the linked direction, and P \u2217 is the linked phase. The cycle length of each slave node is equal to that of its master. For a non-subsystem node, n, the adaptive cycle length strategy remains valid, except that the volume ratio is defined by maximizing R over all inlinks and phases, (A.2) R ( n ) = max P max l R ( l , P ) . Given the cycle length C, the split time of phase P for a master or non-subsystem node is given by (A.3) S = d ( P ) \u2211 P d ( P ) [ C - number of phases \u00d7 S min - total amber time ] + S min , with the demand function d ( P ) = max l V ( l , P ) where l is an inlink of phase P . We impose a fixed delay T wait to the nodes each time there is a phase change and the next phase does not share any path with the current one. During that time, only right-turning vehicles that have been giving way to others may traverse the intersection. This delay mimics the amber time for phase change. We set T wait to 2s in our simulations, however the precise value does not impact greatly on the simulation results provided that the split times are not too small. For SCATS, the total amber time in a cycle is 4s. The minimum split time in our simulations was set to S min =5s. For slave nodes, we demand that the split time of the linked phase must be the same as that of its master node. The remaining portion of the cycle is then shared between the other phases according to their maximum inlink volumes. Initially, at the beginning of each simulation, the cycle length of each node is set to the minimum value and the split time plan is chosen based on the turning probabilities. We note that since split times are adaptive, the initial condition for the splits is unimportant. A.2 SOTL SOTL is an acyclic signal system, in the sense that no fixed ordering of the phases is imposed. The following algorithm provides a precise description of how SOTL operates at each time step and node. The observable \u03c4(n) acts as a clock for node n, recording how long the current phase has been activate for. Algorithm 2 SOTL Increment \u03c4(n) for each phase P \u2260 P active do Increment \u03c4 ( P ) end for if \u03c4(n)> S min then Let \u03a0 \u2032 = { P \u2208 \u03a0 = { P 1 , P 2 , \u2026 } : \u03ba ( P ) > \u03b8 } if \u03a0\u2032\u2260\u2205 then Let \u03a0 \u2033 = { P \u2208 \u03a0 \u2032 : \u03ba ( P ) = max P \u2032 \u2208 \u03a0 \u2032 \u03ba ( P \u2032 ) } Let \u03a0 \u2034 = { P \u2208 \u03a0 \u2033 : \u03c4 ( P ) = max P \u2033 \u2208 \u03a0 \u2033 \u03c4 ( P \u2033 ) } Uniformly at random choose P \u2208 \u03a0 \u2034 and set P active = P Set \u03c4 ( P active ) = 0 Set \u03c4(n)=0 end if end if When the idle time of node n is greater than the minimal split time, S min, SOTL chooses the phases for which the threshold functions \u03ba are greater than the threshold \u03b8, and among those it selects the phases with the maximal \u03ba, then among those it selects the phases with the longest idle time. If there is more than one element in this latter set, then the next active phase will be chosen at random from it, however in practice there is typically only one such phase to choose from. The fixed delay T wait is also applied to SOTL. In our simulations, the minimal split time was set to S min =5s, as was done for SCATS. References Buisson and Ladier, 2009 C. Buisson C.

In particular, we simulate realistic signal systems that include signal linking and adaptive cycle times, and compare their performance against a highly adaptive system of self-organizing traffic signals which is designed to uniformly distribute the network density. We find that for networks with time-independent boundary conditions, well-defined stationary MFDs are observed, whose shape depends on the particular signal system used, and also on the level of heterogeneity in the system. We find that the spatial heterogeneity of both density and flow provide important indicators of network performance. We also study networks with time-dependent boundary conditions, containing morning and afternoon peaks. In this case, intricate hysteresis loops are observed in the MFDs which are strongly correlated with the density heterogeneity. Our results show that the MFD of the self-organizing traffic signals lies above the MFD for the realistic systems, suggesting that by adaptively homogenizing the network density, overall better performance and higher capacity can be achieved.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2013-03-31", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url":
