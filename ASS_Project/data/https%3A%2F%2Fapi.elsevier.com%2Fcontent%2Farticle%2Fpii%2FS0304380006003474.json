Abstract A method for parameters estimation of stage-specific mortality and fecundity rate functions in poikilotherm organisms, and in particular for arthropod structured population, is proposed. The application of this method requires three types of information: stage-frequency data of a sampled population, development rate function and time evolution of forcing variables affecting the rate functions. By means of an individual-based model (a microscopic model) the number of eggs produced by the adults is generated starting from the number of individuals collected at each sampling time. Using a compartmental model (a macroscopic model) a stage-structured population dynamics is described and compared with observations. Non-linear regression methods based on least square principle are used to estimate the optimal parameters of the mortality and fecundity rate functions combining microscopic and macroscopic models. As a case study, the parameter estimation of the temperature-dependent mortality function of olives fruit fly Bactrocera oleae is presented. Keywords Parameter estimation Arthropod populations Individual-based models Compartmental models Olives fruit fly 1 Introduction A critical point in modelling populations dynamics, and in particular for arthropods, is to have biodemographic functions, such as development, fecundity and mortality rate functions, with a solid biological background and known parameters (Carey, 1993, 2001). However, parameter estimation is one of the weak points in ecological modelling (J\u00f8rgensen, 1997; McCallum, 2000). If it is possible to set up laboratory experiments where population dynamics is led to the simplified situation of a single cohort life table, biodemographic functions as well as their parameters can be easily estimated (Manly, 1989). In some cases it is not possible to perform parameter estimation in laboratory or experimental data are not sufficiently reliable, in particular for fecundity and mortality functions. In such cases it is necessary to resort to the analysis of stage-frequency data coming from field population sampling. Sophisticated demographic methods have been proposed to analyze stage-frequency data, they are thoroughly discussed by Manly (1989, 1990). However such methods display a series of important problems specially referring to the population of arthropods. In particular, three categories of problems can be recognized. (i) Technical problems may derive from the use of chronological time in life tables analysis, while the development of a cohort is better described by its dependence on physiological time (as a function of biological and environmental parameters). Therefore, the transformation of chronological time into physiological time can be necessary, even if complex in some cases, and stage-specific development rate functions and time series of temperature data are needed. (ii) Further problems concern sampling procedure and sampling variables definition. Sharp differences in stage biology (frequently due to high mobility of adults) may make hard or impossible the use of a single sampling technique for the different stages of a species and to convert different estimates in a common definition of density. The consequences of this limitation may be heavy, and equivalent, in practice, to the lack of information on adult abundance making impossible the fecundity estimation. (iii) The most important problems in the application of classical demographic approaches to the analysis of field stage-frequency data, arise when mortality and fecundity patterns are interested by complexity deriving from both species-specific life-history strategies or responses to variation in environmental forcing variables. In particular, in the analysis of life table mortality rates are assumed to be equal for all the individuals in the population or at least within a stage. In some cases this condition can be accepted, in many other cases this is not admitted mostly because of both natural or man made fast variations concerning environmental conditions (e.g. abrupt changes of temperature) or resources (e.g. variation in plant content and biomass which determine resource suitability, acceptability and availability for a phytophagous, see Schowalter, 2000). Concerning the fecundity, the analysis of stage-frequency data with recruitment is relatively simple under the hypothesis that the effect of reproduction occurs in the first stage for a short period of time. Such instantaneous generation of a new cohort does not hold in the case of continuous reproduction, given that the income in the first stage depends on the uninterrupted contribution of adults present in the population and on their physiological age distribution (Manly, 1989). In such cases many problems arise in parameter estimation, particularly because the intra-stage frequencies change also for the continuous appearance and development of new individuals. Demographic patterns characterized by continuous recruitment with partially or completely overlapping generations are particularly important since this is the typical situation of iteroparity, a common reproductive strategy in arthropod species. In these conditions it is possible to analyze the life-table if at least one of these conditions holds true (Manly, 1989): (a) it is possible to link the recruitment in stage 1 to the number of individuals in the population; (b) the time distribution of the incoming organisms is sufficiently simple and it can be described with few parameters. This can be done only by demographic models. Most of them assumes that the age of the individuals is known, in this case two different approaches can be adopted: methods based on Lotka integral equation (Manly, 1989) and methods based on matrix models, like, for example, the Leslie matrix (Caswell and Twombly, 1989; Caswell, 2001). As an alternative to these approaches, whose main limits are in the assumptions they are based on, many other empirical methods have been proposed that reduce to the minimum the assumptions for the analysis. These methods start from stage-frequency data and refer to different types of population dynamics models. Among them are the approaches based on the compartmental model proposed by Elster (Faddy, 1989; Cappio Borlino et al., 1991; Di Cola et al., 1999) and those derived from the McKendrick\u2013von Foerster model (Wood and Nisbet, 1991; Wood, 1994). Potentialities of these simulation methods are considerable since they allow estimating at the same time mortality and reproductive profiles as a function of time and/or age. However, even if they are able to deal with many unknown parameters, they require a known functional form for both mortality and reproduction. To overcome problems affecting classical demographic methods dealing with continuous recruitment and overlapping generations, a new modelling approach is here developed with the specific objective to estimate parameters in mortality and fecundity rate functions of given functional form in poikilotherm organisms and arthropods in particular. This method relies on the joint use of two simulation models: a microscopic or individual-based model, IBM (or i-state model) and a macroscopic or classical model (p-state model) (Metz and Diekmann, 1986; DeAngelis and Mooij, 2005). The microscopic model is a particle-based model (Hockney and Eastwood, 1989) which considers as inputs the stage-specific developmental rate functions of the species, the stage-frequency data collected at discrete time points, and the time evolution of forcing variables affecting development, mortality and fecundity. Starting from these information the IBM is able to define the individual age distribution and the profile of newly laid eggs (recruitment) along both the continuous chronological and physiological time, tackling the limit of classical demographic approach above described in point (i). The macroscopic model is a compartmental model (Di Cola et al., 1999) used to simulate the dynamics of a structured population where the recruitment is obtained via the microscopic model and the transferring functions are given by development functions. In the estimation procedure, through the application of non-linear regression method based on least square principle the optimal parameters of the mortality and fecundity rate functions are obtained combining microscopic and macroscopic models. Moreover, a special case where no information on adult abundance and/or development rate function is available is considered to address the problem (ii) that classical as well as modelling approaches encounter in such situations. In this case, by means of the individual-based model the profile of emerging adults along both chronological and physiological time is reconstructed. Then, under the assumption of known adult survival profile an estimate of the fecundity function can be derived. The special case is also able to tackle problems deriving from physiological age definition and measurement in the adult stage. Since the method here proposed deals with poikilotherm organisms, the development is considered as temperature-dependent. As mentioned above, if temperature data series are available it is possible to overcome difficulties in describing life tables according to physiological age and time. Moreover, the approach here developed takes into account that especially in arthropods mortality and fecundity are influenced by external forcing variables, often by temperature. The method is able to define the dependence of mortality and fecundity rate functions from forcing variables which temporal dynamics is known, addressing the problems deriving from intra-stage variability in species-specific life-history strategies (see problem (iii) in the list above). Noteworthy is the contribution offered by the individual-based model in the method here proposed, according to the importance assigned by many authors to such modelling approach in parameter estimation (Fahse et al., 1998; DeAngelis and Mooij, 2005). The main advantages we obtained by the use of an IBM can be summarized in: (a) the precise definition of physiological age-structure and physiological time distribution of the individuals; (b) the possibility to derive the recruitment profile and the recruitment as well as the adult emergence profiles in the special case (information on adult abundance or adult development rate unavailable); (c) achieving such profiles represents a new contribution in ODE estimation in respect of other simulation methods used in biodemography and it offers the remarkable advantages of a reduction in functions and parameters to be estimated. The method has been applied to the parameter estimation in olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae (Gmelin) (Diptera: Tephritidae), the key pest of olive growing, which population dynamics is characterized by partially overlapping generation and continuous reproduction. In the case study the estimation procedure is limited to the stage-specific mortality rate functions. 2 Methods 2.1 Preliminary hypothesis 2.1.1 Population structure It is considered a population subdivided in k stages, i =1, 2, \u2026, k, where i =1 denotes eggs, i =2, 3, \u2026, k \u22121 immature or pre-imaginal stages and i = k adults. The physiological age of an individual, however it is defined, ranges between 0 and k. Within a given stage, individuals are distributed along physiological age x, thus in any stage i, the number of individuals with physiological age x, at time t \u00af , N i ( x , t \u00af ) for x \u2208(i \u22121, i], is known. 2.1.2 Population processes Population abundance in a given spatial or habitat unit and physiological age structure change due to development, mortality and reproduction. Immigration and emigration are neglected. Individual physiological age increases according to a development rate function (1) \u03c3 i ( \u03c8 _ ( t ) ) depending on stage i and on external forcing variables \u03c8 _ ( t ) which temporal dynamics is supposed known. Here, the temperature \u03c8(t) is the only external forcing variable considered. We introduce the assumptions that stage-specific mortality rate functions (2) \u03bc i ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) and fecundity rate function (3) \u03c6 ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) are both dependent only on temperature \u03c8(t). The model can be extended to the case in which: (a) forcing variables occurring in mortality and fecundity rate functions are not the same and/or they are in turn different from that occurring in development rate function; (b) the functions (1)\u2013(3) vary also within the stage. The model is studied under the assumption that development, mortality and fecundity rate functions are deterministic. A stochastic extension can be obtained, but in the present work this aspect is not addressed. 2.1.3 Requirements for model application The method here proposed aims to estimate parameters of mortality and fecundity rate functions for a poikilotherm population provided that are given: (i) the functional form of these functions, (ii) the development rate functions for each stage, (iii) the abundance N i * ( t j ) sampled at different times t j , j =1, 2, \u2026, J, for each stage i, (iv) a time series data of temperature \u03c8(t). However, when adult population abundance is unknown (i.e. the adults are highly mobile and can be sampled by different techniques leading to a different definition of density, or their development rate function is not defined), a special version of the method can be obtained (see Section 2.4). Concerning the choice of mortality and fecundity functional form, advantages may derive from selection of functions that can interpolate the typical mortality and fecundity patterns described for a given species. If such patterns are unknown it may be useful to refer to the general properties of some mortality and fecundity functions generally used in biodemography (Carey, 2001). 2.2 Estimation of the time-dependent recruitment pattern Let N 1(0, t) be the recruitment pattern, that is the number of eggs, with physiological age x =0, laid at time t, and let (t j\u22121, t j ] be the interval between two consecutive samplings. The sampling interval \u0394t j = t j \u2212 t j\u22121 is not necessarily constant. Further advantages derive if the interval \u0394t j is smaller or at least equal to the sum of development times of all stages. In fact, in this case the recruitment pattern N 1(0, t) along all the interval (t j\u22121, t j ] is constructed bringing back all the individuals sampled at time t j . In the following we suppose this condition holds true. Finally, it is necessary that sampling methods and techniques assure, for different stages and consecutive samplings, a common definition of the abundance and the same accuracy in the estimates. The distribution N 1(0, t) is unknown, but it can be obtained, in the interval (t j\u22121, t j ], from population abundances N i * ( t j ) sampled at time t j . The strategy followed to obtain N 1(0, t) relies on an individual-based model which brings back the physiological age of each individual sampled at time t j down to x =0. Single individuals may be simulated as discrete entities. Alternatively groups of individuals may be followed as discrete entities which abundance is given by the integral, over a small physiological age interval, of the global physiological age distribution N(x, t j ) derived from the single intra-stage distributions N i (x, t j ) (Breckling et al., 2006). Here the second option has been adopted, but the method can be applied also to the first option. Suppose that the physiological age of each stage is subdivided in H subintervals of width \u0394x =1/H. Let \u0394 x i j h (h =1, 2, \u2026, H), a generic subinterval of physiological age of stage i at time t j , then \u0394 x i j h = ( x i j h \u2212 1 , x i j h ] = ( i \u2212 1 + ( h \u2212 1 ) \u0394 x , i \u2212 1 + h \u0394 x ] . The projection t i j h on time axis of the right bound of this interval is determined calculating the time required by an individual of age 0 at time t i j h to reach age x i j h at time t j (see Fig. 1 ). Following Buffoni et al. (2004), that developed a microscopic stochastic model for individual development, this occurs when (4) \u222b t i j h t j \u03c3 ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) d t = i \u2212 1 + h \u0394 x where the development rate function \u03c3(\u03c8(t)) is stage-specific. Analogously, we can determine the projection t i j h \u2212 1 , on the time axis, of the left bound of \u0394 x i j h so that (5) \u222b t i j h \u2212 1 t j \u03c3 ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) d t = i \u2212 1 + ( h \u2212 1 ) \u0394 x . The intra-stage continuous physiological age distribution and the derived global age distribution N(x, t j ) are unknown. Here it is proposed a procedure for their estimation starting from N i * ( t j ) , (i =1, 2, \u2026, k). This procedure gives a coarse approximation of the continuous distribution which accuracy depends, among others, on the number of stages considered. The following assumptions are given: (a) the abundance of individuals in each stage observed at a given instant is proportional to the residence times of individuals in the same stage (then it follows that it is a function of \u03c3(\u03c8(t)); (b) the outward flux of individuals of a stage must be equal to inward flux in the subsequent stage N i (i, t j )= N i+1(i, t j ). As a consequence of (a), to obtain the continuous distribution N(x, t j ), the observed abundance can be normalized, for example, with respect to the stage with the minimum development rate \u03c3 min. It follows that the generic observation N i * ( t j ) will be transformed by N \u00af i ( t j ) = N i * ( t j ) \u03c3 i ( \u03c8 ( t j ) ) \u03c3 min ( \u03c8 ( t j ) ) . The continuous distribution function N \u00af ( x , t j ) is obtained by fitting the abundance N \u00af i ( t j ) considered as placed in the middle of the corresponding physiological age interval, that is in x = i \u22120.5 (i =1, 2, \u2026, k). Then it is possible to estimate the abundance of individuals in the interval \u0394 x i j h by means of the interpolating function N \u00af ( x , t j ) ; this number is given by (6) N ( \u0394 x i j h , t j ) = \u03c3 min ( \u03c8 ( t j ) ) \u03c3 i ( \u03c8 ( t j ) ) \u222b x i j h \u2212 1 x i j h N \u00af ( x , t j ) d x . Furthermore, all the individuals not observed in the sample because died in the interval (t j\u22121, t j ], need to be to considered, so the abundance N ( \u0394 x i j h , t j ) is corrected including the number M ( \u0394 x i j h ) of the individuals laid in each subinterval \u0394 t i j h = ( t i j h , t i j h \u2212 1 ] and successively died (7) M ( \u0394 x i j h ) = \u222b t i j h t j \u03bc ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) N ( \u0394 x i j h , t j ) d t \u2212 \u222b t i j h \u2212 1 t j \u03bc ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) N ( \u0394 x i j h , t j ) d t where \u03bc(\u03c8(t)) is stage-specific mortality. It follows that the number of eggs laid in \u0394 t i j h will be given by (8) N 1 ( 0 , t ) = N ( \u0394 x i j h , t j ) + M ( \u0394 x i j h ) for t \u2208 \u0394 t i j h . Since the mortality \u03bc(\u03c8(t)) has known form but contains unknown parameters, it is not possible to obtain N 1(0, t) directly from (8). It follows that the computation of N 1(0, t) is recursively included in the estimation procedure described in Section 2.3. The calculation of the number of eggs derived by the individuals sampled at time t j is stopped when the projection of the physiological age on the time axis reaches t j\u22121. In fact, individuals sampled at time t j , having physiological age greater than this limit were already considered in the sampled population at time t j\u22121. 2.3 Parameters estimation of mortality and fecundity functions Following the macroscopic approach, the population dynamics N i (t), i =1, 2, \u2026, k is described by a compartmental model through the system of ODE (Cappio Borlino et al., 1991) (9) d N 1 ( t ) d t = N 1 ( 0 , t ) \u2212 \u03c3 1 ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) N 1 ( t ) \u2212 \u03bc 1 ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) N 1 ( t ) . (10) d N i ( t ) d t = \u03c3 i \u2212 1 ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) N i \u2212 1 ( t ) \u2212 \u03c3 i ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) N i ( t ) \u2212 \u03bc i ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) N i ( t ) , i = 2 , \u2026 , k \u2212 1 (11) d N k ( t ) d t = \u03c3 k \u2212 1 ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) N k \u2212 1 ( t ) \u2212 \u03bc k ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) N k ( t ) where \u03bc i (\u03c8(t)) are mortality functions of known form but unknown parameters. The parameters of the mortality functions \u03bc i (\u03c8(t)) are estimated applying the least square method which considers the differences between the sampling data collected at every time t j and the solution of the equations at the same times. Generally, systems (9)\u2013(11) does not admit solution linear in the parameters, so the least square estimate can only be calculated applying iterative numerical methods (Rawlings et al., 1998). In systems (9)\u2013(11) an unknown function appear, that is the recruitment N 1(0, t). It can be estimated as explained in Section 2.2 given the parameters of the mortality function. It follows that the estimation procedure of the mortality function involves the estimation of N 1(0, t). More precisely, starting from a set of initial parameters an estimate of N 1(0, t) is calculated; then the parameter estimation procedure for the mortality function updates the parameters and a new function N 1(0, t) is computed using the method of Section 2.2. The recursive procedure goes on until optimal parameters are obtained. To estimate parameters of the fecundity rate function of a given functional form \u03c6(\u03c8(t)), the following relation is used: (12) N k ( t ) \u03c6 ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) = N 1 ( 0 , t ) Comparing the sampled adult abundance with the values of N k (t) solution to (12) at the same sampling times, an estimate for the parameters of \u03c6(\u03c8(t)) can be obtained. Observe that it can be necessary to regularize the behaviour of N 1(0, t) in order to estimate parameters of mortality and fecundity functions more easily. 2.4 Special case: parameter estimation with unknown adult abundance In this section a special case in which adult abundance is unknown or its definition is inhomogeneous with respect to the pre-imaginal stages is considered. A remarkable advantage of the method is to avoid difficulties in definition and measurement of adult physiological age and adult development rate function. As a result it is impossible to estimate adult mortality as done in the previous case. A method allowing parameter estimation of a given function of adult fecundity is here proposed providing a mortality function for the individuals in this stage. A method analogous to that applied in the previous section allows to estimate the adults emergence pattern N k (k \u22121, t). In this case a forward projection of the individuals N i * ( t j \u2212 1 ) , sampled at time t j\u22121, is considered (see Fig. 1). For each physiological age subinterval \u0394 x i j \u2212 1 h in the pre-imaginal stages, the position on the time axis of the forward projection of its lower and upper bounds are calculated by means of an individual-based model. Analogously to (4), the position of the upper bound t i j \u2212 1 h is given by (13) \u222b t j \u2212 1 t i j \u2212 1 h \u03c3 ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) d t = i \u2212 1 + h \u0394 x and that of the lower bound t i j \u2212 1 h \u2212 1 by (14) \u222b t j \u2212 1 t i j \u2212 1 h \u2212 1 \u03c3 ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) d t = i \u2212 1 + ( h \u2212 1 ) \u0394 x . Following the method presented in Section 2.2, from the discrete distribution N i * ( t j \u2212 1 ) i =1, 2, \u2026, k \u22121, an interpolating continuous function N \u00af ( x , t j \u2212 1 ) is obtained which approximates the normalized distribution of the abundance with respect to the physiological age. From this distribution an estimate of the number of individuals in the subinterval \u0394 x i j \u2212 1 h at time t j\u22121 can be derived (15) N ( \u0394 x i j \u2212 1 h , t j \u2212 1 ) = \u03c3 min ( \u03c8 ( t j \u2212 1 ) ) \u03c3 i ( \u03c8 ( t j \u2212 1 ) ) \u222b x i j h \u2212 1 x i j h N \u00af ( x , t j \u2212 1 ) d x . Individuals which die before reaching the adult stage are given by (16) M ( \u0394 x i j \u2212 1 h ) = \u222b t j \u2212 1 t i j h \u2212 1 \u03bc ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) N ( \u0394 x i j \u2212 1 h , t j \u2212 1 ) d t \u2212 \u222b t j \u2212 1 t i j h \u03bc ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) N ( \u0394 x i j \u2212 1 h , t j \u2212 1 ) d t . It follows that, starting from the individuals observed in the sub-interval \u0394 x i j \u2212 1 h , the total number of adults N k (k \u22121, t), obtained considering development and mortality processes, is given by (17) N k ( k \u2212 1 , t ) = N ( \u0394 x i j \u2212 1 h , t j \u2212 1 ) \u2212 M ( \u0394 x i j \u2212 1 h ) for t \u2208 ( t i j \u2212 1 h \u2212 1 , t i j \u2212 1 h ) . The forward process is stopped when the projection of physiological age on time axis is equal to t j . In fact, individuals sampled at time t j\u22121, with physiological age less than this limit, become adults at time t > t j . The number of adults N k (t) satisfies the equation (18) d N k ( t ) d t = N k ( k \u2212 1 , t ) \u2212 \u03bc k ( \u03c8 ( t ) ) N k ( t ) . To estimate parameters of the fecundity rate function of a given functional form \u03c6(\u03c8(t)), when the mortality \u03bc k (\u03c8(t)) is known, relation (12) is used where N k (t) is the solution to (18). Also in this case the parameters of the function \u03c6(\u03c8(t)) can be estimated through the least square method, comparing the distribution N 1(0, t), for t \u2208(t j\u22121, t j ], obtained from the data sampled at time t j , with the solutions to Eq. (12) in the same time interval. Parameters for pre-imaginal mortality functions can be estimated as already explained in Section 2.2. Even in this case it can be necessary to regularize the functions N 1(0, t) and N k (k \u22121, t). 3 Application In this section parameter estimation in stage-specific mortality rate functions for the olive fruit fly B. oleae is considered. Population dynamics of this pest is characterized by partially overlapping generation and continuous reproduction, its life cycle passes through eggs, three larval stages (here grouped in one stage), pupae and adults. Adult females lay eggs into olives, larvae develop at the expense of drupe tissue and pupation may occur either in the drupe or in the soil, in the second case an exit hole of the mature larvae can be observed. The selected case study presents some difficulties in data collection. The principal problems are the following: (a) immature stages sampling needs to observe inside the drupe and for eggs such observation is sometime difficult (especially during fruit ripening), in general this can produce an underestimation of the eggs abundance particularly during the second half of the olives maturation period; (b) counting of mortality events occurred between two consecutive samplings is not easy for difficulties in detection of the dead individuals inside the drupe (in particular, the persistence of the eggs is short) and it is impossible to establish the time of death which allows the attribution of the event to a given sampling interval; (c) mortality of the pupae in the soil can not be estimated, therefore only the mortality in the fruit is considered, this leads to an underestimation of pupal mortality; (d) the adult is a mobile stage, and techniques different from that used for immature are needed for sampling (pheromonic and/or chromotropic traps). Difficulties in point (d) in the list above lead to the special case discussed in Section 2.4. However, the method is here applied only to parameter estimation in stage-specific mortality rate functions for the pre-imaginal stages. Even if possible, the fecundity in Eq. (12) has not been calculated because information reported in literature does not give reliable estimate of mortality function for adults. In order to allow adult fecundity estimate in future work an experimental survey on adult temperature-dependent survival function has been undertaken. The application is based on population stage-frequency data coming from a survey performed during the productive season 2002 in a 3-ha olives crop located in Delianuova (Calabria, Italy) (Licastro, 2004). From July to November, 720 olives were sampled weekly from 30 plants, in 17 sampling sessions. Using a stereomicroscope, live and dead immature individuals were detected in the drupe. In the centre of the crop a weather station collected meteorological data every second hour (air temperature, relative humidity, and rainfalls). In the following models (9)\u2013(11) is explicited for the case of the olive fruit fly populations to give an estimate of mortality rate function parameters. Given a common functional form of mortality, three different sets of parameters are considered for the three immature stages (eggs, larvae and pupae). The analysis proceeds along the following steps: (a) parameters in a mortality function of known form reported in literature are estimated through the procedure described in Section 2.4; (b) to evaluate the goodness of the fit, the population dynamics derived from the model using the estimated parameters is compared with the population abundance data sampled in the field; (c) the behaviour of the mortality rate function versus temperature is represented and discussed; (d) to evaluate the performance of estimation procedure the number of dead organisms in the first two stages (eggs and larvae), calculated by means of the model, is compared with observed mortality in each sample date under the hypothesis that observed dead individuals derive from mortality events occurred in the period between the date considered and the previous sample. Pupal mortality is not considered owing to the assessment problems above mentioned; (e) the estimated mortality function has been validated considering a different B. oleae population dynamics data set collected in Alghero (Sardegna, Italy). In the Mediterranean region, during the summer, when the fruit are susceptible to the fly attack, mortality of B. oleae is strongly dependent on high temperature and low relative humidity. In first approximation it is here supposed that mortality rate (1/day) is a function of the mean of the daily maximum temperatures registered in the previous 7 days \u03bc ( T \u00af max ) (measured in \u00b0C), and following Gilioli and Cossu (2004) it can be modelled by (19) \u03bc ( T \u00af max ) = \u03b1 \u22c5 e \u03b2 T \u00af max . The mortality rate function (19) is considered the same for the three immature stages and depends on two parameters: \u03b1 and \u03b2. Models (9)\u2013(11) reduce to a three ODE system, with stage-specific mortality rate function parameters: \u03b1 1 and \u03b2 1 for eggs, \u03b1 2 and \u03b2 2 for larvae and \u03b1 3 and \u03b2 3 for pupae. The population dynamics is described by (20) d N 1 ( t ) d t = N 1 ( 0 , t ) \u2212 \u03c3 ( a 1 , b 1 , c 1 , T l 1 , T u 1 , T ( t ) ) N 1 ( t ) \u2212 \u03bc ( \u03b1 1 , \u03b2 1 , T \u00af max ) N 1 ( t ) (21) d N 2 ( t ) t d t = \u03c3 ( a 1 , b 1 , c 1 , T l 1 , T u 1 , T ( t ) ) N 1 ( t ) \u2212 \u03c3 ( a 2 , b 2 , c 2 , T l 2 , T u 2 , T ( t ) ) N 2 ( t ) \u2212 \u03bc ( \u03b1 2 , \u03b2 2 , T \u00af max ) N 2 ( t ) (22) d N 3 ( t ) d t = \u03c3 ( a 2 , b 2 , c 2 , T l 2 , T u 2 , T ( t ) ) N 2 ( t ) \u2212 \u03c3 ( a 3 , b 3 , c 3 , T l 3 , T u 3 , T ( t ) ) N 3 ( t ) \u2212 \u03bc ( \u03b1 3 , \u03b2 3 , T \u00af max ) N 3 ( t ) where \u03c3 ( a , b , c , T l , T u , T ( t ) ) = a ( e b ( T \u2212 T l ) \u2212 e b ( T u \u2212 T l ) \u2212 c ( T u \u2212 T ) ) is the development rate function proposed by Logan et al. (1976), depending on the current temperature T(t), and the stage-specific lower T l and upper T u development thresholds. Following Gilioli and Cossu (2004) parameters a, b, c, T l and T u for B. oleae are defined in Table 1 for each stage. To estimate parameters \u03b1 1, \u03b2 1, \u03b1 2, \u03b2 2, \u03b1 3, \u03b2 3 it is necessary to know the recruitment function N 1(0, t) and to solve the ODE system (20)\u2013(22). Unfortunately, the computation of N 1(0, t) requires the knowledge of parameters that have to be estimated. Therefore, as mentioned in Section 2.4, a recursive procedure is needed. Initial values for the parameters are given. Then the algorithm can be summarized in the following steps: 1. the function N 1(0, t) is evaluated following the procedure described in Section 2.2; 2. the ODE system (20)\u2013(22) is numerically solved through a MATLAB function based on Runge-Kutta formula; 3. the solution to systems (20)\u2013(22) is compared with field data at sampling times t 1, t 2, \u2026, t 17 obtaining a new set of parameters using a MATLAB routine. With these new parameters return to step 1 and proceed until optimal parameters are obtained. 4 Results As input for the numerical estimation procedure, the following values for the parameters \u03b1 i and \u03b2 i \u03b1 1 = \u03b1 2 = \u03b1 3 = 0 .02 ; \u03b2 1 = \u03b2 2 = \u03b2 3 = 0 .05 are selected on the basis of the mortality function proposed by Gilioli and Cossu (2004). By means of the MATLAB function lsqcurvefit.m the least square estimates in Table 2 are obtained. The trajectories of eggs, larvae and pupae, solution to systems (20)\u2013(22) with the parameters reported in Table 2, are depicted in Fig. 2 . The simulated trajectory of the larvae is in good agreement with the observed data (Fig. 2(b)). The same is valid for the pupae even if in the first 60 days the sampled values are lower than the estimated one (Fig. 2(c)). This difference can be partially due to the underestimation of pupal mortality as stated before. For the eggs (Fig. 2(a)), the difference between data and simulation outputs can be partially interpreted by the difficulties in the observation of this stage in the fresh tissue of the drupe. However, although for large times the estimated values are far from the observations, they follow the trend of data. The behaviour of the mortality rate functions for the three stages, obtained with the estimated parameters, are represented in Fig. 3 as a function of the temperature T \u00af max , in the range from 15 to 40\u00b0C which corresponds to the range of T \u00af max experimented in the field by the sampled B. oleae population. The trajectories of the mortality rate functions display the same pattern for the three stages and at the same temperature the mortality rate increases from larvae to pupae and to eggs. The behaviour of eggs is characterized by a remarkable increase of mortality with temperature, this makes the eggs the most susceptible stage to the high temperature registered during the Mediterranean summer. The estimated parameters allow also calculating the number of dead individuals. In Fig. 4 the simulated patterns of dead eggs and larvae are compared with the corresponding sampled values. This comparison displays a good estimation of the larval mortality in the first 100 days (when the temperatures are high) and an important overestimation of eggs mortality, such error can be partially explained by the problems in eggs identification and persistence. This problem increases during fruit ripening and leads to an underestimation of observed dead eggs and pupae which forces the system to an overestimation of eggs mortality. As a measure of the goodness of the estimates, the following indexes I i = 1 n \u2212 1 \u2211 j = 1 n ( N i ( t j ) \u2212 N * ( t j ) ) 2 , i = 1 , 2 , 3 are considered, where N 1 * ( t j ) , N 2 * ( t j ) , N 3 * ( t j ) are the observed values of eggs, larvae and pupae at time t j respectively. For the estimated mortality function the index takes the following values I 1 = 4.67 ; I 2 = 1.21 ; I 3 = 1.17. Finally, to validate the mortality model the dynamics of B. oleae in a different area is considered. Models (20)\u2013(22) is applied, using the same mortality functions estimated above, to a set of abundance data collected in Alghero (Sardegna, Italy) from July to October 2003. The dynamics of eggs, larvae and pupae represented in Fig. 5 , confirm that the model is able to predict the behaviour of B. oleae in different geographic areas. In fact, the simulated trajectories of eggs and larvae satisfactorily approximate the trends of field data. A substantial difference between simulation and real data can be observed only in the first part of the pupae dynamics. From the analysis of Figs. 2 and 5, it follows that the estimated mortality rate functions well describe the real mortalities. A further evidence of this fact is given from the indexes I 1 = 2.92 ; I 2 = 6.77 ; I 3 = 4.07 which are of the same order than those of the previous case. 5 Concluding remarks The method here proposed represents a useful tool for parameters estimation in mortality and fecundity rate functions for poikilotherm-structured population. The application of this method requires only the knowledge of the stage abundance sampled at different times, the development rate functions for each stage, and the time evolution of external forcing variables. Through an individual-based model it is possible to approximate the distribution function of the eggs with physiological age 0 years; then a macroscopic model allows to describe the dynamics of the structured population depending on development, mortality and fecundity rate functions. Minimization of the square differences between sampled data and simulated dynamics generates an estimation problem, which involves the computation of the recruitment function and requires a non-linear regression method to supply the optimal parameters. The model has been applied to estimation of mortality rate function in olive fruit fly B. oleae population, the fecundity rate function in such species can not be estimated due to the biology of the species (adult abundance estimates are not homogeneous with the pre-imaginal abundance and no reliable estimation of survival function is available). Results obtained in the case study show the wide possibilities of utilization of the method also in particular cases in which it is not possible to sample all population stages. To validate the estimated mortality functions the same model has been applied to a set of data collected in a different area. Numerical results confirm that the estimated mortality functions represent a good approximation of the field behaviour of B. oleae populations.

The application of this method requires three types of information: stage-frequency data of a sampled population, development rate function and time evolution of forcing variables affecting the rate functions. By means of an individual-based model (a microscopic model) the number of eggs produced by the adults is generated starting from the number of individuals collected at each sampling time. Using a compartmental model (a macroscopic model) a stage-structured population dynamics is described and compared with observations. Non-linear regression methods based on least square principle are used to estimate the optimal parameters of the mortality and fecundity rate functions combining microscopic and macroscopic models. As a case study, the parameter estimation of the temperature-dependent mortality function of olives fruit fly Bactrocera oleae is presented.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2007-01-10", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304380006003474", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Gilioli, Gianni"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pasquali, Sara"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304380006003474"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380006003474"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0304-3800(06)00347-4", "prism:volume": "200", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier B.V.", "dc:title": "Use of individual-based models for population parameters estimation", "prism:copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.
